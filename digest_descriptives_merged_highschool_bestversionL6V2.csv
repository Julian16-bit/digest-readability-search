Normally, your claim would start the week you apply for benefits. But, a policy exists to choose a more favorable start date when necessary. If you wait more than four weeks after you stop working to apply, your claim's start date will be the week you applied. To change the start date to an earlier time, you'll need to ask for it.

When they assess if you qualify for benefits, only the hours you worked before your claim's start week matter. Any hours you worked during your benefit period are not counted.

In short, the interruption of earnings requires a termination of employment and a period of seven consecutive days without work or earnings, from that employment (CUB 71217). Once it is established that an interruption of earnings exists, the start date of a claim can be determined.\nA strict application of EI Act 10 would mean that in most situations the claim would start the week the claimant filed their application for benefits. Therefore, for administrative purposes, the Commission developed a policy that is used to determine the start date of a claim. The Administrative Policy is only applied when it is to the claimant's advantage (Digest 3.1.1).\nWhen a claimant files an application for benefits more than four calendar weeks after the week in which the interruption of earnings occurs, the effective date of the claim will be the Sunday of the week in which the claimant filed the application. A claimant wishing to have their claim start on an earlier date must request an antedate (Digest Chapter 3).\nOnly insurable hours accumulated prior to the start week of the benefit period can be used in determining whether a claimant qualifies, or in the calculation of the number of weeks of benefits that could be payable. Hours worked during a benefit period cannot be used.

Fishing benefits and payments for training or work-sharing will also be explained elsewhere.

During a benefit period, if you're unemployed, benefits can be paid each week after a waiting period. The maximum number of weeks you can receive benefits for in a benefit period is decided when you start your claim. This number depends on two things:

1. The unemployment rate where you live when you filed your claim
2. The amount of work history you have in the past 52 weeks or since your last claim, whichever is shorter

For instance, if the unemployment rate is 6% where you live and you worked 700 hours in the past year, you might get up to 14 weeks of benefits. But if another person worked 1330 hours and lives in an area with over 16% unemployment, they could receive up to 45 weeks of benefits.

This course of action may be  advantageous when, for example, the new benefit rate could be higher or the  claimant could become major attached (Digest 1.2.8 ),  and therefore be entitled to special benefits.\nWhere a claimant requests early termination of their benefit period, in order to allow them to make an informed decision, the Commission must inform  them of the advantages and disadvantages related to such a termination, and  also of the finality of this decision (FCA  434-10; CUB  75288). The Commission cannot decide for the claimant, nor influence their decision.  This decision must be made by the claimant and is final, even though it may  later turn out to be disadvantageous to the claimant. What may be advantageous  at one point in time could be different in the future.\nWhere the claimant requests an early termination of the benefit period, the request will be granted, provided the claimant makes an application for a  new initial claim and qualifies to establish a new benefit period (EI Act  10(8)(d)). In such case, the benefit period is terminated effective the  Saturday preceding the start date of the new benefit period. If no benefits  were paid or payable during the part of the benefit period that was terminated,  then the benefit period may be cancelled (EI Act  10(6)(a)).\nAs is the case with initial and other claims, a request to terminate a benefit period must be made within a reasonable period. A late request to  terminate an established benefit period is considered to have been made at an  earlier date if the claimant shows that good cause existed for the entire  period of delay in making the request. It is irrelevant whether the benefit  period has since terminated or not (EI Act  10(9)). Furthermore, it is irrelevant whether benefits have been paid after  the date of early termination. In such a case, an adjustment in the payment of  benefits will be made. As well, if no benefits were paid in the portion of the  benefit period which is prior to the date of the early termination, the earlier  benefit period may be cancelled (EI Act  10(6)(a)).\nIn order to determine whether the claimant's reasons for delay constitute good cause, the principles concerning antedating, as found in Digest  Chapter 3, are to be followed. Jurisprudence has held that good cause  is simply doing what a reasonable person would do to satisfy themselves as to  their rights and obligations under the act.(FCA  A-154-11; CUB  76454).\nAny week of definite disqualification which had not been served when the benefit period terminated, will be carried forward to the new benefit period, unless  two years have passed since the date of the original disqualifying event (EI  Act 28(3)). No week of disqualification will be carried forward to a subsequent  benefit period if the claimant, since the date of this event, has accumulated 700  hours of insurable employment (EI  Act 28(4)). Furthermore, the disqualification will be deferred (EI  Act 28(5)) for any weeks during which special benefits are payable.

35,35,35,"Under certain circumstances, a benefit period can be stopped or ended early before all weeks of eligibility have been paid or before the 52-week duration of the benefit period is up. 

If no benefits have been paid yet or the person receiving benefits asks for it to be stopped, and they can establish a new benefit period starting from the first week benefits were paid before, then the claim can be cancelled. 

When someone wants to cancel their benefit period, the department must explain the pros and cons of cancelling and make it clear that the decision is final and up to the person claiming benefits. It might be beneficial for the person to cancel early as it could lead to a longer time before they can claim benefits again or a better starting date for a new benefit period. 

The department can also cancel a benefit period automatically when no benefits were paid or payable. At the request of the claimant, a portion of a benefit period before benefits were paid or payable can be cancelled if a new benefit period can be established from the last time benefits were paid. The request to cancel a portion must be justified with a good reason for the delay in making the request.

A request to cancel a portion of a benefit period must also be presented with the advantages and disadvantages explained. If benefits were paid when they shouldn't have been, the overpaid amount must be returned, and then the benefit period may be cancelled. 

Sometimes, benefits were paid during a benefit period when they shouldn't have been due to disqualification being served. It's usually not possible to cancel the benefit period in such cases, except in certain exceptional situations. 

In Quebec, benefits paid under their insurance plan are seen as similar to maternity or parental benefits under the regular employment insurance scheme, but cancelling a benefit period is not included in this comparison. Therefore, benefits from the Quebec plan are not considered when cancelling or ending a benefit period under the regular employment insurance plan.",48.419455219001975,13.25155807365439,14.985893962826673,17.207147526694268,14.589472651993894,11.12736543909348,52.64959686206145,6.923076923076923,0.9091331313053768,0.8808786381374706,3.042299967067769,0.4497636114605869,0.4154071911037855,0.0570809245335095,4.764872521246459,4.0,2.630979319420164,27.15384615384616,24.0,8.346774170495715,1.546742209631728,1.0,0.8270887431637582,353,132,0.3739376770538243,1716,13,1.4.6,Cancellation of a benefit period,Chapter 1 - Basic concepts,"Under very specific conditions, a benefit period can be cancelled or voluntarily terminated before all weeks of entitlement have been paid, or before the 52 week duration of the benefit period has expired.\nA cancelled claim is considered to have never begun (EI Act  10(7)). The Act allows for a claim to be cancelled when:\n\nno benefits have been paid or payable; \nthe claimant requests a cancellation; and \nthe claimant can establish a new benefit period effective the first week for which benefits (on the former claim) were  paid or payable. \n\nWhere a claimant requests cancellation of their benefit period, in order  to allow them to make an informed decision, the Commission must inform them of  the advantages and disadvantages related to such a cancellation, and also of the finality of their decision.  The claimant must not be influenced one way or the other, as it is the claimant who  must decide what action to take.\nOften, it is to the claimant's advantage to cancel an earlier benefit  period, as it may result in a longer qualifying period (Digest 1.2.1), or a more advantageous start date for a new benefit period.\nThe Commission may, without discussing with the claimant, cancel a  benefit period that has terminated, provided that no benefits were paid or payable  in that benefit period (EI Act 10(6)(a)).\nAt the claimant's request, the Commission may also cancel a portion of a benefit period which precedes the first week for which benefits were paid or  payable, provided the following two conditions are met:\n\nthe claimant establishes a new  benefit period commencing the first week for which benefits were paid or  payable (on the previous claim), and,\nthe claimant shows good cause  for any delay in requesting cancellation, throughout the entire period from the day benefits  were first paid or payable and the day the request was made.\n\nIt is irrelevant whether or not the benefit period that the claimant is requesting be cancelled has terminated (EI Act 10(6)(b)).\nWhere a claimant requests cancellation of a portion of their benefit period, in order to allow them to make an informed decision, the Commission must inform the claimant of the advantages and  disadvantages related to such a cancellation. These requests should be treated  in the same manner as requests for early termination (Digest 1.4.4), that is, the claimant must  not be influenced and it is entirely up to the claimant to decide what action to take.\nIt may happen that benefits were paid during a benefit period, although they were not payable and the resulting overpayment must now be reimbursed. In  such a case a request for cancellation of that benefit period may be granted,  as benefits would no longer be considered to have been paid or payable.\nThe expression benefits paid also includes some situations where the claimant did not in fact receive benefits, for example, when a disqualification was being served (Digest  1.9.6). In such cases, generally, the benefit period cannot be cancelled. There  are exceptions when one or more weeks of disqualification served will not  prevent the cancellation of a claim; for example, this could occur where the  cancellation would permit a minor attachment (less than 600 hours) claimant to  become a major attachment claimant, and be entitled to sickness, maternity,  parental, compassionate care, and/or family caregiver benefits (EI  Act 28(7)).\nIn the context of the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan, a principle of equivalence exists, that recognizes the similarity of benefits paid under that plan, to maternity or parental benefits paid under the EI program.\nHowever, the cancellation of a benefit period is not one of the situations included under the principle of equivalence. Consequently, benefits paid under such a provincial plan are not taken into account when considering termination or cancellation of a benefit period.",0.99740547

Weeks of disqualification will not be carried  forward if the claimant has accumulated at least 700 hours of insurable  employment, since the event that led to the disqualification (EI Act 28(4)). All hours of insurable employment  accumulated since the disqualifying event will count towards the 700, regardless of whether the hours are from employment the claimant left voluntarily without just cause, or from which they were dismissed due to  misconduct.\nIn the case of indefinite disqualifications (for the entire benefit period), no disqualification will be carried forward.

54,54,54,"When someone does something that causes them to be disqualified from receiving benefits, the length of this disqualification can vary. It can either be for a specific number of weeks or for the entire time the person is supposed to receive benefits. 

If someone is disqualified for quitting their job voluntarily or for doing something wrong at work, the disqualification will be for the entire time they are supposed to get benefits. If someone is disqualified for refusing a job offer or not taking a suitable job opportunity, the disqualification can be between 7 to 12 weeks. If someone doesn't follow the rules set by the authorities, the disqualification can be between 1 to 6 weeks.

When there is a definite disqualification, the exact number of weeks of disqualification is decided by looking at all the details of the situation.

These rules apply to anyone eligible for EI who makes money while getting EI benefits. But, these rules only apply to certain benefits claims from August 12, 2018, onward.

The main rule is that after a waiting period, claimants can keep 50 cents of EI benefits for each dollar they earn, up to 90% of their weekly earnings. Any money earned over that amount is taken dollar-for-dollar from benefits. This is the default rule for everyone.

There was also a previous rule called Pilot Project 17, in effect between August 7, 2016, and August 11, 2018. Under this rule, claimants could earn up to $75 or 40% of their weekly benefit before deductions. Anything above this amount was taken from benefits.

Claimants who meet certain criteria have a choice of two options regarding how earnings are deducted from benefits. These provisions apply to any eligible EI claimant who earns money while collecting any type of EI benefits.  However, for weeks of sickness and maternity benefits claimed, the provisions only apply to weeks of benefits payable on or after August 12, 2018.\nDefault earnings rule:\nOnce the waiting period has been served, claimants can keep 50 cents of EI benefits for every dollar earned or received while on claim, until their earnings reach 90% of the weekly earnings used to establish their claim. Any earnings above this cap are deducted dollar-for-dollar from benefits. This method is the default rule that automatically applies to all eligible claims.\nTransitional Measure:\nUnder the working while on claim provisions of Pilot  Project 20, which were in effect from August 7, 2016 to August 11, 2018,  claimants had the option to revert to the provisions of an earlier pilot  project (Pilot  Project 17). Pilot project 17 allowed that, once the waiting period was  served, claimants could earn the higher of $75 or 40% of their weekly benefit  rate each week, before any deductions were made from their benefits. Any amount  earned that exceeded this amount was deducted dollar-for-dollar from benefits.\nClaimants who chose to revert during Pilot Project 20 will continue to have this second option for a period of up to three years (until August 2021).\nThe option to revert to Pilot Project 17 does not apply to claimants in receipt of sickness, maternity, or special benefits for the self-employed, unless they had previously reverted a non-sickness, maternity or self-employment claim. This is because they did not previously have this option on self-employment claims, and therefore would not meet the requirement of having reverted on a claim during the period covered by Pilot Project 20.\nThe default method of treating earnings while on claim applies to self-employment claims, as well as claims where the claimant is outside Canada.\nClaimants who are eligible to choose the alternate option are strongly encouraged to make the choice near the end of their claim in order to have more complete information about their specific circumstances and work pattern. This will make it easier to determine which option would be more beneficial for them. Once the claimant has made their decision to revert a claim, the decision is final and cannot be reversed, regardless of the final impact on the payment of benefits. Decisions made by the Commission regarding requests to revert a claim are not subject or formal reconsideration or appeal.\nEarnings to be deducted from benefits are always rounded to the nearest  dollar. A fraction that is less than one-half is disregarded, and a fraction  equal to or greater than one-half is taken as a dollar. For example, for a benefit  rate of $300, earnings of $82.50 would result in a deduction of $41, reducing  the benefits payable to $259.Detailed information about the working while on claim provisions is  available on the Government of Canada  website.\nIn the context of the Quebec Parental Insurance Program EI maternity or parental benefits are reduced by the amount of any benefits paid or payable under the  provincial plan.\nThus, an amount equal to the amount of QPIP provincial benefits a person  has received or is entitled to receive, will be deducted in full from EI  maternity or parental benefits for which the person may be eligible (EI  Regulation 76.09(2)).\nWhen a claimant is referred to a course or program of instruction or training by the  Commission or a designated authority, earnings or allowances received under  employment benefits (EI Act  19(4)) are not deducted from benefits, except in accordance with the EI  Regulations (EI Regulation 16(1))\nWhen the claimant is attending a course or program of instruction to which they were  not referred, the total of any allowances paid for attending that course are  deducted (EI  Regulation 16(1)). However any allowances paid for dependent care, travel,  commuting, living away from home or disability are not deducted (EI Regulation 16(2)).\nThere will be cases where the claimant attends a training course and is  paid employment benefits (Part II) because they did not have an interruption of  earnings, they didn't qualify for EI benefits (Part I), or because they were  disentitled from benefits. If a claimant in one of these situations subsequently  qualifies for EI benefits for those same weeks, the total of the earnings or  allowances paid under Part II as employment benefits will be deducted from EI  benefits (EI  Regulation 16(3)). For this regulation to apply all three conditions  therein must be present:\n\nthe claimant originally did not have an interruption of earnings or qualify for EI benefits,\nwas paid employment benefits for attending a course or program of instruction or training, and\nsubsequently became entitled to EI benefits for  those same weeks.\n\nEarnings  arising from a job not related to the course or employment activity continue to  be deducted from benefits (EI  Regulations 35 and 36).",0.99774253

Employers are required to complete a ROE for  an insured person when they have an interruption of earnings (EI  Regulation 19(2)). It is usually considered that a claimant who does not  submit their ROE has not proven that an interruption of earnings has occurred. However,  it will be accepted that an interruption of earnings has occurred if the  claimant can show that they have made reasonable efforts to obtain the ROE but the  employer has failed to issue it at the proper time. The timeframes within which  the employer must issue the ROE are outlined in regulation  19(3)(a) and (19)(3.1).\nAn employer may have issued the ROE for the insured person prior to the  end of the seven-day interruption of earnings period. When the Commission  becomes aware, before the benefit period is established, that the claimant has  returned to work for the same employer before the end of the seven day break,  the Commission will not establish a benefit period, as legally, an interruption  of earnings has not occurred.\nHowever, where the Commission becomes aware, after the benefit period  has been established, that the claimant returned to work for the same employer  before the end of the seven day break, the Commission will only reconsider the  decision to establish the benefit period, if there is evidence that the  employer knew the claimant would be returning to work within seven days, when  they issued the ROE.\nThe purpose of this policy is to prevent the voiding of a claim because  there was no interruption of earnings in situations where the employer issued  the ROE believing that the person would be off work for seven or more days, but  was called back unexpectedly.",0.97146094

Such a reduction in hours, and consequently in earnings, does not constitute a lay-off or separation pursuant to the regulation.\nThe initial finding that there was a lay-off or separation from  employment may be later revoked in the case of a claimant who is retroactively reinstated with full pay.\nThere is no cessation of work when a claimant's contract of service  continues, regardless of the amount of compensation received.

92,92,92,"The rules say that if an employee is not working and not getting paid for less than seven days, it doesn't count as a valid break according to the rules. There are exceptions though. For example, if an employer thinks an employee will be off work for seven days or more, they can issue a Record of Employment (ROE) even if the employee comes back to work before that time. Working part-time instead of full-time doesn't count as a break unless there are seven or more straight days without work or pay. Working part-time every week without any breaks also doesn't count as a break, unless there are seven or more days with no work or pay in a row. If someone keeps working on weekends after being laid off from a full-time job, it doesn't count as a break either. 
If an employee works full-time one week and then has no work the next week, it's considered a break in earnings at the end of each week worked. Whether someone in this situation can get benefits is decided based on other laws. If an employee stops getting paid for the off-season but still does some work or gets other benefits that count as earnings, it doesn't count as a break. 
The number of hours worked matters for some parts of the law, such as when someone is eligible for benefits. However, it doesn't determine if there has been a break in earnings. According to the rules, a break in earnings happens when there are seven full days in a row without working and getting paid, from midnight to almost midnight.",77.41044354838712,8.23807347670251,9.2995712137729,11.307168458781362,9.828440860215052,7.43741935483871,39.73745519713262,3.8333333333333335,0.8250953988595442,0.8571366310119629,2.863344569496704,0.7297633138471363,0.4466953443010584,0.0707313201041331,4.168458781362007,4.0,2.0364795307405856,23.25,26.0,8.832940242825904,1.2508960573476702,1.0,0.5369410104416806,279,119,0.4265232974910394,1214,12,2.2.2,Seven day requirement,Chapter 2 - Interruption of earnings,"The seven days without work and without earnings referred to in the  regulations are not fulfilled when the lay-off is intended to be less than  seven calendar days (FCA  A-625-90, CUB  18250, CUB  16277).  As previously mentioned,  there is an exception where an employer issued the ROE based on a  reasonable expectation that the lay-off would be for seven or more days, even  if the claimant returned to work before the seven days (Digest  2.1.3). Work performed for a different employer during the seven-day period  does not prevent the interruption of earnings.\nA change from full-time to part-time employment is not enough to meet  the seven-day requirement (CUB  66921), unless it results in a break of seven or more consecutive days  without work and without earnings. Continuous part-time employment with duties  performed every week will prevent an interruption of earnings (FCA  A-475-05, CUB  72923 CUB  49383), unless of course there is a period of no work or earnings for seven  or more consecutive days . Equally, there is no interruption of earnings in the  case where a claimant continues to work on the weekends for the same employer,  after being laid-off from full-time employment (CUB  66921).\nWhere the part-time employment is such that the employer only hires the  services of a worker for alternate weeks; that is, one week of normal fulltime  work followed by a week of no work, it is considered that an interruption of  earnings occurs at the end of every week worked.  The determination of whether a claimant in  this situation will in fact receive benefits may be considered under other  provisions of the act.\nAn interruption of earnings does not occur where a claimant is no longer  being paid wages for the off-season but nevertheless continues to perform  certain work, or to have the use of living quarters or board  that amount to earnings (FCA  A-307-06, CUB  65896; FCA  A-963-88, CUB  15703,  FCA  A-559-89; CUB  17293).\nThe concept of the number of hours worked is relevant for specific provisions  of the act and regulations, such as insurability, entitlement conditions, and the  number of weeks of benefits payable.  It  is not, however, relevant to determining if an interruption of earnings occurs.

93,93,93,"When someone keeps working without getting paid in cash, benefits, or room and board, the question is whether this is still considered employment. If it's not seen as employment, then there is no interruption in earnings, and the condition requiring seven days without work is not met. 

For example, if a person still uses their employer's truck or continues to work on a farm without pay but with free room and board, they are not considered to have an interruption of earnings. This means they are still viewed as employees even though they are not receiving wages.

If an employer doesn't pay wages due to bankruptcy, an interruption of earnings doesn't happen until there have been seven days without work. In this case, any legal action needed against the employer should be taken through a different law than the Employment Insurance program.

In situations where employees continue to work but without pay, like seasonal employees working unpaid in the off-season or individuals working for family or non-profit organizations without pay, it does not count as an interruption of earnings.

It was concluded that the use of the truck was  linked to the work done by the claimant for the employer (CUB  35521).  In a separate case, it was  ruled that a farmer's son who continued with his usual duties on the farm,  without pay but with free room and board did not have an interruption of  earnings. The absence of the payment of wages in this case did not mean that  the claimant was no longer an employee of his father. The employer-employee  relationship continued while the claimant continued in his work (CUB  61718B, CUB  51153). \nWhen wages have not been paid for days worked as a result of an employer  declaring bankruptcy, no interruption of earnings occurs until there is a  period of seven days without work (CUB  19081). Whatever recourse an individual may have in such a situation must  be sought under legislation other than the EI program (Provincial Employment  Standards Act).\nAn interruption of earnings was considered not to have occurred in a situation where, in order for a seasonal  employee to be recalled in the active season, one of the conditions was to  occasionally work without pay during the off-season (CUB  14230A).  Other situations where it  was found an interruption of earnings did not occur include a grandmother who  continued to provide the same level of day care to her grandchild, while no longer  being paid  (FCA  A-475-05, CUB  64220); a claimant who was laid off but continued to work for her husband  for approximately ten hours a week, without pay (CUB  49383), and a claimant who worked for a non-profit organization for which  he was paid, then continued to work 35 hours per week, without pay, when the  organization could no longer support his salary (CUB  47937). \nGenerally, employees must work to earn their wages.  Regardless of whether they may at some point,  no longer receive wages while continuing to perform the same work, they are  still considered to be working. There is no stoppage of work, and therefore no  interruption of earnings, when a contract of service continues, even if it is for  little or no pay. These workers continue to provide the same services as had  been provided when receiving full wages, therefore cannot prove an interruption  of earnings (FCA  A-559-89).",0.9970208

In these cases, an  interruption of earnings occurs at the beginning of the week in which the  claimant's earnings are reduced by more than 40% of their normal weekly  earnings (EIR  14(2)).\nIn this context, the normal weekly earnings are calculated on the basis  of the regular hourly rate multiplied by the regular hours worked in a week, or  an individual's weekly salary, including overtime worked on a regular basis.

98,98,98,"In some jobs, workers might have schedules different from the typical 9-5 workweek, like in remote mines, offshore drilling platforms, or ships. Some workplaces run non-stop, so employees might work for many days in a row and then have time off. The time off is determined by how many hours or days they have worked. There are two ways this time off can be determined: either by earning credits based on work hours, or by following a set schedule of work and rest. This time off is still considered part of their job, even if they're not getting paid during this period. However, if someone stops working or leaves the job, how this time off is handled might change.

If someone accrues time off based on how much they work, when they stop working or leave, it needs to be checked if they can use up this accrued time off. If they can, then their official time off only starts after using all of this accrued time. If they had a break in their work before, they might still have benefits available. But if their work stops and they lose the accrued time off, their official break from work starts right then.

Some examples where this type of work schedule could occur would be  isolated work mines or sites, ocean platform drilling rigs or vessels on the  St. Lawrence or Great Lakes, or along the Pacific and Atlantic coasts.\nMany other workplaces whose operations are continuous may also adopt  similar uninterrupted work patterns. Quite often in these cases employees will  work for 4, 5, 6, or 7 continuous days, following which they have a period of  leave. Another pattern of work that is common is one that allows the employee  to work more hours in a week according to a schedule, and consequently accumulate  a period of leave within an established calendar period.\nSpecific provisions in the contract of employment or the collective  agreement will generally provide the method pursuant to which the period of  leave will be determined. There are two basic methods for determining the  period of leave: one is based on a credit system whereby credits are earned and  accumulated based on the number of hours or days worked, while the other method  is based on an established schedule alternating periods of work and leave.  Whichever method is used, this period of leave does not constitute an  interruption of earnings regardless of whether the period is remunerated (EI  Regulation 14(3); EI Act  11(4)). However should a stoppage of activities occur or if the employee is  laid off or separates from employment, the manner in which the period of leave  is treated may be different.\n\nCredits earned and accumulated based on number of hours or days worked\nWith respect to the accumulated leave credit system, what needs to be  determined when a stoppage of activities or a lay-off or separation occurs is  whether, according to the contract of employment or collective agreement, the  insured person has a right to use up the lay days or accumulated leave credits.  If such is the case, then the interruption of earnings would only occur after all  of the lay days are used up and the period of leave covered by  such accumulated lay days, ends (FCA A-708-92, CUB 20866; FCA A-100-89, CUB 16027; FCA A-762-90, CUB 16027A).\nWhere a person works this type of schedule, a benefit period may be  established if they had a previous interruption of earnings in their qualifying  period.  However, they would not be  considered unemployed in any week in which the period of accumulated leave  falls. Additional information on lay days and other periods of leave can be  found in section  4.3.5 of this digest.\nHowever, if the collective agreement or the employment contract  stipulates that the claimant loses those lay days or accumulated leave credits when  the employment or employer's activities stop, the interruption of earnings  occurs at the end of the employment, as there is no longer any entitlement to a  period of leave (FCA  A-220-87, CUB  13443).  Where the claimant is still entitled  to be paid for the lay days, the allocation of earnings would prevent an  interruption of earnings (EI Regulation 36(9)). It is important to keep in mind  that, as the claimant is not entitled to an actual leave period for the lay  days, the provisions of EI Act 11(4) do not come into play. Therefore, a  disentitlement for failing to prove the claimant is unemployed, would not  apply.\n\n\nEstablished schedule alternating periods of work and leave\nWith regard to the pattern of alternating period of work and leave, it  is considered that the established work schedule is interrupted during any  period where the employer's activities are stopped, or when the employment  relationship ends. An interruption of earnings therefore occurs in these  situations, provided that, during the week the activities stop, the employee had  not used any accumulated lay days prior to stopping work.

- Five weeks from when you last sent an update for your previous claim
- Four weeks from when the final update for your previous claim was processed

Even if you don't need to prove when your job stopped for a renewal claim, you still have 4 weeks from then to renew your application without needing permission to apply late.

This means a claimant has 4 weeks following the week they stopped working to submit their renewal application without having to request an antedate.\nIn all cases, for an initial claim, renewal claim, or subsequent claim, a claimant who applies after the 4-calendar-week timeframe must request an antedate if they would like their BP to start at an earlier date.

139,139,139,"When someone has their pay interrupted and a benefit period starts, the question is if they are considered unemployed. This happens when they don't work for a period of time. In some jobs, people work more hours or days than normal full-time workers. For example, workers in remote places like mines, ocean drilling platforms, or processing plants sometimes work many days in a row before getting days off. Some workers also have a schedule where they work extra hours for a certain time, then get time off to make up for it, called lay days.

If workers have these kinds of schedules, they're usually not seen as unemployed during their time off, according to employment laws. There are two main ways to determine how this time off is planned - one is based on credits earned from working, and the other is based on a set schedule of work and time off. If a worker puts in more hours than a normal full-time worker and has a right to time off, they're not seen as unemployed during that time off.

It's important to note that what counts as full-time work isn't clearly defined in the law. It depends on each case and local labor laws. If a worker gets time off to compensate for extra work hours, they're not considered unemployed during that time off. But there must be proof of an agreement with the employer for this time off - it can't be assumed. If there's no agreement, the worker might be seen as unemployed.

When an employer stops activities or lays off a worker, the worker might be considered unemployed. It depends on whether there's an agreement for time off that remains valid after the job ends. If the agreement says the worker loses their time off when the job ends, they're considered unemployed right away. When a worker has a regular schedule of working and then taking time off, the time off isn't seen as unemployment as long as it falls within their regular schedule.

To keep receiving benefits, workers must prove they're ready and able to work by actively looking for a job. This rule applies to all workers, even those with alternating schedules. They need to show they're available for work during their time off and actively seeking jobs.",77.26548650385605,7.314266066838048,9.120678840339163,10.042210796915167,9.023843187660669,8.55619537275064,37.70192802056555,3.55,0.8519132701974166,0.8331063522232903,2.7615296920677865,0.5714106224442317,0.4826595280559209,0.0706084359856879,4.401028277634961,4.0,2.2739384023786133,19.45,19.0,6.953236656406856,1.2982005141388175,1.0,0.5943364673320694,389,163,0.4190231362467866,1791,20,4.3.5,Lay days or periods of leave,Chapter 4 - Week of unemployment,"When a person has had an interruption of earnings (Digest 2.3.2) and a benefit period is established, the question that arises is whether the person is considered unemployed; that is, is the week(s) in which the claimant does not work, considered a week of unemployment.\nIn some workplaces, employees will regularly work more hours, days or shifts than what other individuals who work full-time elsewhere, normally work in a week. This could include workers in isolated worksites such as mines or sites, ocean platform drilling rigs and vessels on the St. Lawrence or Great Lakes, or work in various processing plants. \nOther workplaces whose operations are continuous may also have similar uninterrupted work patterns. Quite often in these cases employees will have a work pattern where they work for 6, 7 or more continuous days, followed by the same number of days off.\nAnother pattern of work that is common is one in which the employee, according to a schedule with their employer, works more hours in a week than is normally considered full-time employment, and accumulates a period of leave to compensate for the extra hours worked within an established calendar period. The days covering the period of leave are often referred to as lay days.\nGenerally, employees who have these types of work patterns would not be considered unemployed during the period of lay days, for the purposes of the EI Act. Even if specific provisions under a verbal or written agreement of employment, or a collective agreement, provide the method pursuant to which the period of leave is determined, these agreements do not supersede the Act.\r\n        There are 2 basic methods for determining the period of leave: one is based on a credit system whereby credits are earned and accumulated based on the number of hours or days worked, while the other method is based on an established schedule of alternating periods of work and leave, during a period of employment.\nThe EI Act stipulates that, where, in each week, an insured person works a greater number of hours, days, or shifts, than are normally worked in a week by a person employed in full-time employment, and is entitled to a period of leave, pursuant to an employment agreement, the claimant shall be deemed to have worked a full working week during each week that falls wholly or partly, in the period of leave (EIA 11(4); EIR 14(3)).\nThere is no formal definition of full-time employment in the EI Act or regulations. What constitutes full-time employment is a factual determination that should be based on evidence. On a case-by-case basis, a review of local labour market information and terms of the Employment Standards Act in the claimant's province or territory of employment should be reviewed to assist with the determination of what constitutes the number of hours normally worked in a week by persons employed in full-time employment.\nWhen the claimant works more hours or days than normal and is entitled to a period of leave to compensate for the additional work, the claimant is considered not unemployed during any week which the period of compensatory leave falls. When making this determination, the first condition relates to the number of hours of work itself, and the second condition relates to whether there is an entitlement to a period of leave under a verbal or written agreement, or an employment contract.\nIt cannot be presumed based on an individual's work pattern, that an agreement with the employer providing for a period of leave exists; the file must contain evidence that an agreement (verbal or written) providing for the entitlement of lay days or a period of leave, exists. A decision to consider that a person is not unemployed for the above reasons must be based, as any other decision, on tangible evidence.\nWhen there is no such agreement or the collective agreement or contract of employment does not refer to lay days or to a period of leave for working a greater number of hours, days or shifts than are normally worked, it will be concluded there is a termination of employment at the end of each period worked. Claimants in this situation would be treated in the same manner as any other claimant who works long hours, is paid accordingly, and are therefore, considered to be unemployed. Standard availability rules apply.\nWith respect to the accumulated days of leave, what must be determined when an employer's activities cease or a lay-off or separation occurs is whether, according to the verbal or written contract of employment or collective agreement, the insured person has a right to use up the lay days or accumulated leave credits. If this is the case, then that person can only be considered unemployed after the expiration of the period of leave, the lay days or accumulated leave credits (Jurisprudence Index/interruption of earnings/compensatory leave/; FCA A-708-92, CUB 20866).\nHowever, if the collective agreement or the verbal or written employment contract stipulates that the claimant loses those lay days or accumulated leave credits when their employment terminates, or when the employer's activities cease, the claimant is considered unemployed from the time the employment stops.  This is because there is no longer an entitlement to a period of leave (FCA A-58-06, CUB 65103). In this case, the issue may be one of allocation of earnings if the claimant is paid for the accumulated lay days (EIR 36(9)).\nA claimant may have a regular pattern of alternating periods where they work a higher number of hours or days than normal, which is followed by a period of leave. In this situation, the week in which the lay days or period of leave falls, cannot be considered a week of unemployment when it falls within a period covered by the alternating work and off work schedule (FCA A-92-03, CUB 56090A; CUB 52217A; Jurisprudence Index/interruption of earnings/compensatory leave/). However, if in a week, the lay days or period of leave falls after the employer's activities stop, the claimant will be considered unemployed as of that week. In fact, it is considered that the established schedule of alternate periods of work and leave is interrupted for the duration of the period when the employer's activities are stopped, provided that, during that week, the individual had not used any lay days or accumulated leave days, prior to the stoppage of the employer's activities.\nWhen or if the employer's operations resume it may be difficult to determine whether or not the claimant remains unemployed now that the schedule of work has been reactivated. Whether the effective first day of work is at the beginning of the week or later in the week, if it is followed by a period of leave in that week, the claimant will be considered not unemployed for the entire week. Otherwise, the issue will be one of allocation of earnings (EIR 36(4)). As well, the claimant will be subject to all of the requirements for proving availability for work.\nIn a scenario where there is a set pattern of work and the employee does not work more hours in a week, than would be considered normal (40 hours; 5 days, followed by a week off), the determination of whether the week off is considered a week of unemployment requires careful consideration.\nThe issue of a claimant's availability for work must also be considered. The EI Act requires that claimants be capable of and available for suitable employment while in receipt of EI regular benefits. Entitlement to benefits does not rely solely on the fact that one is available for work but rather on their proving it. Claimants must prove that, for each day they request payment of regular benefits, they are available for and actively seeking employment and are not placing undue restrictions on their availability.\nThese principles apply equally to claimants who work a pattern of alternating weeks of normal hours and weeks off. Those claimants must continue to be willing to seek and accept suitable work during their off weeks. They must also be able to provide a record of their job search efforts for any week for which benefits are claimed, when requested by the Commission, as with any other claimant.",0.952778

This presumption is not overcome merely by statements from both parties that no remuneration in any form is being paid in return for the services (FCA A-427-99, CUB 44889; A-274-95; CUB 27230). It is unusual for a person to work a full working week for a profit-making business, without any remuneration of any type.\nThe amount of remuneration is a matter entirely between the employer and the employee, which should not concern the Commission. The remuneration that should or should not be paid for services provided is governed by provincial or federal labour legislation. For EI benefit purposes, the claimant's decision to work a full working week for only a few dollars, for a commission to be paid several months later, or for non-monetary considerations such as room and board, is irrelevant (FCA A-477-00, CUB 45675; Jurisprudence Index/week of unemployment/benevolent work/). Even in cases where no remuneration is paid, one may be considered as working, if there is a relationship that may be likened to or regarded in the same way as a contract of service, between the person performing the work, and the person benefiting from it (FCA A-105-98, CUB 39928; FCA A-245-97; CUB 36921).\nAs an exception to the above, in a case where the claimant offered services to an employer at no charge with a view to proving competence and obtaining employment, it was held that such efforts were more in the nature of a job search than employment itself (Jurisprudence Index/availability for work/various activities/volunteer work/).",0.949125

This is true even if they are not being paid during the training period or if they are paid less than they would be for the actual job.

However, if the person is not officially employed during the training, then those weeks are considered weeks of unemployment. But, it's also important to think about whether the person is available for work while they are in the training.

153,153,153,"This information is about determining if someone who provides services to their parents or family members should be classified as an employee or not. If the person doesn't get paid for the services, it's important to figure out if they are doing it out of a sense of duty or if it's like an employer-employee relationship where they get some benefits other than money. If there is no payment involved, it usually means there's no work contract, so the services provided to a family member might not be considered as employment. To help decide this, some questions can be asked:

- Do the person's parents/family run a business or a farm?
- Are the services by the person related to the business or farm? If there is no business or farm, is the work done something that would usually need an expert?
- Does the person get any kind of gain, either money or non-money, other than what they had before giving the services? Do the services and gains go beyond what family members normally share? Did the person get free room and board before, and who did the work at that time?
- Are the services similar to those provided to a business for payment? Are they done during regular work hours, evenings, weekends, or the person's free time? Would the parents need to hire someone if the person stopped working for them?
- Does the work take up more time than looking for a job elsewhere? Is the person busy during the best times to search for a job? Could the person continue this work while having another full-time job? If not, is the person willing to quit?

These questions are used to check the information given by those involved. If it's confirmed that the person doesn't get paid at all, it means the services are not part of a work contract and the person is considered unemployed, no matter the situation. The focus will then be on the person's readiness to work.

These questions can be adjusted slightly for other similar situations, like if the person is a parent doing work for their child, or if the person is assisting a friend in a big project. If it's determined that the services are like a job, the next step is to find out if the person works a full week. This depends on if the person's work hours are decided by the employer. If it's found that the person doesn't work a full week, a deduction might be made from the benefits they receive.

If someone took care of a neighbor's baby at home along with their own children for pay, it was not considered employment. It's important for the person to prove each week they're claiming benefits is truly a week of unemployment, and they must also show they are ready to work each day that week. If the person seems more focused on an activity than on finding a job, it could raise doubts about their availability for work.

The absence of remuneration of any type whatsoever generally indicates that there is no contract of service, in which case the services given to a member of the family may not amount to employment (Jurisprudence Index/week of unemployment/friends or relatives/; FCA A-986-88; CUB 15699). The following questions may help to clarify the facts in a particular case:\nDo the claimant's parents/family member operate a business or a farm?\nAre the services that are provided by the claimant, connected with the operation of the business or the farm? If no business or farm is involved, has the claimant undertaken substantial work that could normally have been performed only by qualified people?\nDoes the claimant receive any monetary or non-monetary gain, other than that received before rendering the services? Do the services performed and the gains received exceed those that are commonly shared among members of the same family? Was the claimant previously given room and board free of charge? Who did the work at that time?\nAre the services given in the nature of those generally provided to a business for remuneration? Are they carried out during the normal hours of work, in the evening, during weekends or in the claimant's leisure time? Would the parents have to hire someone to do the work should the claimant quit or otherwise decide not to continue?\nDoes the claimant devote more time to this activity than to seeking employment elsewhere? Is the claimant kept busy during the hours that are most favourable for a job search? Could this activity be continued while accepting full-time employment elsewhere? If not, is the claimant willing to quit?\nThe above questions are used to verify the accuracy of the information provided by the interested parties. If it is established that there is no remuneration of any type paid to the claimant, cash or otherwise, it will be concluded that the services are not performed under a contract of service and that the claimant is unemployed, regardless of the situation. The availability for work will be the only question that has to be examined.\nWith slight modifications, these questions can be adapted to other similar circumstances, for example in reverse situations where the claimant is a parent who has undertaken some work on behalf of a daughter or son, or the claimant helps a friend engaged in substantial activities.\nOnce it has been determined that the services performed are in the nature of employment, the next question to consider is whether the claimant works a full working week. To this end, reference should be made to the general rules applicable depending on whether the claimant's hours of work are controlled by the employer (Digest 4.5.1). If it is determined that the claimant does not work a full working week, an assessment of the non-monetary considerations will be made, which will result in the applicable deduction from the weekly EI benefits payable.\nIn a case where the claimant, in return for a monetary consideration, looked after a neighbour's baby at home, along with her own children, it was held that this was not employment (Digest 4.1.3).\nIt must be kept in mind that the claimant has the onus of proving that any week for which benefits are being claimed is a week of unemployment (Digest 4.2.0). In addition, the claimant's availability for work must be proven with respect to each working day of that week (Digest 10.2.0). Whether or not the activity being considered constitutes employment, where the actions of a claimant show more concern for the activity than for seeking employment, this is evidence that their availability may be in question (Digest 10.14.0). A claimant may be able to prove they are unemployed within the meaning of the Act, however they must also prove their availability for work (Jurisprudence Index/week of unemployment/work without earnings/).",0.966948

The first situation is when your spouse has a contract with someone else. For example, you might help your spouse clean buildings or do other work as part of their contract. In this case, even if you help out, only your spouse is officially employed. If both you and your spouse are mentioned in the contract, then you both count as employed.

Now, there's an exception to this rule. If your spouse can't do all the work in the contract for a valid reason like being sick or away from home, you might be considered employed too and receive some of the earnings. Just keep in mind that any money you receive for helping out should be considered as income for you.

A typical scenario would be helping one's spouse in cleaning buildings at night or doing janitorial/superintendent work where both spouses live. No matter what the arrangement and how many hours each spouse devotes to the fulfillment of the contract, it is considered that the only one employed is the individual bound under the contract. Consequently, all earnings arising out of the contract are considered to belong to the claimant's spouse, and the question to consider is the availability of the claimant. Of course, if the claimant's spouse who is responsible for fulfilling the contract has also made a claim for benefits, the general rules would apply based on whether the claimant's spouse controls their own working hours. The two spouses will be considered employed only if the contractual relationship applies to both of them (FCA A-464-90; CUB 17990).\nAs an exception to the above, where it is clearly shown that, for some reason, the spouse is unable to perform all the tasks required under the contract, the claimant may be considered as employed and in receipt of part of the earnings arising out of the contract. For example, this may be by reason of a spouse's temporary incapacity, prolonged absence from home, physical limitations or because the tasks require the services of more than one person (FCA A-904-96; CUB 35351). In these cases, it is considered that any earnings from the contract that are paid to the claimant for their assistance, are expenses incurred by the spouse with the contract. These expenses are for the direct purpose of earning the income (EIR 35(10)), and such expenses will constitute earnings by the claimant, in return for the assistance given. When the time comes to determine whether the claimant works a full working week, the general rules as to whether a person controls their own working hours will be applied. For any week found to be a week of unemployment, the claimant's earnings in cash or in kind must be taken into account. Should the amount disclosed as being the claimant's wages appear unrealistic, the Commission will make an assessment, based on what would be reasonable under the circumstances (EIR 35(12)).\nAs for the second scenario, consideration will be given to the nature of the duties and responsibilities carried out by each one in the operation of the business (Digest 4.6.7.4; Digest 4.6.9). A determination will then be made regarding the employment status, earnings, and availability for other work, for each claimant.",0.9773089

The important thing to consider is whether you are available for other types of work.
If you work for a business or someone without pay, it doesn't always mean it's volunteer work. If you are working for free because you expect to get something in return later, like a job, then you might not be considered unemployed.

The absence of such contract is a decisive factor as far as entitlement to unemployment benefits is concerned.\nTherefore, in the absence of a contract of service, a claimant who provides services as a benevolent gesture is considered not to be involved in employment. This is true even if, in some instances, the services may be provided on a full-time basis, or the claimant may receive certain benefits, such as room and board, by living on the premises (Jurisprudence Index/week of unemployment/benevolent work/). The real question to examine under the circumstances is the claimant's availability for other work (Digest 10.14.1).\nProviding work to a business or employer without remuneration does not necessarily mean an individual is performing benevolent work.  In some cases, if the work is being done in anticipation of benefiting from it at a later date, such as creating future employment for the worker, there is a strong presumption that the worker is not unemployed (FCA A-427-99; CUB 44889). In one case, a claimant who devoted considerable time to the two businesses that his wife operated from the basement of the family home was held to be not unemployed. He did not prove that he would not derive any economic benefit from this activity whereas, to be authentic, volunteered work implies such a non-interest (FCA A-771-88, CUB 15420; Digest 4.6.7.4; Digest 4.6.9).",0.969043

If you're self-employed and you've worked a certain number of hours in another job that qualifies, you might be able to get benefits. However, if you're self-employed and working a lot, you are not considered unemployed and usually cannot get these benefits.

As such, self-employed persons generally are not covered under the Employment Insurance program (EIA 7; EIR 2, 3, 4; EIR 5, 6; EIR 7,8; EIR 9). The legislation is designed to provide temporary benefits to those who are unemployed and actively seeking work. It cannot be used to subsidize persons who are self-employed or engaged in the operation of a business, unless under an authorized employment activity (EIA 59(c); EIR 50; Digest 4.6.12), or under the Employment Insurance Fishing Regulations. Self-employed persons may qualify for benefits if they have accumulated the required number of hours of insurable employment from other employment. A claimant may commence self-employment activities while on claim, but must continue to meet all other entitlement conditions to receive benefits.\nOnce a self-employed person meets the qualifying conditions to establish a claim for benefits, in order to be entitled to receive benefits, they must demonstrate that they are unemployed for each week claimed. A person is unemployed if they do not work a full working week. Generally, a self-employed person is regarded as working a full working week, and therefore is not unemployed (EIR 30(1)). However, when the self-employment activity is so minor in extent that a person would not normally rely upon it as a principal means of livelihood, the claimant may be regarded as not working a full working week (EIR 30(2); 30(3); Digest 4.6.4). When this test is met, and all entitlement conditions for the type of benefits claimed are also met, they would be entitled to EI benefits as with any other claimant. Any earnings from the self-employment activities must be  considered and may reduce the amount of benefits payable (EIR 35; Digest 5.16.0).\nPart VII.1 of the EI Act provides for the payment of special benefits to self-employed persons.  Special benefits include sickness, maternity, parental, compassionate care and family caregiver benefits.  Qualifying and entitlement conditions for self-employed persons to receive these types of benefits are discussed in detail in Chapter 24 of this Digest.\nBecause of the uniqueness of farming, special considerations apply when determining if a disentitlement applies for a full working week during the period that begins with the week in which October 1st falls, and ends with the week in which the following March 31st falls (EIR 30(4); Digest 4.6.5.1).

If that is the case, there is no presumption that they work a full working week.\nTo determine whether these claimants' employment-related activities are minor in extent, their employment is compared with others who normally rely on similar employment as their principal means of livelihood.

This helps with issues like getting an overall picture of the situation, checking if the person is telling the truth about how much they work, understanding what their job involves, and seeing if they meet the requirements in rule EIR 30(2).

If someone's work isn't a big part of their life, they're seen as being unemployed. But if it's a big part, they can't get benefits because they're considered to be working full-time. Financial statements, like income and balance sheets, can give details about someone's business involvement. For example, no salary on the statement might mean the person runs the business by themselves, while high rent or utility bills could show they have a physical store or office. These statements also help understand the factors in rule EIR 30(3), like how much money has been put in, and if the business is making enough profit.

Deciding if someone is unemployed is unique to each person, considering their individual circumstances. It's important to look at all six factors to make a fair decision. Some factors might be more important in different situations. But it is crucial to thoroughly explain how each of the six factors was considered to back up the decision made by the Commission.",72.10171052631581,8.934172932330831,10.608840637214634,12.200707651481649,11.541318000884566,9.677399380804951,45.3624502432552,5.142857142857143,0.7973722494565524,0.828035960594813,3.078419671037907,0.867155997830412,0.4364446524302486,0.0575117602804991,4.5510835913312695,4.0,2.5204471080725805,23.071428571428573,16.5,15.134937282017797,1.3157894736842106,1.0,0.6338966760650732,323,167,0.5170278637770898,1542,14,4.6.4.1,Factors determining whether a claimant's involvement is minor in extent,Chapter 4 - Week of unemployment,"The 6 factors to be considered in determining whether the claimant is employed or engaged in the operation of a business to such a minor extent they would not rely on that employment or engagement as a principal means of livelihood are the:\n\ntime spent\nnature and amount of the capital and resources invested\nfinancial success or failure of the employment or business\ncontinuity of the employment or business\nnature of the employment or business, and\nclaimant's intention and willingness to seek and immediately accept alternate employment\n\nThese 6 factors are stated in the text of EIR 30(3). This regulatory provision specifies that the extent of claimants' participation in self-employment, in the operation of a business, or in any other employment in which they control their working hours, should be judged in light of numerous factors rather than solely on the amount of time spent on that activity. Jurisprudence stressing consideration of all 6 circumstances should be used to support decisions under the present regulation (FCA A-418-97, CUB 35899; FCA A-58-94, CUB 23879; FCA A-614-94, CUB 25617).\nAll of these factors must be considered in order to:\n\nobtain an overview of the situation\nassess the claimant's credibility with regard to the hours spent on the employment or business\ndefine their role and responsibilities with regard to participation in that employment or engagement, and\ndetermine whether the relieving conditions set forth in EIR 30(2) have been met\n\nIf the claimant's employment-related activities are minor in extent, the claimant is considered not to have worked a full working week and therefore is unemployed. If the claimant's employment-related activities are more than minor in extent, the claimant is disentitled from benefits because they are working a full working week and therefore not unemployed.\nFinancial statements can assist in fact finding as they may provide information on the extent of the claimant's involvement in the business. In practical terms:\n\nif a quick check of the income statement reveals no salaries, this may mean the claimant is operating the business on their own, without assistance\nIf there are automobile, gasoline and travel expenses, this may indicate the claimant travels for the business\nhigh rent, heat, and hydro expenses may indicate occupancy of a store or office, presupposing a considerable financial expenditure and the claimant's intention to work on their own account\n\nFinancial statements can also provide information about the circumstances to be considered under EIR 30(3):\n\nthe balance sheet can show the moneys invested: the equipment owned by the business and its value, owners' equity, and debt-load, as well as continuity of the business: assets and liabilities\nthe income statement can show financial success or failure in that it sets out profit or loss for a specific period\n\nThe question of unemployment must be considered on an individual basis, since each person's situation is different, and must be examined in light of these differences. Each of the 6 factors must be taken into account. Examination of the 6 factors may reveal that some of them do not necessarily apply in all cases, since some are more relevant than others in different situations. Nonetheless, the result of the examination of the 6 factors must be fully documented in order to support the Commission's decision.",0.82265425
164,164,164,"The time you spend on work is important to decide if your activities are considered minor. When looking at your efforts to start or continue a business where you control your hours, we also think about when you work during the day or week. If you spend more time on your activities, they're more likely to be seen as a major part of what you do. If you work as much as you would in a regular workweek, especially on a strict schedule, it suggests your activities are not minor. But if you spend less time and can be more flexible about when you work, like weekends or evenings, then your activities might be minor. We compare how much time you put into your work against someone who does similar work full-time to figure out if your work is more like a side project.

We also consider what's normal for the type of work you do and when people typically do it. Even if you work during the day, evening, or night, if it's a job that people usually do at different times, we look at how you compare to those who do the same work full-time. Just because your work slows down at times or is seasonal doesn't automatically mean it's minor. We look at what you intend to do during those slow times to see if the work is still a main focus or just a side job. Some jobs are only busy for part of the year, and if you work full-time during the busy season but not at all when it's slow, we might still consider it your main source of income.",78.5722077922078,8.623701298701299,9.339509955726095,12.03896103896104,10.103629870129868,6.515142857142855,37.59740259740259,3.090909090909091,0.8989331901073456,0.8979537950621711,2.961546075596763,0.5345265929555822,0.4404606475859724,0.0485452641385363,3.992857142857143,4.0,2.010673052101952,25.454545454545453,25.0,6.959148803274414,1.2107142857142856,1.0,0.5229308105792402,280,121,0.4321428571428571,1158,11,4.6.4.2,Time spent,Chapter 4 - Week of unemployment,"The time spent is an important consideration, but it is not the only one applied to determine whether the claimant's activities are minor in extent. All types of efforts made by claimants to set up or continue their business or other employment in which they control their working hours, must be examined. The time of day or week that claimants devote to their business or other employment is also an important element to consider. Of course, the more time a person spends on activities, the greater the likelihood that they will be considered to be engaged to more than a minor extent.\nThe fact that a claimant spends an amount of time on activities for approximately the same duration as a regular working week, may demonstrate that the activities are not minor in extent. This is particularly relevant if the person is obligated to keep a relatively strict schedule (EIR 30(2); CUB 37086; CUB 32849; FCA A-699-02; CUB 53297A). For example, the less time spent and the more flexible the hours, weekends or evenings, the greater possibility the activities are minor in extent. When the number of hours devoted to the activity is less than the number spent by someone following a similar activity as a principal means of livelihood, the conclusion that the claimant's engagement is more in the nature of a sideline may be supported.\nNormal labour market conditions with respect to the self-employment activity or other employment in which claimants control their working hours must be considered. Whether the claimant works at it during the day, in the evenings or at night is irrelevant if it is an activity which people normally carry out at any time, as a principal means of livelihood. The claimant's time spent must be compared against those following that type of employment as a principal means of livelihood (FCA A-113-97; CUB 36744).\nSlow periods or seasonal fluctuations do not automatically make the self-employment activity or other employment in which claimants control their working hours, minor in extent. A person's intentions during the period in question are often a good indicator of the claimant's unemployed status. The fact-finding should determine if the claimant is merely going through a slow period and if the activity is now a sideline, or if it is still a principal means of livelihood. Numerous businesses are seasonal in nature, so that the activities required of them cease during part of the year, or the tasks to be performed become substantially less. Claimants who pursue a seasonal activity may establish that they are working full working weeks during the on-season and are unemployed during the period in which the business ceases its activities (Digest  4.6.4.5).",0.99861944
165,165,165,"The more money someone puts into a business, the more likely it is that they intend for that business to be their main way of making a living. When a person invests nearly all they have in a business, it shows that they want it to be a successful and long-lasting venture.

There are certain signs that can help determine if someone sees their business as their main source of income, such as the amount of money and resources put in, what they buy for the business, changes made to the location where the business will operate, or if they sign a lease for the business location.

It's important to figure out if the money and resources put into the business are typical for making a business profitable enough to be the main source of income. The contributions to a business can vary, like bringing in property, money, skills, contracts, or work instead of just money.

If a business starts doing poorly or runs into money troubles, the owner might indicate that they no longer plan to rely on that business as their main income source. In such cases, the efforts made to save the business can show if the person's statements are believable. For instance, if someone invests a lot of money to try to revive the business, it might be harder to believe that they no longer see it as their main source of livelihood.",67.08551089211619,11.386135892116185,10.125756701596842,14.041701244813275,14.211877593360995,8.908879668049789,49.21213692946058,5.75,0.9062916466167996,0.9295386970043182,3.0920902563918227,0.6776631553248534,0.4695920562281352,0.0563296934252243,4.369294605809128,4.0,2.299316856947537,30.125,28.5,10.78700027811254,1.2904564315352698,1.0,0.5676918755180267,241,108,0.4481327800829875,1081,8,4.6.4.3,Nature and amount of the capital and resources invested,Chapter 4 - Week of unemployment,"The larger the financial commitment to an enterprise, the more likely it is that the business is intended to be or become the claimant's principal means of livelihood. Claimants who put practically everything they have into the endeavour reflect their intention at that time to make it a permanent, viable business (CUB 34019; Jurisprudence Index/week of unemployment/business/).\nIndicators of whether or not claimants intend to make the endeavour a principal means of livelihood include but are not limited to:\n\nthe capital and resources invested, material or equipment purchased, conversion of premises when the business is set up, or signing of a personal lease for the premises where the business is located (CUB 27866; CUB 24574)\ndebt-load and line of credit, or moneys or salary from the business reinvested to ensure its continuity\n\nIt must be determined whether the moneys and securities involved are those which are normally invested to make such an endeavour profitable to the extent that it will become a person's principal means of livelihood, or alternatively whether they are normally expended for an occupation which is clearly secondary in nature.\nThe person's contribution will not always be in the form of a monetary contribution. When persons enter into a business, the contribution of each of the participants may or may not constitute a capital outlay. Such contributions can be very different: real or personal property, credit or money, skill, experience, contracts, reputation or work.\nWhen the business experiences a major decline or finds itself in financial difficulties, claimants may indicate that they no longer intend to operate the business as a principal means of livelihood. The financial commitment and the efforts made to save the business can test the credibility of a claimant's statement regarding a change in intentions. For example, substantial amounts invested to revive the business may diminish the credibility of such a statement.",0.9692463
166,166,166,"The financial success or failure of a business or job where someone controls their hours can impact their benefits. Doing well in the business or job shows that they're putting in the right effort. But not making money doesn't mean they're not working enough. Even if the profits are low, it doesn't mean the business or job isn't their main source of income.

How much money they make from the business or job matters when they're working a lot and it shows how big their work is. Sometimes, people put all their money back into the business to help it grow instead of paying themselves a salary. Not making enough money doesn't mean they're not working enough. It's normal for new businesses to not make a lot of profit at first.

Money isn't the only important thing to consider when someone is fully committed to their business or job. If they want it to be their main job, the amount of money they make doesn't matter that much. 

If sales go up and down, it doesn't automatically mean they can get benefits. If the business faces a big drop in sales or might go bankrupt, the person might change their plans. They might decide to work harder on the business or start looking for a different job. In that case, they can ask for a review of their situation.

The success of the business or the other employment is certainly a factor that strengthens the presumption that the claimant devoted the necessary time and effort to the endeavour. Conversely, failure to derive a return from the business or the other employment does not necessarily mean the claimant's activities are minor in extent. Nor can it be said that because profits are not satisfactory to the claimant, the business or the other employment is not the claimant's principal means of livelihood.\nThe gross income derived from the business or other employment may constitute an important factor when a significant number of hours are being worked, and when it accurately reflects the size of the endeavour. It may serve to indicate whether or not the claimant's activities are minor in extent.\nSome claimants may reinvest all or most of their returns back into the business to strengthen it, instead of drawing a salary, then claim their involvement to be a simple investment because the business is not yet generating sufficient returns to pay their salary (Digest 4.6.3.2). The lack of financial success of a claimant's endeavours does not prove that they are engaged in self-employment activities to a minor extent. Low profit levels are very common for a new business.\nFinancial return is not a decisive factor, and has no importance when claimants are engaged full time in setting up or ensuring the continuity of their business or their other employment. When claimants intend to make the business or the other employment their sole occupation or their principal means of livelihood, the amount of money derived from those activities is not an essential factor to consider in determining whether they are engaged in their employment to a minor extent (FCA A-699-02, CUB 53297).\nFluctuating sales levels are also not sufficient to establish the right to benefits. If the conditions of the business change, leading to a sufficiently large drop in sales or to the possibility of the business being forced into bankruptcy, the claimant's intentions may change as well. Facing a bankruptcy may cause the claimant to either devote more time to the business, or to devote much less time to running the business and more to actively looking for other employment. Such facts might lead the claimant to request a reconsideration of their situation. The agent will take into account the claimant's new intentions in conjunction with the circumstances mentioned in EIR 30(3), to decide whether the claimant is still working a full working week while operating the business.",0.9911136
167,167,167,"The way in which a business is continued or if people are working in jobs where they can decide when to work, is important because it shows what the people intend and the true nature of their involvement in these work-related activities. If a business keeps running while people are getting benefits, it matters because it could mean that the business is serious enough to need more than just a little interest from the person getting benefits.

It's also important to think about how active the business is. Is it busier now, slower, or staying the same? If it's busier, it could mean the business became the person's main way of making money. On the other hand, if it's slower, it could be because of a temporary slow period, the person hired someone else to work for them, or they scaled back the business. And if it stays the same, it might mean it has always been their main way of making money, or just a minor involvement.

People might have another job while also working for themselves or running a business. That other job could be their main way of making money. The important thing is to figure out if the business they are involved in while getting benefits is something that someone else would normally depend on for their main income if they were putting in the same amount of time and effort.

The continuous operation of a business can show that people are only self-employed to a small extent. This might happen when they have run a business for a long time while having a full-time job elsewhere, and if their involvement in the business is minimal and hasn't really changed since they stopped their full-time job. However, the continuity of the business might not matter if people take the time they are not working their full-time job to spend a lot more time on their self-employment activities.

There are some jobs that have busy and slow seasons, like businesses that are only open in the summer or winter. In these cases, someone might work full-time during the busy season but be unemployed when the business is closed. But if they are doing things to keep the business going during that slow period, like advertising the business, it needs to be considered if these tasks are a minor part of their work or not.",72.50691176470589,9.480980392156866,9.827888789773866,12.35686274509804,12.041691176470586,8.908333333333331,42.16666666666666,4.25,0.8882043520609538,0.8875637437616076,2.96124602330981,0.6152389176960026,0.4242640116066889,0.0769239859019974,4.3995098039215685,4.0,2.187240125718011,25.5,23.0,11.640446726822816,1.281862745098039,1.0,0.56574128084078,408,160,0.392156862745098,1846,16,4.6.4.5,Continuity of the employment or business,Chapter 4 - Week of unemployment,"The continuity of the business or of other employment in which claimants control their own working hours, is relevant insofar as it demonstrates the intentions and the real nature of the claimants' participation in these employment-related activities. The fact that the business continues to operate during the period claimants are claiming benefits, is a relevant consideration because it may indicate that the business is serious enough to require more than mere minor interest on the part of the claimant.\nThe business' level of activity is important to consider; has it increased, decreased, or remained constant?\n\nAn increase could mean the business is no longer a sideline or secondary occupation but a principal means of livelihood. It could also mean the claimant is simply spending a few more hours in the self-employment activities but these hours still remain less than those spent by someone following it as a principal means of livelihood\nA decrease could be because of a temporary decline in business, common at that particular time of year, because the claimant has hired someone to do their work, or due to the business activities having been permanently scaled back. Remaining constant could mean it has always been the claimant's principal means of livelihood, or may be a sign of minor in extent participation. For example, a claimant may have held a full-time job while running a business to which they devoted little time, and the time spent has not substantially changed following the termination of the full-time employment (FCA A-707-94, CUB 26138)\n\nClaimants may hold another job at the same time as they are self-employed or engaged in the operation of their business. That other job may constitute their principal means of livelihood. The issue is to decide whether their activity within the business, for the period they are claiming benefits, is carried out to such a minor extent that a person devoting the same time and effort would not normally rely on that activity as a principal means of livelihood.\nContinuity of the business can be used to substantiate that claimants are self-employed to a minor extent. This may occur when they have operated a business for many years while holding a full-time job elsewhere, and when the participation in the business is minimal and there has been no significant change in the participation following separation from full time employment (FCA A-707-94, CUB 26138). However, the continuity of the business may not be relevant when claimants use the period that they are unemployed from their full-time job, to spend significantly more time in self-employment activities.\nThere are many endeavours of a seasonal nature where there is an established pattern of shutdown, such as where there is no activity for the business during the summer or winter period, according to the type of business. In such a situation, a person may be considered to work a full working week during the active season and be unemployed during the period in which the business ceases its activities. However, should the person undertake activities necessary to the operation of that business during the seasonal closure, such as, marketing the services of the company, a determination as to whether or not these activities are minor in extent must be made (FCA A-614-94, CUB 25617).",0.94193995

We need to think about what the person really intends to do and how much time they spend on it.

The occupation practiced may tend to confirm or refute the claimant's allegations that the business is a sideline, as opposed to a principal means of livelihood.\nThe claimant's real intentions and time devoted must be considered. When the business or the other employment relates to or depends upon the claimant's skill or experience, then their participation becomes essential, and it is reasonable to assume that participation will be significant. Consideration must be given to the fact that claimants in this situation may become competitors of any employer who hires them, making it difficult for them to pursue their own trade anywhere but in their business. In this case, claimants may be making a principal means of livelihood out of the activity being set up, rather than relying on the remote possibility of securing work with a competitor.\nWhen the work performed falls outside the claimant's skill or experience, this may indicate that their participation is of only secondary importance unless of course, substantial time is devoted to the activity, or the claimant intends to make this work their principal means of livelihood.",0.88130283
169,169,169,"The availability of someone looking for a job helps decide how much to trust what they say about being mostly focused on running a business or having a job where they control their hours. This shows if they are serious about getting a new job and how hard they are trying to find one. People in this situation must be ready to take a suitable job right away, without any special conditions, and show they truly want to work. This availability is judged based on three things: being ready to work, not limiting job options, and showing a real desire to work. 

If someone is making a big effort to find a job, it suggests that their business or job with flexible hours is not their main way of making a living. But if they are not trying hard to find another job, it suggests the opposite. If their work seems to be affecting their ability to find a job, having a backup plan in place can show they are available to work.

However, some people might limit their availability because of their business or job with flexible hours, or they might not be actively looking for a job because of the work they need to do. In these cases, it might seem like their business or job is a big part of their life, making it hard to get benefits meant for those who are mostly looking for work themselves. 

It's okay for these people to still get benefits as long as they are genuinely looking for a job on their own and not just for their business. Tasks like following up with clients, promoting products, or finding new clients for the business do not count as actively searching for a job. 

Some unemployed people may use their time to focus on their business. But this might affect their joblessness status and availability, especially concerning how much time they spend working, how steady their business is, and how willing they are to find and take a new job.",71.77648127382825,9.802623906705538,9.851270322608157,12.65297151827764,12.153998654406813,8.535276967930024,44.46041713388652,4.769230769230769,0.9141230036815008,0.9028056968342174,3.0115575532351184,0.5702161197059827,0.4421659510687789,0.0510379399365667,4.329446064139941,4.0,2.270210554414862,26.384615384615383,27.0,7.0769230769230775,1.279883381924198,1.0,0.5942660792853195,343,144,0.4198250728862974,1517,13,4.6.4.7,Claimant's intention and willingness to seek and immediately accept alternate employment,Chapter 4 - Week of unemployment,"The claimant's availability serves to enhance or diminish the weight to be given to their statements as to whether or not they are primarily engaged in the operation of a business or in any other employment in which they control their working hours.\nThis factor makes it possible to verify a claimant's willingness to accept another job and the genuineness of their job search efforts (FCA A-104-00, CUB 44548A). The proof of availability required of such claimants is no different from that required of claimants in other circumstances (EIA 18; Digest Chapter 10). They must be prepared to immediately accept any suitable employment they are capable of performing, they must not set conditions, which unduly limit their employment opportunities, and, finally, they must behave in a manner which demonstrates their real desire to work. In the absence of a precise definition in the act, availability is verified by analysis of these 3 elements (FCA A-56-96, CUB 30987; CUB 72138).\nAn intensive job search may be an indication that a claimant's involvement in operating a business or working in employment in which they control their working hours, is to such a minor extent, that a person would not rely on it as a principal means of livelihood. Conversely, the absence of efforts to find other work, or restrictions made on availability tend to suggest the opposite.\nWhere the claimants' employment-related activities may appear to cause a restriction on availability, evidence that someone can take over if the claimant finds employment elsewhere, may support the claimant's statement that they can accept employment without any restrictions.\nOn the other hand, claimants may restrict their availability because of their business or other employment in which they control their working hours, or may impose certain requirements with respect to acceptance of a job. For example, they may impose undue conditions on acceptance of a job because of work required in the business, by restricting their availability to a few days a week or by making no effort to find a job. When this happens, there is reason to believe that the activity is not minor in extent.\nClaimants engaged in their business or in other employment in which they control their working hours, to a minor extent, can receive benefits provided they look for work on their own behalf, rather than on behalf of the business. Seeking employment and seeking contracts to work on one's own account are different. Seeking contracts for the business is not a job search within the meaning of the act. Client follow-up, marketing for the business' products or services, or searching for new clients for the business are not regarded as active job search activities under the act. The same applies during the farming period defined in EIR 30(4) or during a seasonal closure.\nClaimants may take advantage of the fact that they are unemployed to devote more time to their business. However, this may affect their unemployed status and availability, particularly in terms of 3 factors: time spent, continuity of the employment or business, and claimant's intention and willingness to seek and immediately accept alternate employment (EIA 18; Digest Chapter 10).",0.88503915
170,170,170,"Farm operators are individuals who work on farms. They are responsible for activities like growing crops, raising animals, and selling farm products to make money. They also take care of buildings, equipment, and fences on the farm.

People who operate farms are regulated similarly to other types of businesses. This means they have rules they need to follow, whether they work for themselves, with partners, or in collaboration with others.

To show that they are not fully employed and can receive benefits, farmers must prove that their farming activities are not their main source of income. An investigator will look at six specific factors to decide if the farmer is working full-time.

If farming is a farmer's main source of income, they are considered fully employed and cannot get benefits. However, there are certain times of the year when they might still qualify for benefits. During this period, farmers must prove they were not working much or were available for full-time work.

Farming involves growing plants and raising animals to sell and make a profit. The Canada Revenue Agency defines farming to include activities like plowing fields, raising livestock for show or sale, and farming dairy, fruits, or bees.

Farm Credit Canada can give loans to full-time or part-time farmers. Just having a loan from them does not automatically mean someone is a full-time farmer.

The agent must therefore examine the 6 factors provided for by EIR 30(3), to determine whether the claimant works full working weeks, during any weeks EI benefits are claimed.\nOnce it has been found that a person is engaged in farming as a principal means of livelihood, that person is regarded as working full working weeks and therefore not unemployed (EIR 30(1), (2), (3); FCA A-725-99, CUB 46122; Jurisprudence Index/week of unemployment/farming/). However, that person may still prove entitlement to benefits during the period that begins with the week in which October 1st falls, and ends with the week in which the following March 31st falls. To do so, they must prove that during that period, they did not work, or they were employed to such a minor extent, that it would not have prevented them from accepting full-time employment (EIR 30(4); Digest 4.6.5.1).\nA farm is an agricultural enterprise that combines capital and elementary production factors, such as plant and animal products and buildings, in a single economic and accounting unit, in order to draw from them a farm product destined for sale, with a view to realizing a profit.\nThe Canada Revenue Agency defines farming as:\n\ntillage of the soil (in other words, plowing, sowing, and raising crops)\nraising or exhibiting livestock\nmaintaining horses for racing\nraising poultry\nfur farming\ndairy farming\nfruit growing, and\nbee keeping\n\nFarming includes other activities such as:\n\nengaging in an aquaculture operation\noperating a woodlot\nplanting, growing, and harvesting Christmas trees\noperating a nursery or greenhouse\ngrowing tobacco or medicinal marijuana, but not the manufacturing or processing associated with these crops\noperating a chick hatchery\noperating a maple sugar bush, which may include extracting and collecting maple sap, or\ncultivating crops in water and hydroponics\n\nIt is not compulsory that farming be the person's principal occupation in order to be eligible for a farm loan from Farm Credit Canada. Since 1992 that agency has been authorized to grant or guarantee loans to full-time or part-time farmers. Consequently, the fact that a claimant has obtained a farm loan does not in itself prove that they are operating an agricultural enterprise on a full-time basis.

171,171,171,"People who work in farming are treated the same as people who run other types of businesses by the rules. If farming is their main way of making money, they are not considered unemployed even if they work full weeks. However, there are special rules for farmers between the weeks of October 1st and March 31st that allow them to still get benefits if they aren't working much in farming during that time. 

If a farmer wants to get benefits during this period, they have to show that they are not working much on the farm or that the work they do isn't stopping them from taking a full-time job somewhere else. The rules stay the same throughout the whole period, but can change if the farmer's situation changes, like if they sell the farm.

Factors like the type of farming, seasonal work, and the size of the farm determine how much a farmer can work during this special period. The farmer's job history is also important in deciding if they can get another job during this time.

If a farmer's off-season doesn't match the October 1st to March 31st period, they can't change the rules in their favor.

Once it has been found that a person is engaged in farming as a principal means of livelihood, that person is regarded as working full working weeks and therefore not unemployed (CUB 30067; Jurisprudence Index/week of unemployment/farming/).\nHowever, farming, because of the uniqueness of the business, has been given special considerations when determining the application of a disentitlement during the period that begins with the week in which October 1st falls, and ends with the week in which the following March 31st falls (EIR 30(4); CUB 68684) . This period is clearly defined in a regulatory provision and is not subject to any modification, regardless of the climatic conditions from one province to another.\nUnlike other types of business, a person engaged in farming as a principal means of livelihood may prove entitlement to benefits during the period that begins with the week in which October 1st falls and ends with the week in which the following March 31st falls.

It is the entire period, taken as a whole that must be considered. The decision remains unchanged for the entire period, unless of course the claimant's situation changes, for example the farm is sold or expanded. However, it must be kept in mind that the provision defined in EIR 30(4) only needs to be considered if the person does not meet the relieving provisions of minor extent under EIR 30(2).\nThe nature of the operation, seasonal activities for that type of operation, and the size of the farm are determining factors in deciding the extent of the work in farming during the period defined in EIR 30(4). The claimant's occupational history is an important indicator for determining whether the claimant is able, or has been able in the past, to accept full-time employment elsewhere during the defined period.\nIf the facts on file show that the off-season related to the claimant's employment in farming does not coincide with the period provided for in EIR 30(4), that regulatory period cannot be modified or extended to meet the local farming conditions of individual farmers.

There are 2 principal forms of partnership: a general partnership and a limited partnership. Both are based on a contract between 2 or more persons who pool their property, money and/or skills to operate an unincorporated business and to distribute profit from it to each partner. A partnership agreement may be written or verbal. A written contract normally sets out the responsibilities, the capital contributions and the time and energy that each partner will devote to the firm's business, as well as the respective shares of profits and losses that each partner will take.\nTheoretically, each partner participates in the administration of the partnership, signs contracts, and makes commitments on its behalf. However, the control and responsibility held by each partner varies depending whether the partnership is general or limited.\nIn a general partnership, every partner may take part in the management of the partnership business. All partners are administrators, unless otherwise designated, and are jointly liable for the partnership's obligations, and personally liable for its debts. This form of business is preferred by persons engaged in a professional activity (accountants, lawyers, doctors, architects, engineers, etc.) and by certain commercial concerns.\nClaimants may establish a limited partnership. This is a form of commercial enterprise composed of 2 kinds of partners: general partners and limited partners.\nThe important factor to remember is that general partners are those who set up, manage, administer and work in the business, while limited partners are those who contribute capital or property in the business, but are prohibited from taking an active role in its administration.\nWhen considering the unemployment status of a partner it is important to establish the exact nature of the claimant's status in the partnership, that is, whether the claimant is a general or a limited partner. By definition, a limited partner cannot be involved in the administration of the business, however if the claimant is a general partner, the nature and extent of their participation in the business activities must be determined (CUB 47156).",0.9961559
177,177,177,"Claimants are considered part of a joint business venture when they are personally involved in the activities of the business with others, regardless of how the business is legally structured. It does not matter if the business is officially registered. As long as the claimant has a stake in the business and is actively helping to run it, who officially owns the business is not the main factor in deciding if the claimant is part of the venture.

People who help out in a business without being paid, even if they have no legal ties to it, are also seen as part of a joint venture. Claimants can have different types of interest in a business, such as investing money in it or expecting to benefit from its success.

To figure out if a claimant is part of a joint business venture, the agent needs to look at how much the claimant is involved in the business and what they are doing. The agent also needs to make sure the claimant can control their own work hours and is not tied down by a work contract.

Agents need to understand the business structure, the owners, the shareholders, and how the claimant is related to the business. They also need details about the work done and the claimant's work history.

The agent needs to find proof that shows the claimant is truly invested in the business, to tell the difference between being part of the venture or just helping out voluntarily. Sometimes claimants might say they are just lending a hand, but the evidence in the file could reveal otherwise. Claimants who claim to be volunteers need to show that they are truly helping for free, with no personal gain and no obligations.

It makes no difference whether the business is registered or incorporated (FCA A-136-96, CUB 31814; FCA A-348-96, CUB 33274).\nAs long as the claimant has an interest in the business and is engaged in its operation, the question of who actually owns the business is not a decisive factor for determining whether the claimant is acting as a co-adventurer.\nCo-adventurers include individuals who contribute, without pay, to various tasks in a corporation in which others may be the sole shareholders, even though the individuals have no legal relationship with it.\nA claimant's interest in a business can take many forms, from money given or invested to assist the owner of the business, to the expectation of gaining from the profits or success of the business.\nTo determine if the claimant is a co-adventurer in the business, the agent must examine the real extent of the claimant's interest in the business, and the activity in which they are engaged (Digest 4.6.3). In the framework of this activity, the agent must ensure that the claimant controls their own hours of work and is not bound by a contract of service, or arrangements similar to a contract of service (EIR 29; EIR 31; FCA A-771-88, CUB 15420). \nThe agent must have an overview of the business: the owners, the shareholders, and the claimant's relationship with the owners, details about the job performed and, finally, the claimant's employment history.\nThe agent must bring out the elements that demonstrate the claimant's interest in the affairs of the company, as those elements distinguish between co-adventurer, and volunteering assistance to a business enterprise (Digest 4.6.9). In some cases, claimants may assert that they are merely giving the company a hand, but analysis of the facts in the file may demonstrate that the opposite is true. Claimants alleging volunteer work must prove that the assistance is provided free of charge, in a disinterested manner, and without obligation (CUB 70769).\nWhen a claimant has been found to be acting as a person engaged in a co-adventure, the 6 factors provided for by EIR 30(3) must be considered to determine if the claimant worked a full working week (EIR 30(2); Digest 4.6.4.1).",0.97811115
178,178,178,"A business corporation is a type of company that is owned by people who have shares in it. Its legal name typically ends with Limited (Ltd.), Incorporated (Inc.) or Company (Co.). A corporation is considered a legal entity separate from its owners, also known as shareholders. This means that legally, a corporation has its own rights and responsibilities. Unlike sole proprietorships or partnerships, a corporation can own property, sign contracts, and be responsible for debts just like an individual can.

In a corporation, the shareholders own the company by holding shares, but the company is managed by a board of directors. The board is in charge of running the company, appointing employees, and determining their roles and pay. The shareholders have some influence over the board because they get to elect its members, but the board itself makes the decisions for the company.

There are some corporations where there are only a few shareholders or even just one. In these cases, the owners may also be the managers, or the shareholders could hire others to run the company. It's possible not all shareholders are involved in managing the corporation.

Ownership is divided into shares. Its legal name ends with Limited (Ltd.), Incorporated (Inc.) or Company (Co.). Throughout this chapter, rather than using the full term corporation or limited company, corporation alone will be used.\nA corporation is an artificial being, invisible, intangible and existing only in the eyes of the law. This definition has led legal experts to affirm that a corporation is a legal entity, separate and distinct from those who own it, the shareholders. This characteristic confers upon the corporation, all the rights and responsibilities of a person. One of the significant differences between a sole proprietorship, a partnership and a corporation is that a corporation has a separate legal existence in law and it can own property, make contracts and be responsible for debts, just like any individual. One of the advantages of a corporate structure business organization is that the shareholders are able to invest and receive a regular return, without having to take any additional risk beyond the sum invested, or take an active part in management of the corporation's business affairs.\nAlthough shareholders are the true owners of the corporation in which they hold shares, a corporation is managed by a board of directors, which sees to its proper operation, appoints the employees it deems necessary, and determines their functions and remuneration. The board is elected by the shareholders who, in that respect, have some control over who will manage the corporation. However, the board itself is responsible for managing the corporation.\nSome corporations have a few shareholders, or, even only one. In these types of situations, there may be no real distinction between the owners and managers, and between the shareholders and the board of directors. The shareholders would likely be the people who manage the corporation. However, it is possible that not all shareholders participate in the running of the corporation.\nWhen considering the unemployment status of a shareholder it is important to determine the exact nature of the claimant's status in the corporation (FCA A-418-97, CUB 35899; Digest 4.6.8.1).",0.9956832
179,179,179,"The term ""piercing the corporate veil"" means looking beyond a company's separate identity to see the people who actually control it. This helps officials at the Commission assess a person's situation. In some cases, it's important to do this when the person is involved in running the company in ways beyond just being an employee.

By piercing the corporate veil, the Commission can:

- Figure out the true relationship between the person and the company
- Ignore the legal idea that companies are completely separate from their owners
- Consider any money the person earned from working for the company

Some individuals argue that the work they do benefits the company, not themselves personally, so they shouldn't be seen as self-employed. However, what matters is the person's involvement in running the company, not whether the company is legally separate from them. This holds true regardless of how much of the company they own.

Just because a shareholder in a company can receive employment benefits, it doesn't mean they're not self-employed when they are actively managing the company. The law doesn't intend to treat someone as not self-employed just because they created a company to operate within. 

When investigations show that a person is mainly involved in managing a company or is in charge of it, it is fair to say that they are engaged in its operations. It wouldn't be fair to give employment benefits to one person but not another just because one has a company and the other doesn't.",58.751892177589866,10.89138125440451,12.079253325248375,13.56786469344609,12.42331923890064,10.560310077519382,51.3615221987315,6.545454545454546,0.8399168848991394,0.8484762443436517,2.8872734739372814,0.446156059274571,0.4681786170122363,0.0576806012590709,4.697674418604652,4.0,2.553625333444426,23.454545454545453,21.0,9.228056393054196,1.4689922480620154,1.0,0.7373005918420282,258,127,0.4922480620155038,1265,11,4.6.8,Piercing the corporate veil,Chapter 4 - Week of unemployment,"The expression piercing the corporate veil means to ignore the separate existence of a corporation and look beyond the corporate veil, which shields the individuals controlling the corporation.

It's important to figure out what role they have in the company, as just being a shareholder doesn't mean they are involved in its day-to-day operations. When dealing with claimants who are shareholders and unemployed, it's crucial to determine their position in the company to see if they are active in running it. 

A claimant who is a shareholder might act as an investor, an employee with set work hours, someone running the business independently, or a combination of these roles. Sometimes a claimant can be both a paid employee and perform unpaid functions. When the Canada Revenue Agency confirms that a claimant's work is insurable, it means that for those hours, the claimant is considered an employee and may qualify for Employment Insurance benefits. However, being deemed insurable doesn't guarantee EI benefits â€“ the claimant must prove they are unemployed concerning the company. 

If a claimant remains active in the company, their status might be seen as employed for a full week unless certain exceptions apply. The total hours spent both as an employee and involved in the company's operations are considered. Certain company documents can help determine how involved a person is in the business.

The agent must identify the claimant's role in the corporation. The fact of being a shareholder in a corporation does not mean that the person is participating in the running of the business (Digest 4.6.7.5). When considering a matter relating to the unemployed status of claimants who are shareholders in a corporation, it is particularly important to establish the position they hold in the corporate structure and its related responsibilities, in order to determine whether they have a role in the operation of the business. The claimant could be acting as an investor (Digest 4.6.3.2), as an employee subject to a work schedule (EIR 29; EIR 31), as a person engaged in operating that corporation as a business on their own account or in a co-adventure (Digest 4.6.7.4), or a combination of these positions.\nSome claimants may be both a paid employee of the corporation and perform functions for which salary or wages are not paid.\nWhen the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) rules that the claimant's employment is insurable, it can be concluded that, for the working hours ruled insurable, the claimant acted as an employee subject to the work schedule of the corporation, and therefore may be eligible to receive EI benefits. However, the fact that CRA ruled the claimant's employment insurable does not mean the claimant will receive EI benefits. They must first demonstrate that they are unemployed, in relation to the corporation (FCA A-247-96, CUB 32697; FCA A-999-96, CUB 35986). Though the employment may be ruled insurable, the claimant could still be considered not unemployed if they are also participating in running the business.\nWhen the claimant continues to participate in the operation of the corporation, they will be considered to have worked a full working week unless the minor in extent exception is proven (EIR 30(2), 30(3)). The fact that the claimant worked in insurable employment is not relevant, nor is it a determining factor regarding the claimant's unemployed status in the period for which benefits are claimed. As well, the fact that the self-employment under review is the same employment used by the claimant to qualify to establish a claim for benefits, is irrelevant (FCA A-247-96, CUB 32697; FCA A-999-96, CUB 35986). It is the total number of hours a claimant spends in pursuing the business that must be considered, including the hours worked as an employee as well as those worked in the operation of the corporation. Consequently, when the claimant continues to participate in the operation of the corporation, the decision is made under the not unemployed provisions for self-employed workers, taking into account the number of hours worked as an employee, as well as those hours worked in the operation of the corporation (EIR 30).\nThere are certain documents that can assist in determining whether the person is involved in the running of the enterprise. The corporation maintains its articles, regulations, charter, list of directors, minutes of meetings, and is required to produce and archive an annual report that contains a significant amount of useful information about its activities.\nWhen a shareholder-employee of a corporation can lay themselves off, it raises the question of voluntary lay-off (EIA 30).

181,181,181,"Claimants can help out in a business owned by someone they know. It's important to consider all the details to figure out if the person helping is doing it for free or if they expect something in return. This helps determine if the person is truly volunteering, acting as an employee, or working together with the business owner.

People are considered volunteers when they:

- Don't get paid
- Don't receive any benefits or profits
- Help out without any obligation
- Don't have a work contract

If a person expects to receive any form of benefit for their help, then it's not considered volunteering. This includes getting money, promises of a job, free food and lodging, company shares, or benefitting from the success of a friend or relative's business. Claimants need to show that they aren't gaining any economic advantage by assisting.

If a person helps out without expecting anything in return and is not considered a co-adventurer, they are not seen as employed. This means they are providing help without any obligations and won't gain anything from it. Therefore, they are classified as unemployed regardless of their relationship with the business owner.

If someone is truly a volunteer and classified as unemployed, the next step is to determine if they are available to work. Being a volunteer means filling up free time while still actively looking for a job.

Lending a hand in a business means different things to different people. The agent must consider all the facts surrounding such assistance and establish the real situation between the parties to verify whether some type of compensation is received in return for that assistance. This consideration is necessary to determine if the claimant is truly a volunteer, or acting as an employee or as a co-adventurer in the business (Digest 4.6.7.4).\nClaimants are truly volunteers when:\n\nthey receive no pay for their work\nthey neither derive nor hope to derive any benefit, profit, financial or economic advantage from the work\nthe assistance is provided in a disinterested way without obligation, and\nthey are not bound by a contract of service, or arrangements similar to a contract of service (FCA A-962-88, CUB 15702)\n\nWhen a claimant receives or expects to receive something in return for their assistance, it can no longer be said that it is volunteer work (CUB 70769; FCA A-105-98, CUB 39928; Digest 5.16.2.2).

The assistance is provided in a disinterested way without obligation, and the claimant will not receive any benefit from it (FCA A-986-88, CUB 15699). In such a situation, it cannot be said that the claimant is engaged in the operation of a business, or that they are working under a contract of service because of the assistance given, even if the assistance is provided on a regular basis (CUB 50107; FCA A-341-79, CUB 5560). Therefore, the claimant will have proven that they are unemployed. This applies regardless of what the relationship is between the individuals (i.e. friend, relative or spouse).\nWhen it is determined that the person is truly a volunteer, and therefore unemployed, the agent must then rule on the question of availability. Volunteering assumes that the person provides assistance solely to fill up free time, while remaining available and looking for work (Digest Chapter 10.14.1). It is not the fact that the claimant is lending a hand that makes them not available, rather it is the absence of efforts to find work, or restrictions made on their availability because of the time spent assisting in the business.",0.93883437
182,182,182,"People who work for themselves, have their own business, control their own working hours, or work in a partnership are usually not considered unemployed. However, they may still be eligible for benefits like sickness, maternity, parental, compassionate care, and family caregiver benefits if they have enough work hours and meet the specific requirements for each benefit.

To receive these benefits, individuals must show that they are not working a full week and are truly unemployed. Factors like how much they rely on their business for income are considered. 

If someone both runs their own business and works as an employee, it's important to look at their role in the business to determine if they are truly unemployed. Benefits may not be paid if they are actively involved in the business.

When someone claims benefits, they need to prove they would have been available for work if they weren't sick, in order to receive sickness benefits. Other benefits like parental, compassionate care, and family caregiver benefits don't require proof of availability for work.

Overall, earnings from self-employment are only taken into account if the involvement in the business is minimal.

They must still have accumulated sufficient insurable hours to establish a benefit period and meet the entitlement conditions applicable to the specific type of benefits being requested (EIA 7; Digest 1.2.0). However, payment of such benefits is considered only in respect of a week of unemployment: in other words, only for those weeks during which the claimant did not work a full working week (EIA 11).\nClaimants demonstrate that they are unemployed and not working a full working week when they prove that their employment-related activities in their business are performed to such a minor extent, that a person would not normally rely on that employment as a principal means of livelihood (EIR 30(2); Digest 4.6.4). The agent must examine the 6 factors provided for by EIR 30(3) to determine whether or not the claimant works a full working week for the period in respect of which special benefits are being claimed (CUB 25211; Digest 4.6.4.1).\nWhen a claimant engaged in the operation of a business also works as an employee in insurable employment, it is particularly important to establish the position and the related responsibilities the claimant holds in the corporate structure, in order to determine whether the claimant has a role in the operation of the business (Digest 4.6.8). Even when the employment is ruled insurable, the claimant may still be considered not unemployed if, in addition to working as an employee, they are participating in the running of the business.\nWhen the claimant continues to participate in the operation of the corporation, for the period in respect of which special benefits are being claimed, they will be considered to be working full working weeks unless the minor in extent exception is proven (EIR 30(2), 30(3)). When claimants do not meet the minor in extent exception, no sickness, maternity, parental, compassionate care or family caregiver benefits are payable in respect of such weeks.\nEarnings from self-employment are only allocated when the claimant's involvement or engagement in the self-employment is determined to be minor in extent (EIR 35; Digest 5.16.0).  If it is not, a disentitlement for full working weeks is imposed, rather than allocating earnings. \nWhen persons claiming and satisfying the conditions to receive maternity, parental, compassionate care and/or family caregiver benefits meet the minor in extent exception, such benefits are payable for each week of unemployment within the period of leave.\nThere is an additional provision that applies to persons claiming sickness benefits. These claimants must also prove that, had it not been for their incapacity, they would have been otherwise available for work (EIA 18). This second condition provided for by the act is aimed at limiting the payment of sickness benefits solely to persons who would have been eligible for regular benefits, had it not been for their incapacity for work (Digest 11.3.0). Sickness benefits are payable for each week of unemployment in the period when claimants meet both the first entitlement condition, that they are unemployed, and the second condition, that they would have been otherwise available for work.

On the other hand, a contract for services involves one party agreeing to complete specific tasks for another party without being controlled by the payer. The more control the employer has over the worker, the more it leans towards a contract of service, while more independence indicates a contract for services.",52.598902202072566,11.916159326424872,13.02386679866686,14.624093264248708,14.49975388601036,12.769119170984451,56.76748704663213,7.875,0.8708858149392265,0.852461059888204,2.590004967944904,0.3605887979739634,0.5147905004304929,0.0695262094006429,5.067357512953368,5.0,2.7730422794439056,24.125,25.0,8.283077628514658,1.5336787564766838,1.0,0.8080908482852601,193,119,0.616580310880829,997,8,4.7.6,Professionals - Doctors lawyers accountants etc.,Chapter 4 - Week of unemployment,"Professional people, such as doctors, lawyers or accountants, who carry on their activity in an independent office may easily be regarded as a distinct group when compared with independent workers who contract their services, and persons who operate a business on their own account. In fact, while they may not be primarily interested in conducting a business or in performing under a contract for services, they nevertheless become self-employed in order to pursue their own profession, and their activity generally requires the services of at least one employee who looks after administrative work.\nAs such, claimants who find themselves in this category of workers would be considered working full weeks and would not be eligible for EI benefits. Very exceptional circumstances would have to be proven on behalf of an individual to show that such employment is so minor in extent that a person would not normally follow it as a principal means of livelihood.\n\n\nAppendix A - Type of contract\nDifference between a contract of service and a contract for services\nContract of service\nA contract of service is an arrangement (either written or oral) whereby an individual, the employee, agrees to work on a full-time or part-time basis for the other party to the contract, the employer, for either a specified or indeterminate period of time.\nUnder such a contract, one party (the employee), serves another party (the employer), in return for a salary or some other form of remuneration. The employer has the right of control and can direct the manner in which the employee carries out the duties to be performed.\nContract for services\nA contract for services is an arrangement whereby one party agrees to perform certain specific work for another party, as stipulated in a contract; it usually calls for the accomplishment of a clearly defined task, but does not normally require the party paying for the service to do anything themselves. There is no right to control the methods of work and no boss/employee relationship.\n\nDifference between a contact of service and a contract for services\n\n\nContract of service\nContract for services\n\n\n\n\nIndicates an employer/employee relationship.\nIndicates a principal (payer) to independent contractor (worker) relationship.\n\n\nOne party agrees, for either a period of time or indefinitely, to work either full or part time, for another party. It is a contract for one party to serve another party for remuneration.\nOne party (the worker) agrees to do a specified job or task for another. It is a contract to produce a thing or result for a price. Usually for a specified period of time.\n\n\nPayer determines not only what is to be done but also how it is to be done.\nWorker determines the method for accomplishing the work.\n\n\nWorker is performing the services for the payer's profit or loss.\nWorker is performing the services for the profit or loss of their own business.\n\n\nThe payer has the right to control the worker (whether or not the right is actually exercised).\nThe payer does not have the right to control the worker in the performance of their services. (The fact that the payer has the right to determine what they want and when should not be construed as controlling how the worker accomplishes their job).\n\n\nThe greater the amount of direct control, the stronger the argument for a contract of service.\nThe greater the independence from control, the stronger the argument for a contract for services.",0.90719193
192,192,192,"The Employment Insurance Act (EIA) is like an insurance plan that helps people who lose their jobs by providing them with money. To qualify for this help, individuals need to show that they are unemployed each week and meet certain conditions. 

If someone receives money or benefits as a result of their job loss, like severance pay or other work-related benefits, this can affect the amount of financial assistance they get from EIA. This is done to make sure they don't get paid twice for the same thing. 

The chapter explains how the amount of money a person receives is determined and how it affects their EIA benefits. More details about how earnings impact benefit claims can be found in other parts of the EIA document. 

It's important to note that determining if a type of money is covered by EIA is not the same as deciding if it counts as earnings. Additionally, how money is treated under income tax laws or other legislation does not change how earnings are handled under EIA.

Once a claim is established, claimants must demonstrate that each week of benefit claimed is a week of unemployment and that no circumstances or conditions exist that would disentitle or disqualify them from receiving benefits.\nOne of the circumstances or conditions that would reduce benefits payable is the receipt of moneys or non-pecuniary (non-monetary) benefits that are considered earnings for EI purposes. Any compensation received for the loss of employment, as well as any wages, salary and any other pecuniary or non-pecuniary benefits related to, attached to, or arising out of employment, reduces or nullifies the financial loss incurred by the claimant. In order to prevent double indemnification, these benefits and advantages will be deducted from EI benefits.\nThis chapter discusses the determination and allocation of earnings to be deducted from EI benefits. Other impacts of earnings on a claim for benefits can be found in other chapters of this Digest (Digest Chapter 1, Digest Chapter 2).\nDetermining that moneys are insurable is different than determining whether they are earnings for the purposes of paying EI benefits. Therefore, the earnings provisions covered in this chapter are not relevant to whether or not earnings are insurable (EIA 90). As well, the treatment of moneys under the Income Tax Act, or any other legislation, does not have any bearing on whether earnings are allocated under the EI legislation.\nThere are special provisions in place for the consideration of earnings while a claimant is participating in the Work-sharing program (EIA 24; EIR 47; Digest Chapter 25).",0.9153625

When claimants make personal choices regarding moneys based on incorrect information provided or action taken by the Commission regarding their earnings, there could be negative results to the claimant. In these situations however, claimants cannot obtain relief from those results based on the fact they were given incorrect information; the legislation governing the determination and allocation of earnings must be applied (FCA A-2-05, CUB 62223).\nIn all cases, the primary question to satisfy when considering the impact of moneys on the payment of EI benefits is why those moneys are paid. It is crucial that all facts and evidence concerning the moneys and why they are paid, be obtained before a decision is made. This is particularly of consequence in unusual or unique situations.",0.95788413
195,195,195,"The Commission, along with the approval of the Governor in Council, has the power to create rules that define what counts as earnings. This rule, EIR 35, helps decide what money is considered as earnings for benefit purposes. It determines how much should be taken out of EI benefits or if there's been a gap in earnings. Sometimes, it helps figure out how much money should be given back to the Commission by the person claiming benefits, the employer, or a trustee during specific situations.

This rule only includes money earned through work or similar activities. Money related to work or that comes from a job is usually considered earnings. However, money received from things like investments, luck, charity, or personal matters is not considered earnings.

Typically, earnings include money from wages, salary, benefits, and anything else related to a job. This also covers payments made for lost income, like from a car insurance plan.

On the other hand, payments received that have nothing to do with work, such as alimony, lottery winnings, or inheritances, are not considered earnings. Also, payments for things not connected to work, like injuries or pain and suffering compensation after an accident, are not earnings.

To figure out if a payment counts as work-related earnings, it's important to understand the true nature of the payment. Just going by what the payment is called is not always enough. In case of doubt, looking at documents and contacting all involved parties can help clarify. Even though the burden of proof falls on the person claiming benefits, the Commission might also help gather evidence.

When terms aren't clearly defined in EI laws, it's necessary to understand how each word is used in the rules. Dictionaries and legal precedents can provide more clarity.

Earnings to be considered are the total amount before any deductions like taxes or premiums. Some deductions might be allowed, like legal fees necessary to get the money.

EIR 35 was made under that authority. Its purpose is to determine what moneys are or are not earnings for benefit purposes. The moneys concluded to be earnings are used in determining the amount to be deducted from EI benefits or whether an interruption of earnings has occurred. In some cases, they are also taken into account to determine the amount of benefits to be repaid to the Commission by the claimant, the employer, or a trustee in bankruptcy, under certain circumstances (EIR 35(2); EIA 45, EIA 46).\nThis authority is limited to include only those moneys or advantages that are earned by labour, or that resemble such (FCA A-178-86). Moneys or advantages are considered earned by labour, or resemble them, when they relate to, are attached to, or arise out of employment. The moneys must clearly demonstrate the character of a consideration given in return for work done by the recipient (FCA A-597-94, CUB 25472). This is not the case for moneys received from investment or capital, through chance, through charity, or through a personal relationship (Digest 5.3.1).\nGenerally, earnings are any moneys paid for wages, salary, pecuniary benefits and all other advantages, pecuniary or non-pecuniary, which are related to, attached to or arising out of employment (Digest 5.3.0). Any compensation for the loss of any of these types of income is also earnings for EI benefit purposes, including income replacement payments through a motor vehicle insurance plan.\nConversely, payments made for reasons unrelated to employment, such as alimony, lottery winnings and inheritances, are not earnings for benefit purposes. Similarly, any compensation for losses totally unrelated to employment is not earnings (FCA A-34-91, CUB 17395A). For example, settlements paid to address injury to a claimant's health or reputation or to compensate for pain or suffering resulting from an accident are not earnings (Digest 5.12.11; Digest 5.11.4; Digest 5.11.8).\nThe true nature of the payments must be established to determine whether they are advantages related to, attached to, or arising out of employment. Relying solely on what the parties call the moneys is sometimes insufficient, as the name given to a payment does not necessarily determine its true nature (FCA A-599-92, CUB 20965). When doubt exists about the true nature of a payment, the best way to clarify the issue is to examine the intentions of the parties, by reviewing all relevant documents and contacting all the parties involved. Although the onus of proof is on the claimant, the Commission may assist in providing or clarifying the evidence by contacting the employer or any other party.\nWhen terms are not defined in the EI legislation, the meaning given individual words must be examined in the context in which they are used in the legislation. Dictionaries and jurisprudence may often provide further clarification.\nThe earnings to be taken into account are the gross earnings before any deductions such as income tax, CPP, QPP or EI premiums (CUB 79991). Amounts may be deducted from the gross earnings, such as legal fees incurred to receive those earnings (Digest 5.3.3), or deductions from self-employment (Digest 5.16.0).

204,204,204,"The law says that earnings include all the money someone makes from working. To figure out if money comes from work, we need to understand what ""employment"" means. Employment can be any type of work under an agreement, whether it's insurable or not, where services are provided to someone, and where the person getting paid has an employer who selects and pays them. There should also be a level of control by the employer over the work being done. Just being an employee isn't enough to prove that money received is from employment; it must be payment for the work done.

Employment can be a traditional job working for an employer, even if it's not insurable. It can also include situations where work is expected but not done, like in cases of lay-offs. Even if a job offer is withdrawn before any work is done, it still counts as employment. Self-employment, like running your own business, is also considered employment. Having a certain position, like being a mayor or a member of a board, also falls under employment.

In some cases, money received from someone related to your job can be considered earnings, like if a business is sold and new owners pay you.

What must be determined is whether an employment relationship exists between the person who makes the payment, and the one who receives it. It may be useful in these situations to refer to the general definition of the term employment found in the dictionary, to complement the meaning of employment as stated in the regulation. The dictionary definitions generally refer to an employer-employee relationship and the fact that the employer or the person to whom the service is due, both selects and compensates the employee, or person rendering the service. In other words, the person for whom the work is done has the power to hire and fire the person who is performing the service, and agrees to pay that individual for the services performed. In addition, employment usually includes some degree of control by the person employing, over the product or service produced, as well as the time taken to do so.\nSimply being an employee of an employer is not sufficient to establish that any payment made by that employer arises out of employment. In order to arise out of employment, the payment must display the character of compensation given in return for the work done by the recipient. It must arise out of the employment itself, and not merely as a consequence of the employment status of the recipient (FCA A-597-94, CUB 25472).\nEmployment under any express or implied contract of service requires that there be an employer-employee relationship and that the relationship involves some form of remuneration or material benefit that may be direct or indirect, immediate or eventual.\nEmployment clearly includes the traditional situation where a claimant works under a contract of service for an employer, whether or not the employment is insurable. It also includes excluded employment as stated in EIA 5(2), employment anywhere in the world, or employment under a contract of service with the Reserve or Regular Armed Forces (EIA 5(1)).\nEmployment may also include situations where services are not performed. The issue to be addressed is whether there is an express or implied contract of service, or other contract of employment. Claimants, who after lay-off, continue to receive their salary and most of the benefits of the other employees, are under a continuing employment relationship with the employer, even though no work or services are expected or performed (CUB 69694).\nEmployment under any other contract of employment includes any employment that may not clearly be an express or implied contract of service. It includes situations where a claimant has accepted an offer of employment and the employer withdraws the offer before any actual services are performed. In this situation, a contract of employment was formed, therefore any moneys received as a result of the breach of that contract are considered earnings as they are income arising out of employment (FCA A-1205-88, CUB 15956). It also includes situations where a claimant receives moneys because the employer bypassed that claimant's recall rights and hired someone else with less seniority. However, employment does not include cases where a person receives compensation for not being hired by an employer, where that person has no recall rights or connection with the employer.\nSelf-employment, whether on one's own account or in a partnership or co-adventure, is included in the meaning of employment (Digest 5.16.0). Employment exists when a claimant is engaged in the operation of a business, or operating as an independent worker or contractor (Digest 4.6.0).\nTenure of an office is included in the meaning of employment as defined in the Canada Pension Plan Act:\noffice means the position of an individual entitling him to a fixed or ascertainable stipend or remuneration and includes a judicial office, the office of a minister of the Crown, the office of a lieutenant governor, the office of a member of the Senate or House of Commons, a member of a legislative assembly or a member of a legislative or executive council, and any other office the incumbent of which is elected by popular vote or is elected or appointed in a representative capacity, and also includes the position of a corporation director, and officer means a person holding such an office.\nExamples of a person holding tenure of an office are a mayor, council member, chairperson or member of a board of referees, school trustees, or members of the board of directors of a corporation.\nEmployment can be said to exist even if the claimant receives the income from a person other than the person with whom the contract of service exists or existed, and for whom the services are or will be performed (EIR 35(1)). This other person could be someone who stands in the place of an employer or the employer's successor, if the business is sold. It could also be a customer who tips a server. However, a clear connection must be established between the employment or employer and the other person, in order for the moneys to be considered arising out of employment (FCA A-486-95, CUB 28503). Examples of any other person, as envisioned by the regulation, are a Workers' Compensation Board, an insurance company paying wage-loss insurance benefits, an administrator of a pension fund, or a wage protection fund (Digest 5.12.9).\nAlimony, lottery winnings or inheritances do not arise out of employment, as these moneys are clearly not received by reason of an employment relationship.",0.87364614

Therefore, strike pay is not earnings because:\nunion members are not performing any services for the union itself, nor are they receiving any form of remuneration or material benefit of any kind for services\nthe activities performed are only activities on the union members' own behalf, in their pursuit of a contract with their employer\nthese activities are part of the contract negotiation process and are activities for which union members volunteer, or pursue for their own benefit\nthe union does not have an employer-employee relationship with its members, and\nthe union is not compensating members for any services. It is merely distributing moneys set aside from union dues or other sources, for later use during labour disputes\nHowever, any activities performed for the union itself in conducting the business of the union, (such as being part of the negotiating team for which compensation is received) are considered employment if it can be established that the union is paying for services performed.",0.9925499
208,208,208,"Benevolent or volunteer work is when someone helps out without getting paid. They aren't chosen and don't expect payment. If there's no official work agreement, it's not seen as a job. Even if a person gets some benefits like a place to stay, it's not considered a job if they aren't required to work in exchange. It's also not seen as a job when someone helps a friend or family member without a work contract.

However, if someone does the volunteer work expecting something in return, like money or benefits, then it becomes like a job. If a spouse is employed and the other helps out, it's only considered a job if both are part of the work contract. If one spouse is self-employed and the other helps out occasionally, it's not seen as a job. But if the help goes beyond just occasionally, then that person might be considered self-employed.

When someone volunteers for a company, it becomes a job if there's an agreement between the person and the employer. If the volunteer receives any form of payment or benefits, it's seen as work. For example, volunteer fire fighters who get paid are considered employees. If there's no promise of payment for the volunteer work, the person might just hope to get a paid job there in the future. If it's decided that there's an employer-employee relationship, any benefits or money received is seen as work income.

It lacks the elements of employment in that the individual is not usually selected to perform the service (they volunteer), and there is no expectation to receive any remuneration or material benefit (CUB 74353). A person engaged in such volunteer work is not bound under a contract of service. The absence of such contract is a decisive factor in determining whether the benevolent work is considered employment. Therefore, in the absence of a contract of service, a claimant who provides services as a benevolent gesture is considered not to be in employment. This is true even if, in some very unusual instances, the claimant may receive certain benefits by living on the premises, such as room and board, without any obligation to perform services (CUB 21373; Digest 4.5.6).\nBenevolent or volunteer work for a friend, a relative or a spouse is generally not considered employment, as there is no contract of service (Digest 4.1.5, Digest 4.5.4, Digest 4.5.5). The performance of services is more related to the personal relationship with the person, and there is no expectation of receiving any remuneration or material benefit. Benevolent or volunteer work is considered employment only when the volunteer receives, or expects to receive, remuneration or material benefit (CUB 42191). In that situation, it can no longer be said that it is benevolent work, as on one side there is an expectation of services to be rendered, and on the other side, there is an expectation of payment. Any income, whether pecuniary or non-pecuniary, received by the claimant is then considered to be arising out of employment.\nBenevolent or volunteer work for a spouse who is under a contract of service, is considered employment only if the contractual relationship applies to both spouses. If the spouse is self-employed, consideration is given to the nature of the duties and responsibilities carried out by each spouse in the operation of the business. If it appears that the claimant is not particularly concerned with the business, but merely helps out on occasion, the assistance given is not regarded as employment (Digest 4.5.5). However, if the efforts go beyond merely helping out, the individual may be found to be in self-employment (Digest 4.6.9).  Digest 5.3.3.2 provides additional information on whether moneys paid to one spouse by the spouse holding the contract can be deducted as an expense.\nWhen the benevolent or volunteer work is performed for an employer, the issue again is whether there is a contract of service between both parties. This requires the existence of an employer-employee relationship and involves some form of remuneration or material benefit, direct or indirect, immediate or eventual. The very essence of the employer-employee relationship, when volunteer work is performed for an employer, is the fact that the worker will obtain, or hopes to obtain, a benefit or profit from the work. This is the case when a volunteer fire fighter receives remuneration, whether periodically or in a lump sum, for acting as a member of a fire department. The remuneration and its expectation make this employment. Where no remuneration is promised for the volunteer work, the person may simply hope to obtain regular paid employment from that employer in the future (FCA A-1009-90, CUB 18752). Where it is found that there is an employer-employee relationship, any income received by the claimant, whether pecuniary or non-pecuniary,  is considered to be arising out of employment. However, if the claimant receives no income, a value cannot be affixed to the services  It then becomes an issue of whether or not the claimant is actually unemployed (Digest chapter 4), or available for work (Digest chapter 10).",0.9956656

If you are actively participating in the business operations like an employee, then the money earned is considered employment income. However, if your involvement is minimal and only related to protecting your investment, then the money made is a return on investment.

Ways you can earn a return on investment include getting interest, dividends, rent, equity pay-outs, profits, or capital gains. Royalties paid for using property you own, like gas or oil rights, are also considered a return on investment. On the other hand, royalties paid for creative work like songs or books are considered employment income.

Only when there is involvement in the operation of a business, can it be said that there is work performed by the person. When there is only an investment of funds or capital and no participation by the owner, the investor is not engaged in the operation of the business and there is no element of employment. Moneys gained from a return on investment or a return on capital do not arise out of employment or self-employment.\nAlthough generally there is no work or labour when there is a return on investment, there may be some small element of participation by the owner, in the operation of a business owned as an investment. As long as the nature of the participation demonstrates only a natural concern for an investment, that participation is not enough to change moneys arising out of an investment to moneys arising out of self-employment (Digest 4.6.3.2). In determining this, the decisive factor is the nature of the activities of the person in the operation of the business, and not necessarily the amount of time spent. If the activities performed are in the nature of a person engaged or involved in the operation of a business, then the moneys earned arise out of employment, and not from a return on investment (CUB 68317; Digest 4.6.3).\nIf the activities are in the nature of concern with how others operate the business, or concern with protecting the investment itself, then the moneys are a return on investment. Without the element of engagement or involvement in the operation of a business, the individual is neither engaged in self-employment, nor engaged in the operation of a business on their own account, or in a partnership or co-adventure. As such, any moneys derived from the business are not considered earnings for EI benefit purposes. \nA return on investment, or a return on capital, may result from:\nthe investment of moneys\nthe acquisition, holding, or disposal of property or securities (stocks, bonds, notes, convertible debentures, warrants, or other documents that represent a share in a company or debt owed by a company), or\nthe contribution of money or property to a business venture so that it may produce revenue\nA return on investment is normally in the form of interest, dividends, rent, pay out of equity, profits or capital gains (FCA A-572-95, CUB 28759; CUB 35113).\nRoyalties are paid to the owner of a property for the use of that property. Whether these royalties are considered a return on investment depends on why these moneys were paid. Royalties paid to the creator of a property, such as, computer software, a song, a book, a commercial, or record royalties paid to the composer, author, or singer, are not considered a return on investment. These royalties are the result of labour by the actor, composer, author, or singer, therefore are earnings arising out of employment (CUB 78103). Royalties paid to the owner of a property, based on the mere ownership of that property (gas, oil or mining properties), are not earned by the property owner's labour, and therefore are considered a return on investment.\nInterest, which is earned on a saving's account, a certificate of deposit, or a loan, arises solely from the moneys in the account, on deposit or on loan. The interest does not arise from any labour by the person who owns the account, who placed the moneys on deposit, or who made the loan. It arises exclusively from the use of the money itself. As a result, the interest earned is a return on investment. This is true even if the interest is paid by an employer to compensate for an administrative delay in payment of moneys owed to a claimant.\nIncome earned by investment alone is not earnings, even if the claimant spends a substantial amount of time following the progress of the investment.

In this type of contract, the person doing the work is responsible for achieving a specific goal within a certain timeframe. The one giving the grant is usually not involved in how the work is done. This type of agreement falls under self-employment.

A grant is not linked to employment if it's given as a gift without any requirement for a service, labor, or a product. It becomes related to employment only when the recipient is expected to provide a service, labor, or a product in return.

Money given as compensation for the time or effort put in by grant recipients is linked to employment. However, money paid out for things like equipment or expenses not directly related to the work performed by the recipient are not considered related to employment.

The portion paid as part of a severance package is paid by reason of a lay-off or separation, and is allocated in the specified manner (EIR 36(9); Digest 5.12.2.1).\nHowever, for students attending courses not sponsored by the Commission, any allowances paid for attendance at a course are deducted from EI benefits payable (EIA 19(4); EIR 16(1)).\n\n\n5.3.1.10 Foster care\nFoster care is acting in the place of a parent to provide a home for a child, even though that child is not related to the foster caregiver, either by blood or by legal ties. Foster care may be compared to benevolent or volunteer work and should not be considered employment, unless there is remuneration or some expectation of remuneration, in return for that care.\nAlthough expenses incurred in the raising of the foster child may be reimbursed on a per diem basis by the organization or another party, this in itself, is not sufficient remuneration or expectation of remuneration to consider foster care as a form of employment. The moneys received from an agency to compensate for expenses incurred in raising a foster child do not arise out of employment.\nHowever, if an individual enters into a contract for service with another party to provide foster care for a fee, in addition to or instead of expenses, then foster care is considered employment. The organization is paying the individual to care for the child, and for that care, the organization is willing to provide compensation, therefore an employment relationship is formed. Only the portion of the income that is the fee for the foster care would be income arising out of employment; any portion that is for expenses incurred is not part of the entire income (Digest 5.3.3.1). If expenses are not reimbursed, the operating expenses actually incurred may be deducted from any fees paid (EIR 35(10)(c); Digest 5.16.0).",0.88441247
214,214,214,"This part only talks about money you make from your job. It's called income. It includes money you get from your employer or someone else, like if you win a lawsuit. Income can be money or things that are not money. It's important that the money is connected to your job. For example, if a client pays a self-employed person, or if a government pays out of a fund for workers.

Income also includes benefits you get from your job, like vacation pay, holiday pay, or any other special benefits your employer gives you. But things like money from investments, alimony, or lottery winnings are not considered income for these benefits. If money is given for job-related expenses, like travel for work, that's not considered income either.

When looking at how much money you make, we count all the money you earn before any deductions. This includes things like taxes taken out of your paycheck. We also convert any money you make in another currency to Canadian dollars.",77.83618393234674,6.287251585623679,9.80015041476705,9.74291754756871,7.528414376321351,8.698604651162785,35.98520084566596,3.1818181818181817,0.7690294623374939,0.7918690840403239,2.4676314419089302,0.660444233022175,0.480726717810805,0.0892269560819488,4.488372093023256,4.0,2.1794184526564284,15.636363636363637,13.0,10.271520443994888,1.337209302325581,1.0,0.6308072553497136,172,91,0.5290697674418605,803,11,5.3.2,The entire income,Chapter 5 - Earnings,"This section deals only with income that arises out of employment. These earnings have been specifically included under EIR 35(2), as they are either related to, or attached to, employment. Other earnings that may fit the general definition of income, but do not necessarily arise directly out of employment, are discussed in section 5.4.0 of this Digest.\nIncome is defined in EIR 35(1) as:\nany pecuniary or non-pecuniary income that is or will be received by a claimant from an employer or any other person, including a trustee in bankruptcy.\nPecuniary is defined in the dictionary as, consisting of, or measured in money. Conversely non-pecuniary means consisting of, or measured in something other than money (Digest 5.3.2.1).\nIn addition to the meaning of income provided in the regulations, the Commission also relies on its common dictionary meaning. The dictionary refers to income as a gain or recurrent benefit, usually measured in money that derives from capital or labour (CUB 80836). Although this definition includes moneys earned by capital, the wording of the legislation limits income to that which is earned by labour, or that resembles it (FCA A-597-94, CUB 25472).  In addition, the payment must be made to compensate for work performed, or to be performed by the employee, under the terms and conditions of employment, and not merely as a consequence of the recipient's employment status.\nIn order for the payment to be considered income, a clear connection must be established between the employment or employer and the person receiving the payment. An example is a customer or client who makes payments to a self-employed person. Other examples of other person as envisioned by the regulation, are a government who makes payments under a wage protection fund (FCA A-486-95, CUB 28503), or an insurance company who pays lost wages to employees who are unable to work because of a motor vehicle accident (EIR 35(2)(d); FCA A-378-96, CUB 33206).\nThe meaning given to the word income under any other legislation is not relevant and cannot be applied over the meaning clearly stated in the EI legislation (CUB 42860).\nAny moneys that arise from employment are income (Digest 5.3.1). Generally, income is any pecuniary or non-pecuniary benefits, such as, wages, salary, and all other advantages or employment-related benefits that are related to, attached to, or arising out of employment (Digest 5.3.2). As well, compensation for the loss of any of these benefits is income for EI benefit purposes.\nAn employment-related benefit is something given by an employer to compensate the employee for work performed, in addition to the basic hourly wage or monthly salary. It is part of the total compensation package offered by an employer. It may include items required by labour laws, such as vacation pay and statutory holiday pay and items called fringe benefits (Digest 5.3.2.2). Payments that do not arise out of employment are not income for benefit purposes. This includes investment income, alimony, lottery winnings and inheritances.\nAny compensation for losses that are totally unrelated to the advantages arising out of employment, is not income (Digest 5.12.11). For example, settlements paid to address injury to one's health or reputation,  or for pain or suffering resulting from an accident (Digest 5.11.4, Digest 5.11.8), are not income, as these settlements are not for loss of wages or employment advantages (i.e. employment-related benefits).\nMoneys that are paid by an employer to reimburse or to compensate specifically for a job-related expense incurred or to be incurred by the employee, or a job-required consideration, are not income as there is no gain or benefit (Digest 5.3.3.1). These payments for job-related expenses and job-required considerations are not paid to compensate for work performed by that employee. Rather, they are intended to reimburse for the extra costs incurred in performing the job duties.\nWhere no amount is paid to reimburse a specific job-related expense or to compensate for a job-required consideration supplied by the employee, these expenses may be deducted from the gross income, if they were incurred for the direct purpose of earning that income (Digest 5.3.3.2).\nThe earnings to be taken into account are the claimant's gross earnings (FCA A-866-87, CUB 14091) which include the usual deductions, such as income tax, union dues, EI premiums, or the employee's own contributions to a pension or wage-loss insurance plan. The employer's share of the contributions to a pension fund is not included in the gross earnings of the claimant. The right to these employer contributions does not occur when they are earned, but rather only later when specific conditions have been fulfilled (Digest 5.13.0).\nEarnings paid in foreign funds are converted to Canadian dollars at the rate of exchange existing at the time the earnings were paid or payable.",0.49837634
215,215,215,"The rules EIR 35(1) and 35(10)(d) to 35(16) talk about how non-money income, like free food or housing, is considered as income. This applies to both employees and self-employed people. The rules explain how to figure out the value of things like free housing or other benefits that are received because of work. 

Sometimes, instead of money, people get paid in things like housing, meals, or other benefits from their job. This is called non-pecuniary income. If someone gets these kinds of benefits from an employer or a customer, it counts as income. 

Non-pecuniary income includes things like free rent, utilities, or any extra benefits given by the employer. If an employer gives an employee something other than money for their work, like a car, that counts as non-pecuniary income. 

If there's a disagreement about the value of these benefits, the Commission will decide. The value is usually based on what nearby rentals cost. However, if a person does work but doesn't get money or non-money benefits, the Commission can't assign a value to their work. 

It's important to know that if a non-money benefit is related to employment, it will be subtracted from the person's employment insurance benefits. 

It's not necessary for there to be a written work contract for these non-pecuniary benefits to be considered income from work. Even if no money changes hands in a barter situation, the value of the items exchanged is still income. 

Basically, if someone gets non-money benefits because of work, they usually count as income. But if the benefits are from volunteering or a gift, they might not count as income.",69.96170774647891,7.910669014084508,11.333407214811013,11.747887323943662,8.971690140845073,9.406478873239436,39.22887323943662,3.8125,0.8203711231549581,0.8191782534122467,2.8085175154360105,0.6456700877368801,0.4614561604869857,0.0863006555180004,4.570422535211268,4.0,2.39541195058664,17.75,18.0,5.640257086339239,1.4049295774647887,1.0,0.7374133957065243,284,123,0.4330985915492957,1359,16,5.3.2.1,Non-pecuniary income,Chapter 5 - Earnings,"EIR 35(1) and 35(10)(d) to 35(16) provide for the inclusion of non-pecuniary income in the definition of income. They also specifically provide for the inclusion of board, living quarters and other benefits as income. They describe how to affix a value to board, living quarters and other benefits received from employment. \nNot all income that arises out of employment is received in the form of money (i.e. in a pecuniary form). The payment can also be non-pecuniary, meaning that the compensation consists of, or is measured in, something other than money.\nNon-pecuniary income received by a claimant from an employer or any other person, is included in the definition of income (Digest 5.3.2). It also includes any non-pecuniary items received by a self-employed claimant from a customer or a client.\nNon-pecuniary income includes the value of board; living quarters; heat, light, telephone, or other benefits included with those living quarters; any other benefits received in respect of employment; or any considerations furnished by an employer. The meaning of a consideration furnished by an employer as non-pecuniary income could be an item furnished or provided by an employer to an employee as payment for services rendered. For example, an automobile that the employee may use for personal use as well as for business (CUB 25241A).\nNon-pecuniary income received from an employer may be considered an employment-related benefit, in some cases. Examples of employment-related benefits as a consideration furnished by an employer are: appliances such as a refrigerator, washer and dryer (CUB 25101); the amount by which the rent was reduced (CUB 68316; CUB 20684); free meals; and free attendance at a course in exchange for services performed (CUB 23722).\nThe claimant and the employer should agree on a reasonable value of the board, living quarters and any other non-pecuniary benefits. If the claimant and the employer disagree on the value, or the value appears unreasonable, the value must be determined by the Commission. The Commission's determination of the value of living quarters must be based on the rental rates for similar accommodation in the same vicinity or district (EIR 35(14)). However, the Commission cannot affix a dollar amount for wages or salary, when the claimant is providing services but not receiving money or other non-pecuniary benefits (Digest 5.3.1.4).\nOften the question is not whether a payment is non-pecuniary, but whether it arises out of employment (Digest 5.3.1). When a non-pecuniary benefit arises out of employment, it is earnings to be deducted from EI benefits.\nA written contract of employment is not required in order for non-pecuniary benefits or considerations to be income arising out of employment. It is sufficient to show that the claimant is receiving non-pecuniary income or considerations from self-employment or under an express, implied or other contract of employment (EIR 35(1)). In a barter situation, although there is no money exchanged for services rendered, the value of the items exchanged is still considered income (Digest 5.3.1.1). Conversely, the value of free accommodation is not income when the services provided by a claimant are of a volunteer or benevolent nature. In this situation, there is no requirement that the claimant perform services. There is no employment and therefore, no income for the purposes of the regulations (Digest 5.3.1.4). In addition, the value of a personal gift from an employer is not income, as it does not arise out of employment (Digest 5.3.1.5).",0.95048004

This extra money can come in the form of a higher wage or salary, or it can be given as a one-time payment. Employers offer this additional payment to attract workers to places that might be harder to live in or not as popular. The purpose of this allowance is to help employees deal with the higher cost of living in these areas. It's important to note that this extra money is not meant to cover any specific expenses. 

This kind of allowance is sort of like when an employer considers the high living costs of a certain area when deciding how much to pay their employees. Whether the extra money is given as part of the regular pay or separately as an allowance, it counts as income. It's necessary to include this additional money when calculating the total income earned.

Overall, any added allowance for living in hard-to-reach or isolated areas cannot be treated as a deductible expense.

220,220,220,"An employer can repay employees for expenses they have had to pay for work purposes. This repayment can happen before, during, or after the expense was made or the service was provided. The repayment can be in the form of paying for the actual cost, a set amount like a daily allowance, or a monthly sum. 

For example, a daily allowance can cover expenses like meals and incidentals when an employee is out of town working for their employer. Whether the payment from the employer is considered income depends on whether it's seen as profit or a benefit. If the expense was needed for the job, then reimbursing that isn't seen as gaining profit, so it's not considered income.

Expenses that an employer can repay include things like daily allowances for accommodation and food when an employee is away for work, buying tires for a company vehicle, moving costs due to changing work locations, purchasing things needed for entertaining clients, or attending work-related training courses. These expenses are not for the employee's personal gain but rather to cover costs they wouldn't have if they weren't working for the employer.

But not all expenses repaid by an employer are work-related. Sometimes employers repay for things that are not directly connected to work, like extra medical or dental insurance, or memberships for personal recreation like a golf club. In these cases, the repayment is considered income.

'Required considerations' are items the employer needs the employee to provide to do their job. For example, a delivery driver might need to supply their own vehicle, or a ranch hand might need to have a horse. This kind of repayment is not a payment for the work itself but to help with the extra costs of providing the necessary items for the job.

If an employer repays an employee for a bus pass but the employee doesn't need it for work travel, that wouldn't be considered a 'required consideration'. This repayment is seen as an employment-related benefit and counts as income.

Employers usually ask for some form of proof - like receipts - when repaying employees for job-related expenses or required considerations. This helps to show that the expenses were real or the work was done. When employers give a fixed amount, they've already taken into account the average costs the employee might have.",62.02986477528836,9.798242078748512,12.670367459663948,13.69794511467586,11.274194617526184,10.568967254408054,46.58743205621106,5.368421052631579,0.8264155156082578,0.8264701541732339,2.65803486528228,0.4168076409584131,0.4786206022420624,0.0572578437005147,4.72544080604534,4.0,2.555713236210277,20.894736842105264,20.0,8.16858382908893,1.4609571788413098,1.0,0.8040277014915871,397,168,0.4231738035264483,1947,19,5.3.3.1,Expenses or considerations specifically compensated by an employer,Chapter 5 - Earnings,"An employer may specifically or directly compensate expenses or considerations. The reimbursement may occur before, at the time of, or after the expense was incurred or the consideration was supplied. The compensation may take the form of a payment for actual costs incurred; a fixed amount or flat rate such as a per diem; or a monthly allowance. A per diem is a daily allowance to cover daily expenditures incurred by an employee while performing duties for the employer. For example, a set daily amount to cover meals and incidentals, while out of town performing duties for the employer. \nWhether any compensation paid by an employer is income, depends on whether it is considered a gain or a benefit (Digest 5.3.2). If the expense or consideration was required of the employee to perform their job, reimbursement for that expense or consideration cannot be said to be a gain or a benefit, as the employee did not profit. As such, the amount received as compensation for the job-related expense or the job-required consideration is not considered income.\nA job-related expense is an expense incurred while engaged in activities on behalf of an employer. Job-related expenses that may be compensated by the employer include:\nper diem allowances covering accommodation and meal costs while away from the work area on business\na tire purchased by the employee for a company vehicle\nmoving costs incurred during a transfer from one work site to another\na golf club membership required to entertain clients, or\njob-related training courses\nNone of these expenses represent a gain for the employee, nor are they paid to compensate for any work performed by the employee. They are meant to pay for expenses that the employee would not have incurred if they were not engaged in activities on behalf of the employer.\nNot all expenses compensated by an employer are job-related expenses. An employer may reimburse an expense incurred by the employee as an employment-related benefit. An example of this may occur where an employer reimburses the cost of additional medical or dental insurance purchased by the employee, or a golf club membership purchased for recreation. In these situations, the employer is not compensating for business-related expenses that would not have occurred had it not been for the job duties or activities. As such, amounts reimbursed for these types of non-employment-related expenses are included as part of income (Digest 5.3.2.2).\nA job-required consideration is an item required by an employer, to be supplied by an employee in order to perform the employee's job duties. Some job-required considerations compensated by the employer may be a vehicle supplied by a pizza delivery driver or a courier; or a horse supplied by a ranch hand as required by some ranchers. Payments for job-required considerations are not to compensate for the work performed by the employee, but rather to reimburse them for the extra costs incurred in having to supply an item required to perform the duties of their employment.\nNot all considerations supplied by an employee that are compensated by an employer, are job-required considerations. If an employer pays for a bus pass that the employee purchased, where no business travel is required of the employee, this would not be considered a job-required consideration. It is an employment-related benefit and is income.\nThe Commission does not require receipts when an employer compensates an employee for job-related expenses or job-required considerations. Generally, when reimbursing employees for expenses incurred, employers require sufficient proof to justify the expenditure. This proof may be that the actual expenditure was incurred, or simply that the activity was performed. When paying a fixed amount or a flat rate, the employer has already taken into consideration the costs on average that the employee would reasonably incur under the circumstances.",0.9819901
221,221,221,"The tax law, EIR 35(10)(a)(i) & (ii), allows people who are employees (not self-employed) to deduct job-related expenses from their income if the employer doesn't pay for them. This deduction is possible if the expense is directly related to the job and if it's something the employee had to pay for in order to do their work.
Job-related expenses are costs that come up while working on behalf of the employer, like business travel or buying equipment needed for the job. To claim these expenses, employees need to show receipts. These expenses are subtracted from the total income before taxes are calculated.
However, if the expenses are for personal reasons and not directly related to the job, like childcare or commuting, they can't be deducted. But in certain situations where there are additional costs due to unusual work requirements or tasks, those costs could be deducted.
If employees have to pay others to do their job duties for them, those wages can also be deducted as long as they can prove the payments were made. But if the employer already pays a set amount that should cover these costs, no extra deductions are allowed. Similarly, costs for items that employers typically provide (like tools for tradespeople) can't be claimed, but expenses related to using those tools can be.
In summary, employees can deduct job-related expenses that their employer doesn't cover from their income before taxes, but personal expenses or costs for items usually provided by employers cannot be deducted.",63.62752387690131,10.188744251857091,12.079253325248375,13.54778917580474,12.537265652635304,10.754396887159531,49.04457021577644,6.0,0.8298387348651886,0.8616659310128953,3.1695637984118306,0.7216727069496957,0.4591944577967667,0.0643269589881275,4.7315175097276265,4.0,2.4371274698234635,23.363636363636363,25.0,7.010028235875273,1.4124513618677044,1.0,0.6841170731777715,257,127,0.4941634241245136,1267,11,5.3.3.2,Expenses and considerations not specifically compensated by an employer,Chapter 5 - Earnings,"EIR 35(10)(a)(i) & (ii) provide for the deduction of expenses and considerations from income arising out of employment, for someone who is not self-employed.\nWhen the employer does not reimburse an expense or cost, it is still possible for the claimant to deduct these expenses from their gross income, if the expenses were incurred for the direct purpose of earning that income (EIR 35(10)(a)). However, the expense must somehow relate to the terms and conditions of employment or to the employees' performance of duties (that is, it must be a job-related expense).\nThe purpose of EIR 35(10) is to allow for deductions from income when claimants have incurred job-related expenses to earn their income, or supplied job-required considerations, and their employer did not compensate them for that expense or consideration. A job-related expense is an expense that is incurred while engaged in activities on behalf of the employer. A job-required consideration is an item that an employer requires the employee to supply in order to perform their job duties.\nEmployees may have to cover business expenses out of their wages, salary or commissions that are not reimbursed by the employer. Payments may be made by employees for items such as: hotels, meals and transportation costs when performing duties for the employer away from home; gasoline purchases; entertaining current or prospective customers; or the purchase of equipment that enables them to perform their duties. In all cases where a claimant requests a deduction of a job-related expense from income, receipts must be provided. Job-related expenses supported by proof are deducted from the claimant's gross income before earnings are allocated.\nEmployees may incur expenses for personal well-being or personal circumstances in the normal course of their employment duties. These expenses or costs are generally incurred only indirectly for the purpose of earning income. They are not related to the terms and conditions of the employment, or to the employees' performance of duties. As a result, they cannot be deducted from the gross income. Examples of this type of expense are childcare or transportation to and from work (CUB 16269). However, if employees incur an expense such as childcare, for example, while performing activities that are outside the normal requirements of the employment, and are not compensated by the employer, it may be deducted from their income. Having to work overtime or to go out of town once or twice a year are examples of situations where these activities may be part of the normal requirements of the employment.\nShould the claimant expend more than the amount for which the employer compensates, this amount may be deducted from the wages or salary, provided the expense incurred is reasonable, supported by evidence, and was actually expended. In cases where the employer pays a flat rate or a fixed amount, this payment already takes into account the fluctuation in the expenses that an employee will incur. Unless special circumstances are demonstrated, a deduction for the additional amount expended is not allowed.\nWhen no amount is paid specifically to compensate for a consideration supplied, or the amount is inadequate compared to what employers normally pay, the value of a job-required consideration not compensated can be deducted from the gross income. This is true as long as employers customarily compensate this consideration in that occupation or industry. For instance, no deduction can be made for the tools that are customarily supplied by tradespersons, or for chain saws normally provided by persons employed in cutting lumber. However, it may be possible to deduct expenses incurred to operate them. The claimant's declaration as to the value of the consideration supplied is normally sufficient, if it is reasonable.\nA claimant working under a contract of employment may incur costs by engaging someone to assist in performing their job duties or to replace them when they do not work. However, as the contract of employment is with the claimant, any payment for wages or salary under that contract is part of the claimant's entire income arising out of employment. The person actually performing the duties is not the one employed by the claimant's employer, as no contract of employment exists between the employer and that person. As such, if the employer does not reimburse the wages of the person who actually performed the work, it may be possible for the claimant to deduct those wages. If the claimant can establish that moneys were actually paid to someone else to perform the claimant's duties, these moneys are expenses directly incurred in order to earn the income, and may be deducted from their income.",0.98957473

224,224,224,"A relief grant is help given to ease a difficult situation, like when someone is in really bad circumstances, a serious emergency, or a disaster. This help can be money or things instead of money. Relief grants can come from different places like the government, charities, or even an employer. It could be a one-time payment for a special problem, like a family emergency, or regular help if someone doesn't earn enough money to cover their basics. Getting a relief grant doesn't count as normal earnings, even if you have to do something in return for it. 

When deciding if something is a relief grant, you should think about a few things like how rare or unusual the situation is, if the money is given out of sympathy, or if there is a clear connection between the problem and the help received. Sometimes, figuring out if help from an employer is a relief grant can be tricky because it's related to work. In these cases, you should consider if the help is specifically for a personal problem or disaster, if the person needs to do something for the employer to get the help, and if the employer freely gives the help without any obligations.

Hardship includes, but is not restricted to, circumstances of personal destitution, emergency, or disaster. Hardship may also include the broader circumstance of financial or other difficulty, which does not necessarily amount to destitution, emergency or disaster (FCA A-597-94, CUB 25472).\nA relief grant is usually monetary, but sometimes may be non-pecuniary. It can be received from a federal, provincial or municipal authority; a charitable organization; a welfare agency; an employer; or other persons. A relief grant may be a one-time payment made for a special situation, such as where an individual encounters a family emergency or disaster, or it can be an ongoing payment from a welfare agency because the claimant's income is insufficient to meet basic needs. Payments that are in the nature of relief grants are not earnings. This is so even if the payment is non-pecuniary, or the claimant is required to perform work as a condition to receive that payment.\nFollowing are factors that may be considered when determining whether a payment constitutes a relief grant (FCA A-597-94, CUB 25472):\n\nthe simple presence of hardship does not automatically qualify moneys as a relief grant\na payment is more likely to be a relief grant if the circumstances giving rise to it are unusual or rare\nthe fact that a situation may be sympathetic does not alone mean that moneys paid constitute a relief grant\nthe link between the loss suffered and the compensation offered must be considered\nthe nature of the connection to employment must be examined, and\nconsideration of whether the payment is made voluntarily, or if there is a legal obligation to make it\n\nRelief grants originating from an employer are not as easily identified, due to the connection with employment. Therefore it is important to examine the true nature of the payment:\n\nwhether the purpose of the payment is to assist in a personal situation or a disaster\nwhether the payment is conditional on the recipient providing some sort of service to the employer for the assistance, and\nwhether the assistance is freely given by the employer, without any legal obligation\n\nAn example of a relief grant is an employer freely giving monetary assistance to an employee whose house has burnt down and does not expect any additional service from the employee for the assistance.",0.9800497
225,225,225,"Sometimes when a person is getting money from EI (Employment Insurance) because they are not working, they might also get extra money from their employer to make up for what they used to earn.

However, there are rules that say sometimes this extra money will not be counted as earnings. This helps the employee keep up their standard of living when they are not working and helps the employer keep their skilled workers when there is a temporary lay-off.

These rules apply to two types of extra payments that are not counted as earnings. The first type is when an employer gives extra money to an employee who is not working temporarily because of reasons like no work available, training, illness, injury, or quarantine. The second type is when an employer or someone else gives extra money to an employee because of things like being pregnant, taking care of children, taking care of a seriously ill family member, or a mix of these reasons.

However, the Commission has recognized the benefit of such payments which have advantages for all parties. It helps the employee maintain a standard of living during a period of unemployment, and it may help the employer maintain a skilled work force during a period of temporary lay-off. As a result, the Commission has made regulations that exempt these types of payments from being considered earnings under certain circumstances. This does not mean that a claimant who is laid off and receiving supplemental payments from their employer is exempt from the requirement to be available for, and making efforts to find, other suitable employment (Digest 10.8.1). \nTwo types of payments intended to supplement EI benefits, have been specifically excluded from consideration as earnings.

228,228,228,"When your wages or salary increase, it means you will be getting more money for your work. This can happen if your employer decides to pay you more for your job. Sometimes, this increase is given to you later, looking back to when you started working. This retroactive increase in pay is not counted as part of your regular earnings. However, it may affect how much money you receive from Employment Insurance (EI) because it could be seen as insurable. 

A retroactive increase in pay is different from a retroactive adjustment in pay. An adjustment is when you are paid the correct amount that was supposed to be given to you initially for the work you did. This could be due to a mistake by your employer, a disagreement over your pay rate, or a condition that needs to be met before you get paid correctly. 

For example, substitute teachers might get a retroactive pay adjustment after working for more than twenty days. The adjustment ensures they receive the correct pay for their work. When this type of payment is made, it will be included in the time period when you actually receive the money. If you are already working when you receive the adjustment, your pay won't change. But if you are unemployed when you get the adjustment, it will affect the week you last worked. Your EI benefit might need to be recalculated based on this new payment.

This implies that an amount was added to the previous wages or salary, therefore resulting in a newly agreed rate of pay for the work performed. Often an increase of salary is given retroactively. This may be the case when workers continue to perform their duties at their former rate of pay while a new contract is negotiated. When the contract is finally signed and there is a new agreement that includes an increased salary, that new salary is often effective at an earlier date. In this case, payment must be made retroactively to compensate for the difference in pay under the old contract, and the increased salary under the new contract. In other cases, an employer may unilaterally give an increase in salary that may also be retroactive. These retroactive increases in wages or salary are specifically excluded from consideration as earnings during the benefit period and for interruption of earnings purposes, as they are considered to have been earned over the period worked (EIR 35(7)(d)).  However, these earnings could have an impact on the calculation of the amount of the claimant's weekly EI benefit because they may be insurable.\nA retroactive increase in wages or salary must be differentiated from a retroactive adjustment of wages or salary, which is considered to be earnings. A retroactive adjustment is a payment that is made to adjust the wages or salary so it reflects a salary that was already in place at the time that the work was performed. It is made to bring the employee's salary to the pay level that was in existence at the time the work was performed, but for some reason was not paid. This late payment may be due to a mistake or a delay by the employer; a disagreement between the employer and the employee as to the applicable rate of pay for the duties performed; or it could be due to an agreed condition that must be met before a higher rate of pay becomes applicable. \nFor instance, substitute teachers may have their salary retroactively adjusted to the first day worked after having worked more than twenty days. Other situations may involve an employee who wins a grievance regarding the applicable salary for the work that was performed. In all of these situations, the adjustment of salary is not the result of a new agreement between the employer and the employee as to the rate of pay that must be paid for the work performed. In the case of a grievance, the settlement does not constitute a new work agreement, but rather a clarification of the original one. \nFor the purposes of determining a claimant's benefit rate, a retroactive pay adjustment or increase is included in the pay period in which it is paid (EIR 23(1)(b)). If the payment is made after the claimant has returned to work, the benefit rate will not be adjusted as the earnings will be allocated to the period in which they are paid. Should the claimant be unemployed at the time of the payment, the earnings will be allocated to the last week in which the claimant had earnings (EIR 23 (1.1)). The benefit rate may need to be recalculated. For purposes of allocation of earnings to be deducted from EI benefits, the retroactive pay adjustment would be allocated to the period for which it is paid (period worked), and generally not to weeks during which EI benefits are claimed. However, if the claimant was or is in receipt of benefits during the period for which the pay adjustment is paid, the adjustment will be deducted from benefits.",0.9953434

Earnings are allocated weekly, starting from Sunday. If a shift covers Saturday and Sunday, the earnings are divided between the two weeks based on hours worked. If earnings don't match a calendar week, they are proportionally allocated. Dollar amounts are rounded up to the next dollar if it's 50 cents or more.

EIR 36 describes the manner of allocating earnings, and the period to which they are allocated. Earnings from different employments are considered independently from one another, and may be allocated for the same weeks.\nWhen earnings are not allocated based on a claimant's normal weekly earnings, they are allocated to the applicable weeks, regardless of any other earnings allocated to those same weeks, whether from the same or different employments. This concurrent allocation may result in the earnings from separate employments in a week, exceeding the claimant's normal weekly earnings.\nWhen an allocation is based on normal weekly earnings, it takes into account all earnings from that employment during a specific period (Digest 5.6.3.1). This results in the total amount of earnings allocated from a particular employment, not exceeding the claimant's normal weekly earnings in any week. Allocation of the total of all earnings from the same employment using normal weekly earnings results in a consecutive rather than concurrent allocation of these earnings.\nWhen more than one type of earnings must be allocated, some earnings may be based on normal weekly earnings, whereas others are not.  In these cases, the earnings that are not allocated based on normal weekly earnings are allocated first. Then any earnings from the same employment that are based on normal weekly earnings are allocated, topping-up the first allocation from the same employment, to the normal weekly earnings from that employment in each week. This is a consecutive allocation. There is an exception for pension earnings, which are not taken into account in the allocation of other earnings from the same or other employment (EIR 36(16)).\nAll earnings are allocated on a weekly basis (EIR 36(1)). A week for benefit purposes always begins on Sunday (EIA 2(1)). The amount of earnings allocated to a week will determine the amount to be deducted from benefits for that week (EIA 19).\nShifts that start on Saturday and end on Sunday overlap two weeks. As wages are allocated to the period for which the services are performed, earnings that overlap Saturday and Sunday are allocated to two different weeks based on the hours worked in each week (EIR 36(4)).\nEarnings are not always payable for a period that coincides with a calendar week. When this occurs, the earnings are allocated for the number of days worked in a week, proportionate to the number of days worked in the entire period of the payment (EIR 36(3)).\nAn allocation can only be made in dollars. Therefore, when the amount of earnings to be allocated to a week includes a fraction of a dollar, fifty cents ($0.50) or more is rounded up to the next dollar and, less than fifty cents is rounded down (EIR 36(20)).\nThe manner in which income is treated under any other legislation, such as the Income Tax Act, may differ from that under the EIA. For example, termination moneys paid in one year, may be deemed income for that year under the Income Tax Act, but for EI benefit purposes, are allocated on a claim in the previous year, from the week of separation. However, each legislation has its own purpose and provisions. Other legislations do not take precedence over the EI legislation (FCA A-999-96, CUB 35986; CUB 68677). Even within the EI legislation, allocation for insurability and premium purposes, and allocation of earnings for benefit payment purposes, are made under two different regulations and as a result, one cannot take precedence over the other (Insurable Earnings and Collection of Premiums Regulations).",0.9924136

You can also be considered as having received payment if you are expecting to get it soon, usually on the next payday. This is common with things like wages, vacation pay, pensions, and termination pay that are paid regularly. The idea of receiving payment also applies when money is transferred directly to a retirement savings account or when it's used to pay off a debt.

To accept a payment, you usually cash a check or agree to money being deposited into your bank account. Even if you don't cash a check right away, the payment can still be considered received and accepted. This is true even when there are delays from either the employer or the person getting the money. However, if there's a dispute about the payment amount or conditions and the check is refused or sent back, it's not considered as paid.

The concept of paid combines the offer of a payment by an employer or any other person, with the receipt and acceptance of that offer by the claimant.\nReceived means to come into possession of, to acquire, or to have control of the payment. Claimants have received payment when they physically hold the cheque or cash, when payment is deposited into their bank account, or when they receive non-pecuniary income. Claimants are also considered to have received payment when it is expected to be in their possession shortly, usually the next payment processing date. This commonly occurs with wages, salary, vacation pay paid with each pay, periodic pensions and termination moneys. Received applies equally to cases where the money is transferred directly by the employer to a RRSP, or paid in fulfilment of a debt (CUB 47731; CUB 68776).\nThe claimant generally accepts an offer of payment by cashing the cheque or accepting a bank deposit.

A sum of money is said to be payable when an individual is under an obligation to pay it. This obligation to pay can be immediately due or due at some time in the future.\nEarnings are payable when the claimant is in a lawful position to enforce payment (FCA A-71-95, CUB 26456; CUB 28075). Earnings are only considered payable for EI purposes when the obligation to pay is immediate, and not when the obligation to pay is some time in the future. That is, when the claimant can access them, or when the right to receive the earnings is immediate. Any other approach may cause hardship to the claimant, as earnings that the employer has not yet paid, or may not pay for some time, would be allocated.\nThe fact that employees have acquired the right to some moneys does not mean they are immediately due. The obligation for the employer to pay these moneys may only become due at some time in the future, and the person is only able to enforce payment at that time. For example, vacation pay is not immediately due after each hour of work. It is usually due at some time in the future, such as during a vacation period, at an anniversary date, or at an entitlement date when the employee may then request the payment, according to the provisions of the contract of employment.\nWhen employees are entitled to moneys on termination, they may have the right to choose the method or time of payment. That is, one cheque at the time of separation, one cheque in the calendar year following separation, or several cheques over a period that may extend over several years. The choice of the method or time of payment governs the moment when the employer is obligated to pay and the claimant is in a position to enforce payment. Only at that time are the earnings considered payable.\nIn addition, an amount is not considered payable when the amount and condition of payment are in dispute and the cheque is refused or returned. In that case, the amount is not immediately due but rather is payable sometime in the future when the agreement between the parties is reached, as it is only then that the person is in a position to enforce payment. Likewise, an amount is not considered payable when the employer has filed for bankruptcy or is experiencing financial difficulties, and it is not expected that payment will be issued in the immediate future (Digest 4.5.3). If the payment is made at a later date by the employer, trustee, or from a governmental Wage Earner Protection Fund, it must be allocated according to the type of earnings and the reason for the payment.\nWhen the entitlement date and the employer's obligation to pay coincide, the moneys are payable on that date. In the case of vacation pay that is paid on an anniversary date, the entitlement date (i.e. the date when the employee can access the vacation pay) and the employer's obligation to pay, occur on the same date. The vacation pay is therefore payable on that anniversary date. However, where there is first an entitlement date plus an additional condition, such as the requirement for employees to request the payment of vacation pay, earnings are not payable until the additional condition is met. The employee is not in a lawful position to enforce payment until they make a request for the vacation pay. The same would be true where an employer requires employees to return to work before becoming entitled to payment (CUB 35199).",0.99244845
234,234,234,"EIR 36 has different parts that explain how to divide up different earnings in different situations. If earnings are given because someone was laid off or left their job, they should be assigned from the week they stopped working, no matter what kind of earnings they are. If the earnings aren't because of a lay-off or leaving the job, they should be divided based on the type of earnings unless a different part of the rules says otherwise. Sometimes, the name of a payment doesn't match the rules exactly, but that doesn't change the type of payment it is. For example, a bonus might actually be considered wages, a lay-off payment, or a bonus for a special event based on the rules. The period for allocating these earnings depends on their true nature. Once the time period is figured out, it needs to be checked if any other earnings have already been assigned to that time period. If more than one type of earnings is paid at the same time, each type must be allocated according to the rules, either at the same time or one after the other, depending on what the rules say.",72.33301078680205,9.287861675126903,9.516144504307135,11.88045685279188,11.32437817258883,8.517766497461924,45.43718274111676,5.125,0.8419184173856463,0.8369301756223043,2.860185840472352,0.4494710798314041,0.4279011781547278,0.0464972600090404,4.340101522842639,4.0,2.221506780426275,24.625,24.0,8.275528684017717,1.2944162436548223,1.0,0.5740755440658654,197,102,0.5177664974619289,886,8,5.6.2,Choosing the appropriate period of allocation,Chapter 5 - Earnings,"EIR 36 is divided into subsections that set out the manner of allocating different types of earnings under various situations.\nBecause EIR 36(9) is based solely on the reason for the payment, rather than the type of earnings involved, all earnings must be examined to determine the reason for their payment. If it is determined that earnings are paid or payable by reason of a lay-off or separation, they must be allocated from the week of lay-off or separation, regardless of the nature of the earnings or the period in respect of which they are purported to be paid or payable (Digest 5.6.2.1).\nIf the earnings were not paid by reason of a lay-off or separation, choosing the appropriate period of allocation is based on the type of earnings, if those earnings are specifically mentioned in another subsection of the regulation. When a specific type of earnings has not been mentioned in EIR 36, it is allocated pursuant to EIR 36(19).\nOccasionally, the name given to a payment does not match the terminology used in EIR 36. However, the name of the payment does not change the nature of the payment. For instance, what may be called a bonus may in fact represent wages, that is:\n\nearnings paid under a contract of employment for the performance of services (EIR 36(4); Digest 5.14.1, Digest 5.14.4)\na payment made by reason of a lay-off or separation (EIR 36(9); Digest 5.14.5, Digest 5.14.6), or\na bonus for a special event (EIR 36(19)(b); Digest 5.14.3)\n\nThe period to which these earnings will be allocated depends on the true nature of the earnings (Digest 5.2.0).\nOnce the period of allocation is determined, it must be reviewed to see if there are any other earnings already allocated to that period. In addition, when more than one type of earnings is paid or payable at the same time, the method of allocation for each type must be reviewed; they may be allocated concurrently, or consecutively, depending on the wording of the subsections involved.",0.9947601
235,235,235,"Any money you receive due to being laid off or leaving a job should be counted from the week when you stopped working, no matter what it's for. This includes any money you get because you lost your job, or any payments for benefits you haven't used like vacation days or sick leave. Even if you were going to get this money anyway, if you receive it when you're laid off, it's considered part of that situation.

Sometimes, when you get money at the same time you're laid off, it might not actually be related to the layoff itself. For example, if you were due to receive vacation pay around the time you were laid off, it doesn't count as being because of the layoff. In some cases, payments made when someone is laid off are actually just fixing errors in earlier payments, not compensating for the layoff.

The important thing is the reason for the payment, not the type of payment it is. So, if you're paid money because you were laid off or left a job to make up for losing it, that money is looked at differently than other types of payments. If it's not connected to being laid off, then it's counted based on what kind of payment it is.",75.15833333333336,8.738518518518521,8.841846274778883,11.266666666666666,9.91152777777778,7.112777777777779,40.2037037037037,3.888888888888889,0.8787878379225731,0.8620512655803135,3.1352488071437734,0.5725176658123668,0.4550064633592762,0.0584895652925736,4.106481481481482,4.0,2.0441322141476865,24.0,25.0,4.268749491621899,1.2685185185185186,1.0,0.5461393371503196,216,102,0.4722222222222222,933,9,5.6.2.1,Allocation of earnings that were paid or payable by reason of a lay-off or separation,Chapter 5 - Earnings,"Any earnings that are paid by reason of a lay-off or separation, to meet all the employer's obligations with respect to the lay-off or separation, must be allocated from the week of lay-off or separation, regardless of their nature. This includes any earnings paid to compensate for loss of employment, as well as any payment of outstanding entitlement to unused benefits (e.g. vacation pay; accumulated sick leave credits) paid out on separation under the terms of the contract of employment. This allocation must begin from the week of lay-off or separation, regardless of the period for which the earnings are purported to be paid or payable (EIR 36(9), Digest 5.12.0).\nEarnings paid at the time of a lay-off or separation are usually considered to be paid for that reason. However, there may be evidence that the payment simply coincides with the date of lay-off. The true reason for the payment may be something entirely different. For instance, a lay-off may coincide with an anniversary payment of vacation pay. If the vacation pay would have been paid at that time, regardless of the lay-off, then it cannot be said that the payment was made by reason of the lay-off. Payments may be merely bookkeeping activities prompted by the lay-off or separation and not truly paid to compensate for that lay-off or separation. For instance, at the time of layoff, the employer may discover that certain earnings should have been paid at an earlier date, but were overlooked. While payment was prompted by the lay-off, it was not the reason for the payment.\nEIR 36(9) regarding earnings by reason of a lay-off or separation is not based on the type of earnings paid, but rather the reason for the payment. Therefore, regardless of the type of earnings involved, if earnings are paid or payable to the claimant by reason of a lay-off or separation  (i.e. to compensate for that separation event or to pay out any remaining benefits under the contract), they are allocated under that subsection. If the earnings are not paid or payable for these reasons, they are allocated according to the type of earnings.",0.98993975
236,236,236,"When we're figuring out when to count money as income for unemployment benefits, there are some rules to follow.

If you didn't get the money because you were laid off or quit your job, we have to look at different rules. There's something called Regulation 36 that helps us with this. It talks about different kinds of payments and when we should count them.

For example, money you got for doing work should be counted for the time when you did that work. It's pretty straightforward. But for other types of payments, we need to pay attention to what Regulation 36 says. 

If you got money to come back to work or start a job, we count it for the time you agreed to work.

If you got money from things like profit sharing, commissions, or self-employment, and it's based on your work, we count it for the time you did that work.

Payments from farming activities need a bit of calculation. If it's a big payment, it's spread out over the weeks you worked for it. If it's a small payment, it's counted for the week you received it or the weeks you worked for it, depending on what you tell us.

Money from a farming subsidy is counted for the week you got it.

If you got a settlement payment for being unfairly fired, we usually count it like you were laid off. But if there was a disciplinary issue involved, we start counting the money from the first week you were supposed to be paid for working.

Payments like sick leave or worker's comp are counted for when you were sick or got hurt. If your job gives you holiday pay for a specific date off, we count it in that week.

Pension payments are counted for when they're due. If you got it in one lump sum, we convert it to a weekly amount first.

If you're getting money from a program to help you find work while you're already working, we count it for when you're supposed to get it.",84.91912359550562,5.836831460674159,8.548686976883017,9.14247191011236,6.429073033707866,6.205730337078652,32.406741573033706,2.6,0.7901819473818729,0.7997620536221398,2.385907568892727,0.4769055585002439,0.4658448651859738,0.0674279407650693,4.025280898876405,3.0,2.1818791972078064,17.8,18.0,6.80147042925278,1.2275280898876404,1.0,0.5771156114560055,356,141,0.3960674157303371,1505,20,5.6.2.2,Allocation based on the type of earnings,Chapter 5 - Earnings,"Once it is confirmed that the earnings were not paid or payable by reason of a lay-off or separation (e.g. not to compensate for a lay-off or separation or to pay out unused entitlement to benefits under the terms of a contract), an appropriate subsection of the regulation must be identified. EIR 36 refers to the allocation of specific types of earnings, as well as the reason for payment. If the specific type of earnings is mentioned in the regulation, earnings are allocated according to the relevant subsection (EIR 36(4) to 36(18)). If the specific type of earnings is not mentioned, earnings are allocated pursuant to EIR 36(19); the section used when none of the other subsections apply. Wages or salary for the performance of services are always allocated to the period where services were performed (EIR 36(4); Digest 5.7.1).\nAlthough there are a number of types of earnings that are payable under a contract of employment without the performance of services, if a type of earnings has been specifically mentioned elsewhere in the regulation, allocation is under that subsection rather than the more general one. When a payment is made under a contract of employment without the performance of services, these earnings are allocated to the period for which they are payable (EIR 36(5); Digest 5.7.2).\nWhen a payment is made in consideration of a claimant's returning to work or commencing work with an employer, these earnings are allocated to the period for which they are payable (EIR 36(5); Digest 5.7.0). These earnings are not payable until the claimant meets the condition of returning to work or commencing work with that employer. As such, the earnings are allocated to the week in which the claimant meets the condition.\nEarnings from participation in an employer's profits (profit sharing), on the basis of a commission, or through self-employment are other types of earnings that are specifically mentioned (EIR 36(6), EIR 36(6.1), EIR 36(6.2); Digest 5.15.0, Digest 5.8.0, Digest 5.16.0). Earnings that fall into these categories and arise from the performance of services are allocated to the week or weeks in which the services were performed.\nWhere the earnings arise from a transaction, including farming transactions, the earnings are allocated as follows:\n\nif the amount of the transaction occurring in a week is greater than the maximum yearly insurable earnings divided by 52, the earnings are allocated to the week or weeks when the work that gave rise to the transaction was performed, in a manner that is proportional to the amount of work that was performed during each of those weeks. If no work was performed, then the earnings arising from the transaction are allocated to the week of the transaction only\nif the amount of the transaction occurring in a week is less than or equal to the maximum yearly insurable earnings divided by 52, the earnings are allocated to the week the transaction occurred, unless the claimant indicates that the work was performed in more than one week. If that is the case, the earnings are allocated to the weeks when the work that gave rise to the transaction was performed, in a manner that is proportional to the amount of work that was performed during each of those weeks\n\nEarnings arising from self-employment in farming, received in the form of a subsidy, are allocated to the week in which the subsidy is paid (EIR 36(7)).\nEarnings received following the settlement of a wrongful dismissal complaint are generally not allocated based on their nature or type. They are allocated as earnings paid by reason of lay-off or separation, that is, based on the reason for their payment (EIR 36(9); Digest 5.6.2.1, Digest 5.12.11). However, where there is a finding or admission of discipline against the employee and the earnings are awarded to specific weeks under the settlement, these earnings are handled in a different manner. The allocation starts from the first week for which the earnings are awarded, based on normal weekly earnings. However, no earnings are allocated to any weeks during a period of suspension without pay (EIR 36(11)).\nThe following payments are allocated to the period for which they are paid or payable (EIR 36(12)):\n\npayments for sick, maternity and parental leave (EIR 36(12)(a))\nsickness or disability payments made under a group wage-loss indemnity plan (EIR 36(12)(b); Digest 5.11.2)\nprovincial motor-vehicle accident insurance payments where EI is not taken into account (EIR 35(2)(d); EIR 36(12)(c); Digest 5.11.4)\npayments made by provincial governments for the withdrawal of services as a preventative measure (EIR 35(2)(e); EIR 36(12)(c); Digest 5.11.5), and\nworkers' compensation payments, other than lump sum or pension paid in full or final settlement of a claim for workers' compensation payments (EIR 36(12)(d); Digest 5.11.3)\n\nHoliday pay for a day of leave that is a designated day recognized by law, custom, or agreement is always allocated to the week in which that day occurs (EIR 36(13)).\nPension earnings paid periodically, or in a lump sum, are allocated to the period for which they are payable (EIR 36(14); EIR 36(15); Digest 5.13.5). When the payment is made in a lump sum, it must first be converted to a weekly amount ((EIR 36(17); Digest 5.13.6).\nEarnings that are payable to a claimant under a government program intended to encourage re-employment and that are payable to the claimant as a supplement to earnings arising from a contract of employment, are allocated to the period for which they are payable (EIR 36(18)).",0.90504754

This payment is neither paid by reason of a lay-off or separation, nor is it paid for work performed. This type of earnings, a gratuitous payment, is not specifically mentioned in any other subsection.

238,238,238,"Earnings are how much money someone makes from their job each week. This is usually the regular amount of money they earn. It could be a set amount agreed upon with their employer, or it could be calculated by multiplying their hourly wage by the number of hours they work. Extra money like commissions, vacation pay, and bonuses might also be included in their earnings. 

Some benefits like life insurance or special vacation pay are not counted in their regular earnings. But sometimes, these benefits can be included if they are a big part of the total money they make from their job.

Changes in pay, like extra hours worked or working fewer hours than normal, can also affect weekly earnings. If these changes happen often enough, they become the new normal earnings. The amount of money earned each week might be different because of the type of work someone does or the shift they work. In these cases, earnings are calculated by averaging the money made over a period of time.

If someone is paid a set amount for a specific time period instead of by the hour or week, their weekly earnings are determined by dividing that amount by the number of weeks in the contract. 

When applying for benefits, people can report their earnings. If their reported earnings are close to what is calculated from their records at work, their report is usually accepted. But if there is a big difference, more investigation might be needed.

Normal weekly earnings are the ordinary, usual earnings that a claimant earns on a regular basis at that employment (CUB 65565; FCA A-841-96, CUB 35026).\nGenerally, normal weekly earnings consist of the most recent gross weekly salary upon which the employer and the claimant have agreed (CUB 35855). Where the employee is paid an hourly rate, normal weekly earnings are calculated by multiplying the number of hours normally worked by the hourly rate of pay. The gross weekly salary agreed upon may also include compensation in addition to basic wages, such as commissions paid at regular intervals, vacation pay and holiday pay paid with each pay, northern allowance, car allowance and regular shift premiums.\nFringe benefits that the claimant enjoys during employment are not included in the normal weekly earnings (CUB 65565). Such fringe benefits, which are not included in normal weekly earnings, may include life insurance benefits, long-term service awards, vacation pay that is not paid periodically, and an annual incentive allowance (FCA A-841-96, CUB 35026). However, fringe benefits may be included in normal weekly earnings when allocating earnings on separation if the calculation of the amount of compensation paid by the employer is clearly based on the fringe benefits as well as the wages (Digest 5.12.10; CUB 24992).\nOvertime, shift premiums, incentive or cost-of-living bonuses, irregular commissions, or other similar moneys, may occasionally increase the claimant's weekly salary. As well, the weekly salary may be reduced when the claimant works fewer hours than agreed, or temporarily works shifts for which a premium is not paid. When this increased or decreased weekly salary occurs so often that it is considered normal, it becomes the claimant's normal weekly earnings (CUB 63865). Normal may be considered as what has repeatedly occurred in 85 per cent of the weeks used to calculate the benefit rate. If this increased or reduced weekly salary varies from week to week, normal weekly earnings become the average of the increased or reduced weekly salary of the weeks under study.\nThe gross weekly salary may vary because of the pattern of work. For example, the pattern of work may require a different number of hours to be worked in each week or a different shift premium may be applicable in each week. In addition, the work pattern may include alternating weeks on and off work, or, a person may work additional hours in a week in order to earn days off. In these cases, normal weekly earnings are determined by averaging the gross weekly salary over the weeks of the work pattern.\nWhere there is a contract, which specifies a time period and a specific sum paid for the total period rather than an hourly or weekly wage, normal weekly earnings are determined by dividing the amount over the number of weeks of the contract period. In these situations, the actual number of hours worked in any given week is not relevant for determining normal weekly earnings.\nClaimants' declarations as to their weekly earnings are accepted at face value unless these amounts do not appear reasonable, or there is clear evidence to the contrary.\nAs long as the amount reported as normal weekly earnings by the claimant on the application for benefits, is within 10% or $75 of the average weekly insurable earnings calculated from the ROE (excluding moneys paid on termination), the claimant's statement will be accepted. If the difference is greater than 10% of the amount reported by the claimant, or $75, further fact finding may be required. However, in some cases, a difference of more than 10% or $75 could still be accepted based on the claimant's circumstances or local labour market knowledge.",0.91213024

Earnings from a different employer are not considered as earnings from that employment.\nAs long as a lay-off or separation from the employment giving rise to the earnings legitimately occurs, or the right to the payment legitimately occurs under a contractual provision, earnings from any subsequent employment with the same employer are not used in determining the normal weekly earnings to be used for allocation purposes. Termination moneys paid or payable before a claimant actually ceases work with an employer must be carefully examined to determine exactly what is giving rise to the payment and why they are paid or payable at that time.\nWhen a trustee is appointed to continue the operations of an employer in bankruptcy, it is considered to be subsequent employment and not that employment. As a result, earnings for work performed for the trustee are not taken into account when allocating any earnings paid or payable by reason of a lay-off or separation, by the trustee or a Wage Protection Fund, on behalf of the bankrupt employer (FCA A-397-08, CUB 70719).\nIn the case of an allocation of vacation pay that is paid or payable to a claimant by reasons other than a lay-off or separation from an employment, the term that employment refers to the employment that triggered the payment of the vacation pay.\nIn the case of earnings awarded to specific weeks after a finding or admission of discipline, that employment referred to is the one from which the claimant was suspended (EIR 36(11)).\nIf an allocation is required at the rate of normal weekly earnings, the allocation period must be reviewed to see if there are any other earnings applicable to that same period, from the same employment that triggered the earnings being allocated. Any earnings from employment other than the employment that gave rise to the amount being allocated, are not considered when determining the amount to be allocated to each week as normal weekly earnings.",0.89020056
240,240,240,"This text explains how earnings are allocated to different time periods. It mentions that earnings from work should be assigned to the weeks when the work was done. For self-employed individuals, earnings should be allocated based on when the work was performed. It also talks about how vacation pay, lay-offs, and separations from work affect earnings allocation. 

The text explains that various types of payments, like sick leave or workers' compensation, should be allocated to the period when they were paid. It also discusses how pension earnings are managed, both if they are paid periodically or as a lump sum. 

Lastly, it states that if none of the previous rules apply, earnings from work should be assigned to the period in which the services were performed, and earnings from business transactions should be allocated to the week of the transaction.

241,241,241,"When you work for someone else, you are usually under a contract called a contract of service or employment. This contract can be either written down or just understood based on how people act. If it's written, it could be a detailed agreement, a simple note, or just an agreement between you and your boss, or a mix of written and spoken promises. No matter how it's done, both the employer and employee know what's expected. The laws of where you work also have rules about how employees should be treated and paid.

Income from working under a contract is normally considered earnings that count for benefits, but some types of income don't count for benefits. Depending on how you're paid, the terms of your contract or any union agreement can affect what is included as earnings.

A contract of service may be express or implied. Under an express contract, an employer and employee enter into an actual written or verbal agreement regarding the terms of employment. On the other hand, an implied contract is one that is  presumed, based on the act or conduct of the parties. An implied contract may arise where one party, without being requested to do so, renders services under circumstances indicating that they expect to be paid for those services, and the other party, knowing the circumstances, accepts the benefit of those services.\nAn express contract of service may be in the form of:\n\na formal written contract complete with personnel policy manuals\na simple written agreement\na verbal agreement between an employee and an employer, or\nit may contain both written and verbal elements\n\nHowever, whatever form the contract takes, the terms and conditions of the employment arrangement are set out and known by the parties involved. In addition, the labour laws of the jurisdiction where the claimant is employed may also dictate terms and conditions regarding the employment and payments to which an employee is entitled during employment, and upon loss of that employment.\nAlthough, it is the entire income arising out of a contract of employment that is determined to be earnings for benefit purposes, there are some types of income which arise out of a contract of employment which have been specifically excluded as earnings (EIR 35(2); EIR 35(7), Digest 5.5.0). Certain types of earnings arising out of a contract of employment require specific allocation methods. Therefore, it is important to identify for what the claimant is being compensated. The terms and conditions of the contract of employment, or the collective agreement, are essential in making this determination.\nUnder a contract of employment, claimants may be compensated for the performance of services or may receive compensation without being required to directly perform services  (Digest 5.7.1; Digest 5.7.2). Where the specific compensation is not directly for the performance of services, the right to the compensation may arise from services that the claimant has performed in the past or through agreeing to be available for work with that employer.

Remuneration under a contract of employment for the performance of services is part of the entire income arising out of any employment (EIR 35(2); Digest 5.3.0). It includes those moneys that are paid for the services that an employee provides to an employer, such as:\n\nwages (usually on an hourly, daily or piecework basis), or salary (fixed payment at regular intervals)\nfringe benefits (Digest 5.3.2.2)\nshift bonuses and shift premiums (Digest 5.14.2)\novertime (Digest 5.7.2.3)\nstand-by hours\ncommissions\nisolation pay or northern allowances\ncall-back pay\nproduction bonuses (Digest 5.14.1), or end-of-season bonuses (Digest 5.14.4)\ntips or gratuities based on a service charge or flat rate (Digest 5.14.7), or\nprofit-sharing plans (Digest 5.15.0)\n\nHowever, retroactive increases in wages or salary are specifically excluded from consideration as earnings (Digest 5.5.3).\nIt is not necessary that earnings are actually paid before an allocation can be made; it is sufficient that they are payable (Digest 5.6.1.2). However, due to the unique nature of commission payments, commissions are allocated to the week in which the services giving rise to those earnings are performed, or to the week in which the transaction giving rise to the earnings occurred (EIR 36(6); Digest 5.8.0).\nIf the employer's pay period does not coincide with the calendar week (Sunday to Saturday), then the earnings are allocated as a fraction of the pay period, based on the number of days for which the claimant is remunerated in the week (EIR 36(2)). If paid by the hour, earnings are allocated according to the number of hours worked in each calendar week.\nShifts that start on Saturday and end on Sunday overlap 2 EI calendar weeks. As wages are allocated to the period for which services are performed, they are allocated to 2 different weeks based on the hours worked in each week.\nIt is the terms of the contract of employment that determines whether remuneration is payable specifically for the performance of services, for periods in which no services are performed, or for both.\nWorkers may be under an annual contract of employment that covers periods in which services must be performed, as well as periods in which services are not performed. If the annual contract provides that the workers are only paid for the period in which they perform services, then earnings payable under these contracts of employment are allocated only to the period in which services are performed. They are, not allocated to any period not worked and not compensated by the employer. This is true even if the claimant receives their remuneration in installments over the working and non-working periods.\nIt is not the frequency, method or timing of the payments that is critical in determining whether the payments are for the performance of services; rather it is the reason the claimant is paid.\nWages are generally paid for the number of hours or days an employee works, or for the number of units an employee produces; that is, for the services which are actually performed. Wages are allocated to the period in which the work was performed (EIR 36(4)).\nEmployees who receive a salary generally have entered into an agreement to be paid for a specific period, regardless of the number of hours they are required to work in that period. Salary payable under the terms of a contract of employment for the period of the contract is earnings for the entire period covered by the contract, even if this period includes weeks during which no services are performed. These earnings are generally spread equally over each week of the contractual period, despite the fact that the volume of work performed may vary from week to week.\nPayments made to employees who are required to be available on standby during off-duty hours may be equated to wages or salary paid for services rendered. These earnings are allocated to the period that the standby services occur. In the same way, call back pay is the wage or salary payable for being called back to work, and usually represents payment for a minimum set number of hours, regardless of the number of hours actually worked.

244,244,244,"The money you get for holidays that are set aside from work is considered part of the total money you make from your job. These holidays can be days off because of laws, customs, or agreements. The money you receive for these holidays is linked to the week when the holiday happens.

Holidays recognized by laws can be set by the government. Customs or agreements in a certain job or industry can also designate days off, either instead of or in addition to the legal holidays.

If there's a special holiday before or after time off from work, the money for that holiday is connected to the week when the holiday is scheduled, even if the employer decides to pay for the holiday later. However, if the employer and the union agree to celebrate the holiday on a different day, the money for it is tied to the week of that agreed-upon day.

In some jobs, instead of receiving a set amount for each holiday, employees might get a percentage of their regular pay. To get this holiday pay, usually, the employee needs to work the day before and after the holiday. This ensures that the employee was actually working during the holidays.

If an employee receives benefits during holidays, they may get payment retroactively for those days off. If they work on a holiday, the earnings for that day are connected to that specific day, unless the employer and the union agree to celebrate the holiday on another day.

Payments for designated holidays include those holidays or non-working days that are observed by law, custom or agreement. Designated holidays may also include any holiday or non-working day that immediately precedes or follows a holiday or non-working day. Payments received for designated holidays are allocated to the week in which the designated day occurs (EIR 36(13)).\nHolidays or non-working days observed by law include those statutory and civic holidays designated by a provincial or federal authority. Holidays or non-working days may also be designated by custom or agreement by a particular employer or industry. These designated days may be instead of, or in addition to, the required statutory and civic holidays.\nA designated holiday may fall prior to, or after a lay-off or separation, during a vacation period, or the payment may be conditional upon the claimant's return to work. Nevertheless, the allocation is to the week in which the designated holiday falls, even if the employer has agreed to delay the payment for the holiday to a time agreeable to the employer and the employee, or the employee's union (CUB 60006; FCA A-148-88, CUB 14671).\nIf the employer and the union agree to substitute a different day to observe a designated holiday, then any earnings paid for that holiday are allocated to the week in which the substituted holiday occurs because that is when, by custom or agreement, the holiday is taken. However, if there is evidence that the change was made solely to circumvent the intent of the EI legislation, such as when the day chosen is a day when no work is normally done, the earnings would be allocated to the week in which the original designated holiday occurs (EIR 36(13)).\nIn some industries, rather than giving a specific amount for each designated holiday, the designated holiday pay may be a percentage of wages paid, which is to apply to any designated holiday for which entitlement is shown. In order to be entitled to payment for a specified holiday, the employee is usually required to have worked the day before and the day after the holiday. The practical effect of this requirement ensures that the designated holidays being compensated occurred while being employed. Designated holiday pay paid as a percentage is allocated to the weeks in which the holidays occurred during the period of employment.\nA retroactive allocation may be required if the claimant was in receipt of benefits during any of the statutory or designated holidays. If there are a number of holidays, an approximate percentage will be calculated according to the number of designated holidays (CUB 67705).\nIf a claimant works on a designated holiday, the earnings received for the designated holiday are allocated to that day, in addition to their regular wages (EIR 36(4)). However, if the claimant banks the extra time worked on the holiday, to be taken or paid out at a later date, or if there is an agreement between the union and the employer to substitute a different day, the earnings would be allocated to the week in which the leave or the alternate day was taken (EIR 36(13)).",0.9617595

The contract also sets out the remuneration to which an employee is entitled if they are required to work hours in excess of, or outside of, the regular hours set out in the contract.\nEmployees may have the right, under their contract of employment, to choose how they are compensated for overtime worked. Compensation for overtime worked is not an earned benefit in addition to wages for work, as in the case of accumulated sick leave or vacation pay; it is the actual wages for the work. The worker may have the choice to be compensated in pay, or to receive the equivalent of the overtime worked as a period of leave with pay (compensatory leave). This compensatory leave may be accumulated until the employee is in a position to take the leave and the employer is in a position to allow it.\nBy choosing to accumulate the overtime hours worked to be used as paid leave at a later date, the employee and the employer have an agreement that the employee will be allowed to take leave and receive remuneration for the period of the leave, rather than receive payment when the overtime is worked. For any hour accumulated in this manner, under the contract of employment, earnings are no longer strictly payable for services performed during the period worked. Earnings under that contract of employment are now payable when regular hours are worked, and for a period of leave where services are not required. The overtime hours that are paid during an agreed period of leave are allocated to the period for which they are payable (i.e. to the period of leave granted) (EIR 36(5)). In these cases, the hours being accumulated are no longer allocated as earnings for the week in which the overtime hours were worked.\nClaimants may be unable to take their accumulated compensatory leave due to the expiry of a set time limit, or due to a lay-off or separation. In these situations, the employer is still under a contractual obligation to pay for the overtime worked, or to grant time off with pay. If the employer can no longer grant time off with pay, the employer must still pay the claimant for the overtime worked. When this payment is made, no matter whether the payment was prompted by lay-off, separation or due to an anniversary date, it is earnings payable under a contract of employment for the performance of services, and is allocated to the period in which the services were performed (i.e. when the overtime was worked) (EIR 36(4)).",0.959144

Normally, this extra money from employers would be considered income that reduces EI benefits. However, if the extra payments are part of a Supplementary Unemployment Benefit (SUB) plan that meets certain requirements, then they are not counted as income that affects EI benefits.

These SUB plans are checked nationally to make sure they meet all the rules. If a payment under a SUB plan doesn't meet all the conditions, it is counted as income and is assigned to the period when the person is unemployed.

Additional payments from employers or others to support EI benefits during times like maternity leave or caring for a family member can also be excluded from affecting EI benefits, even if they are not part of an approved SUB plan.

These supplemental payments make up most of the difference between the claimant's EI benefits and the employee's normal wages while employed.\nAs these payments are moneys arising out of employment, they would normally be earnings to be deducted from EI benefits (EIR 35(2)). However, payments made by an employer to supplement EI benefits are excluded from consideration as earnings if they are made under a Supplementary Unemployment Benefit (SUB) plan which meets specific conditions (EIR 37(2)).\nSUB plans are reviewed at the national level to determine if all required conditions are met, and a list of the SUB plans that meet the conditions is maintained.

For example, supplemental payments made by an employer or another person to supplement EI benefits during maternity, adoption, leave to care for a child, or leave for the care or support of a family member, are specifically excluded from consideration as earnings, if they meet specific criteria. These payments are not earnings if the payment, when combined with the claimants' weekly rate of EI benefits, does not exceed their normal weekly earnings from employment, and does not reduce the employee's accumulated sick leave, vacation leave, severance pay or any other accumulated credits from employment (EIR 38; Digest 5.5.2.2).",0.9938984
248,248,248,"Contracts between employers and employees determine how many hours and days employees work. Some contracts might require more hours than usual. In these cases, employees get extra benefits to make up for the longer work hours. The definition of full-time work is based on local job market info and laws in the employee's area. 

Employees are paid their normal wage for working extra hours and are given time off as compensation. This time off can be paid or unpaid and is a benefit earned in addition to wages. Sometimes employees work extra hours in a week and get time off for those extra hours. Even if they are paid the same each week, they still get that time off.

When taking time off, earnings are divided based on if it was paid time off or unpaid time off. Sometimes, employees can't take their time off and could lose it when they stop working, or if they are laid off. In that case, they might get paid for the time off they couldn't take.

The workweek in the contracts of employment for some employers or industries, may exceed the hours or days worked by full-time employees employed elsewhere. When the regular workweek of employees is in excess of the hours, days or shifts normally worked by individuals in full-time employment, these employment contracts often offer additional benefits to employees, to compensate for the increased regular workweeks (FCA A-427-14).\nThere is no formal definition of full-time employment in the EI Act or regulations. What is full-time employment is a factual determination that should be based on evidence. A determination of what constitutes the normal number of hours worked by persons in full-time employment must be made, based on local labour market information and terms of the Employment Standards Act in the claimant's province or territory of employment. \nUnder the above mentioned contracts of employment (verbal or written), employees receive their usual remuneration for the actual higher number of hours or days worked and, to compensate for working this increased regular work week, are entitled to a period of leave. This period of leave may be with or without pay. These days of leave are commonly referred to as lay days or periods of leave, and are an earned benefit in addition to wages paid for the work actually performed. This is similar to the accumulation of vacation pay.\nEntitlement to lay days or periods of leave may also occur when employees work a number of hours, days or shifts in a compressed fashion making these hours, days or shifts in excess of those worked by full-time employees in a week. As a result of this compressed work, these employees obtain leave or time off for periods they would otherwise be required to work. These employees may receive the same wage or salary each week regardless of the actual hours worked in each week.\nDue to special provisions, there is no interruption of earnings for any week or part week in which leave for a lay day or period of leave is taken, unless there was an interruption from other employment in a claimant's qualifying period (EIR 14(3); Digest 2.3.2). The claimant is also considered to have worked a full working week for any week or part week of lay days or period of leave taken (EIA 11(4); Digest 4.3.5). This is true whether, or not the claimant is paid for the lay days or period of leave.\nIf lay days or a period of leave is taken with pay, earnings payable for this leave are allocated in the same way as any earnings payable under a contract of employment without the performance of services;  to the period for which the leave is payable. If the lay days or period of leave taken is without pay, there cannot be any allocation of earnings to the leave period. In this situation, what must be examined is whether or not the weeks covered by the lay days or period of leave are considered to be weeks of unemployment.\nSometimes lay days or a period of leave cannot be taken due to a specific date being reached, a lay-off, or a separation from employment. The claimant may lose entitlement to the accumulated lay days or period of leave. If this occurs, an interruption of earnings will occur as of the date the individual stopped working, or the date they are no longer entitled to the lay days/period of leave, whichever is later. In addition, a disentitlement for working a full working week during lay days or a period of leave does not apply if there are no lay days or period of leave taken. However, if any lay days or period of leave were taken in the last week worked, those provisions may be applicable to that week, as they apply for any week or part week where lay days or a period of leave occurred.\nIf the right to paid leave for lay days or a period of leave is lost upon reaching a specific date, a lay-off, or a separation from employment, the claimant may be entitled to moneys in lieu of that paid leave. Similar to vacation leave entitlement, the paid lay days or period of leave is a benefit accumulated under the contract, which is paid out if the leave cannot be taken. These moneys are earnings arising out of employment. If these earnings are paid or payable by reason of a lay-off or separation, these earnings are allocated in the same manner as any other earnings payable by reason of a lay-off or separation (EIR 36(9); Digest 5.12.4). However, the normal weekly earnings in that case would be based on the claimant's actual workweek. If the earnings are payable because the paid leave must be used by a specific date, the allocation would be to the week in which the money in lieu of the leave became payable under the contract (EIR 36(5)).\nIf the right to lay days or a period of leave without pay is lost on reaching a specific date, a lay-off or a separation from employment, and the claimant is not entitled to moneys in lieu of that leave, there are no earnings to be allocated, the same as if the unpaid leave was already taken.",0.99029446

During deferred leave, employees do not stop earning money unless they work elsewhere during their time off. They are considered to be working full weeks during their leave time. However, if they stop working or break the agreement, they might not get paid as planned.

When employees agree to deferred salary leave, they agree to earn less when working so they can get paid the same amount during their time off.

The employee is considered an employee on paid leave for the fifth year.\nBy special provisions, employees on deferred leave do not have an interruption of earnings during their leave period, unless an interruption can be established on the basis of other employment (EIR 14(6); Digest 2.3.4). Employees on this type of leave are considered to be working full working weeks for each week of their deferred leave (EIA 11(3); Digest 4.4.4). This is not applicable if the employment terminates for some reason, and the self-funded leave agreement is broken.\nBy choosing the deferred salary leave plan, employees consent to be paid a lesser amount as salary during their period of work, so they can be paid that same salary during the period of leave.

250,250,250,"Commissions are extra money that employees can earn based on how much they sell or certain tasks they complete. This extra money usually comes from the work they do as part of their job. The money they earn in commissions is usually tied to the time when they did the work that led to the commission.

Commissions can come from either selling something or just from doing a specific task. If the total commission money from a sale is more than a certain amount allowed, it gets divided up based on when the work was done. If it's less than that amount, it usually gets assigned to the time of the actual sale.

Sometimes, employees only get the commission after a sale is completed or some other later event happens. In these cases, the commission money is tied to that event and not when they did the work. This might happen in situations like real estate sales or recruitment bonuses.

Commissions arise out of employment under a contract of service and are earnings (EIR 35(2)). \nCommissions are allocated to the period in which the services that gave rise to the right to the money, are performed (EIR 36(6)).\nCommissions may also arise from a transaction (Digest 5.16.9.1). It is the total or aggregate amount of commission earnings arising from the transaction that determines how the payment is allocated. When the total commission earnings arising from the transaction is greater than the maximum yearly insurable earnings in effect at the time of the transaction divided by 52, then the earnings are allocated proportionally to the specific weeks where the work that resulted in the transaction was performed. If no work was performed, then the earnings are allocated to the week of the transaction (EIR 36(6.1)(a)).\nWhen the total commission earnings arising from the transaction are equal to or less than the maximum yearly insurable earnings in effect at the time of the transaction divided by 52, then the earnings are allocated to the week in which the transaction occurred (EIR 36(6.1)(b)). However, if the claimant indicates that the work that gave rise to the commission earnings (resulting from the transaction) was performed in more than one week, then the earnings are allocated to the specific weeks where the work was performed, in a manner that is proportional to the amount of work performed during each of those weeks.\nTo determine how commissions will be allocated, it must be ascertained whether the right to the commission occurred due to services performed, or as a result of the completion of a transaction. A right to the commission occurs when claimants have a legal right to compel their employer to pay them; that is, when claimants have a legal actionable right to the moneys. Although in most situations of commission sales there are services performed, the right to the commission may arise from either those specific services, or from a specific transaction.\nClaimants may have an actionable right to the commission at the time of and because of the services performed. When the actionable right is because of the services performed, there is not necessarily a sale of a product, although there could be. There is an offer of services (a contract is set up between the customer and the person supplying the service), someone accepts the offer, and once the service has been performed, the commission is owed (CUB 20034, CUB 25395). The date the service is performed is usually the same as the date of the sale and it is at that time that claimants have an actionable right to the commission. Examples include hairdressers who receive a commission on their services, employees who prepare income tax returns, repairpersons who repair appliances, or piece workers. In these situations, the commissions should be allocated to the week(s) in which the services that gave rise to the commissions were performed.\nClaimants may have an actionable right to the commission only when the sale or contract is finalized. This right may occur at the time of the sale or later, or at the time the product is delivered, and is determined by the terms of the contract with the customer or employer. In these situations, claimants often spend a lot of time performing services without gaining any right to commissions. Examples are cosmetic or furniture salespersons, home or door-to-door sales of various products, or life insurance salespersons. If the finalizing of the sale or the contract (which gives the right to the commission) occurs at a different time from the time services are performed, the allocation of the commission earnings cannot be completed until after the transaction takes place (CUB 77097; CUB 67376). Whether a claimant is working a full working week or not, their availability for work may need to be considered for any period they are performing services without any income.\nSometimes, it is a later event or some other action that gives claimants the actionable right to commissions. It is the later event and not the performance of services or the time of the claimant's sale or contract with the customer, that gives them the right to the commission. For example:\nreal estate sales where the right to commissions is not reached until the sale closes and the property changes hands\ncar sales where the right to commissions is not reached until the transfer of ownership has been completed\npayments made based on the sales of people the claimant has recruited for the company\nroyalties, which are calculated as a percentage (for example, per play of a commercial) or are calculated periodically (for example, replays of a commercial), that provide for further rights to commissions\nrenewal of life insurance policies, where future anniversary dates of the renewals provide the right to subsequent commissions\nIn these situations, the allocation of earnings arising from a transaction or event is determined by the total or aggregate amount of the commission arising from the transaction. If the earnings are equal to or less than the maximum yearly insurable earnings in effect at the time of the transaction, divided by 52, they are allocated to the week of the transaction. If the earnings are greater than the maximum, then the commission earnings are allocated proportionally to the weeks in which the work that gave rise to the transaction was performed. Commission earnings that cannot be attributed to either the performance of a service or a transaction are allocated equally to each week where the money was earned (EIR 36(6.2)).",0.9220944

Employers might pay vacation money as a percentage of the employee's regular pay. This money can be either saved up and given at specific times during the year or paid along with the regular salary. 
By law, employers must give vacation pay to employees who work for them, even though not all jobs offer vacation time. The reason for vacation pay is to make sure employees still get paid when they take time off from work, even though not everyone who gets vacation pay actually takes time off. 
Employers have to pay a certain part of the employee's total wages as vacation pay. Sometimes vacation pay might be called a bonus, indemnity, or gratuity.

254,254,254,"EIR 36 is a set of rules that explain how different types of earnings should be divided in various situations. One section focuses on payments made due to a lay-off or separation. Regardless of the type of earnings or when they are supposed to be paid, this section must be used to determine if they are because of a lay-off or separation.

If the earnings are not linked to a lay-off or separation, the period for dividing them depends on the type of earnings and the regulations mentioned. For instance, vacation pay is one type of earning mentioned in the rules. If the vacation pay is not related to a lay-off or separation, how it should be divided depends on whether it is for a specific vacation period or another reason.

Vacation pay might be given for reasons like lay-off, a certain vacation period, on an anniversary, upon request, or in each pay period. Sometimes, the reason for the payment may not be clear and needs to be figured out to divide it correctly. If vacation pay coincides with a lay-off or separation, it is usually considered as being paid because of the lay-off or separation unless proven otherwise.

When figuring out how vacation pay should be divided for EI benefits, it is based on the real reason for the payment, regardless of how the income is determined for tax or insurance purposes.",59.62235185185186,10.98000411522634,12.516099999999998,14.164444444444444,11.362592592592591,8.752263374485594,50.63744855967079,6.4,0.8447244630919563,0.8881531208753586,2.78489001989002,0.4892422209841085,0.4807594770094769,0.0819933674667013,4.382716049382716,3.0,2.611629111272368,24.3,25.5,7.2532751223154355,1.448559670781893,1.0,0.7647237750983781,243,104,0.4279835390946502,1094,10,5.10.2,Allocation,Chapter 5 - Earnings,"EIR 36 is divided into subsections that set out the manner of allocating different types of earnings, under various situations. One of the subsections deals strictly with payments made by reason of a lay-off or separation. This subsection must be used regardless of the nature of the earnings and the period in respect of which they are purported to be paid or payable (EIR 36(9), EIR 36(10)). Therefore, all earnings must be examined to determine whether the reason for their payment is due to a lay-off or separation.\nWhen the earnings are not paid or payable by reason of a lay-off or separation, choosing the appropriate period of allocation is based on the specific type of earnings, and the appropriate subsection in the regulations, if the earnings are specifically mentioned.  When a specific type of earnings is not mentioned, earnings are allocated pursuant to EIR 36(19).\nOne of the types of earnings specifically mentioned in EIR 36(8) is vacation pay paid or payable for reasons other than for a lay-off or separation. When the payment is for a reason other than for a lay-off or separation, allocation depends on whether the payment is made for a specific vacation period, or for some other reason (EIR 36(8)(a) & (b)). Vacation pay is allocated weekly and is based on the claimant's normal weekly earnings (EIR 36(8), EIR 36(9), EIR 36(10); Digest 5.6.3).\nVacation pay may be paid:\n\nby reason of a lay-off or separation (EIR 36(9); Digest 5.10.3)\nfor a specific period of vacation (EIR 36(8)(a); Digest 5.10.4)\non an anniversary date (EIR 36(8)(b); Digest 5.10.5)\nat the claimant's request (EIR 36(8)(b); Digest 5.10.5), or\nincluded in every pay period (EIR 36(8)(b); Digest 5.10.5)\n\nSometimes the reason for the payment is not obvious and must be determined before allocation can occur, as the real reason for the payment may be different from the circumstances that prompted the payment. The payment of vacation pay may also coincide with another event, giving the appearance that it was made for other reasons. The real reason for the payment must be determined, as allocation is on that basis. When the payment of vacation pay coincides with the lay-off or separation, and where there is no evidence to the contrary, it is assumed that the vacation pay was paid or payable by reason of a lay-off or separation (EIR 36(9)).\nThe determination of income for income tax purposes, and earnings for insurability purposes, have no effect on the allocation of vacation pay for EI benefit purposes.",0.9981579
255,255,255,"Sometimes it's important to look at the company's rules, the union agreement, or the contract you signed when leaving a job to understand why you're getting a certain payment. When you get laid off or leave a job, any vacation time you haven't used is often turned into money and given to you. In this case, it's usually safe to say that the lay-off or separation is the reason for the payment. If that's true, the payment is categorized in a specific way according to certain rules.

But sometimes the payment might actually be for a different reason than just getting laid off. For example, it might be due to a forgotten work anniversary or a planned vacation. In these cases, the real reason for the payment needs to be figured out and then treated accordingly.

The actual date you get the payment doesn't matter. For instance, even if you receive vacation pay before you officially leave your job, it's still considered part of the separation if the reason for the payment is related to you leaving, like if the company is shutting down.

It doesn't matter when you earned the vacation pay, but what matters is why it's being paid out now. If the reason for the payment is the lay-off or separation, then it needs to be divided up and given to you weekly starting from when you left.

Along with vacation pay, any other money you receive from the same employer when you leave must also be considered. These amounts will be added together and divided among weeks as if it was your regular weekly pay. 

If you earn money from another job during the weeks you're receiving payments from your old job, that won't be factored in when dividing up your old job's payments. This means the total you receive each week might be more than what you normally earn in a week.",72.11100000000002,8.567333333333334,10.504223727775692,11.726419753086422,9.620092592592597,8.11,42.27901234567901,4.466666666666667,0.8687983240400042,0.868450063925523,2.8530366765510573,0.430776118816232,0.4085227838987879,0.0455930545401658,4.299382716049383,4.0,2.2415547105067706,21.6,19.0,7.400900846068223,1.3333333333333333,1.0,0.6431020501550125,324,142,0.4382716049382716,1456,15,5.10.3,By reason of a lay-off or separation,Chapter 5 - Earnings,"Sometimes it is necessary to examine the employer's policy, the collective agreement or the separation agreement, in order to determine the specific reason for payment. Usually, on a lay-off or separation, any unused vacation leave is converted to a monetary amount, and paid out to the employee. In these situations, the lay-off or separation has prompted the payment, and it can reasonably be assumed it is the reason for the payment. If this is the case, the vacation pay is allocated under EIR 36(9) and EIR 36(10).\nOccasionally, there may be an indication that the real reason for the payment is something other than the lay-off or separation. In other words, it may only be coincidental that the vacation pay is paid at the time of lay-off or separation whereas the real reason for the payment may be, an overlooked anniversary date or a scheduled vacation period. In these cases, the real reason for payment must be clarified, and once determined, it is allocated accordingly (FCA A-217-93, CUB 20723A; Digest 5.10.4)).\nThe date a payment is actually made is not relevant. For example, vacation pay paid before an actual separation from employment so that it does not affect entitlement to EI benefits, is still deemed to be paid in respect of the separation because the reason for the payment was, for example, a plant closure (CUB 54211). In these cases the fact that the vacation pay was paid earlier, in contemplation of the lay-off or separation, does not change the fact that it is the lay-off or separation that is the true reason for the payment. This principle applies even if the Commission erroneously advised a claimant that payment of vacation pay before separation would not affect the payment of EI benefits (CUB 56521).\nWith the exception of trust funds, it does not matter when the vacation pay was earned. Rather, what is relevant is what caused it to be immediately payable (Digest 5.10.6). If the lay-off or separation was the reason for payment, then it must be allocated from the week of the lay-off or separation (FCA A-67-02, CUB 53070; Digest 5.6.0). The regulation is not restricted to allocating only the current year balance of vacation pay but rather, any balance that is owed to the claimant.\nOnce it is determined that the vacation pay is paid or payable by reason of a lay-off or separation, it must be allocated on the basis of normal weekly earnings to consecutive weeks, commencing with the first week of the lay-off or separation (EIR 36(9)).\r\n      In addition to vacation pay, the claimant  may receive other moneys from the same employer, at the time of lay-off or separation, that must also be taken into account. Those moneys will be combined with the vacation pay, and the total will be allocated using the claimant's normal weekly earnings (Digest 5.12.4).\nIf the claimant receives earnings from another employment during the weeks of allocation, those earnings will not be taken into account when allocating the earnings from the first employment.  In these cases, the total earnings from both employments, allocated to each week, may exceed the normal weekly earnings (Digest 5.6.3.1).",0.64001846
256,256,256,"EIR 36(8)(a) talks about how vacation pay is given for a specific vacation time. This means that the pay is for a vacation time that the employer and employee have both agreed on. If there is no agreement on non-working days being part of vacation, then they are not counted as vacation time. 

If a workplace closes for a general vacation period every year, that period is considered the employee's vacation time unless there is evidence to show otherwise. Money held in trust and paid during these vacation periods, like in the Quebec construction industry, is not considered regular earnings because the money was held in trust.

When employees take vacation while still working, they usually receive their regular pay on their usual payday or just before their vacation. This regular pay is considered vacation pay for a specific time off. The amount given is based on their normal weekly earnings for the duration of their vacation.

Sometimes vacation pay is a percentage of the total earnings but is not paid in each paycheck. It might be given in a lump sum at different times during employment. Depending on what the payment is for, it may or may not be counted towards vacation pay. If the payment is for something other than vacation, like a request from the employee or a lay-off, then it's for that specific reason. 

If an employee does not prove that they were available during their vacation when they were supposed to, they may not receive their vacation pay.",63.4694475794476,9.356061776061775,12.766815935922704,13.683516483516485,10.2993762993763,9.889420849420851,45.40570240570241,5.076923076923077,0.8412338544925054,0.8300903818824075,2.7911110297625346,0.3886100780477334,0.4285193256028933,0.0697971173396144,4.621621621621622,4.0,2.3798696623398428,19.923076923076923,19.0,5.283669157253661,1.4555984555984556,1.0,0.7305770243917088,259,121,0.4671814671814672,1226,13,5.10.4,Specific vacation period,Chapter 5 - Earnings,"EIR 36(8)(a) describes the manner of allocating vacation pay when it is paid or payable for a specific vacation period. To apply this paragraph of the regulation, the vacation pay must be paid or payable for a specific period of vacation leave that is agreed to, either verbally or in writing, between the employer and the employee. Non-working days cannot be considered a specific vacation period unless there was an agreement between the employer and the employee that they were to be considered as a period of vacation leave (CUB 45288).\r\n    If the claimant's place of employment shuts down every year for a general vacation period, this period is deemed to be the claimant's vacation period, unless there are indications to the contrary. Moneys that have been held in trust and are paid to a claimant at the time of general vacation periods (for example in the Quebec construction industry) are not earnings at that time, due to the trust nature of the moneys (Digest 5.10.6).\nWhile still employed, employees are often paid regular wages or salary when taking vacation leave. It is paid on the regular payday or just before going on vacation. This situation falls clearly within this paragraph of the regulation; the regular wage or salary is vacation pay paid or payable for a specific vacation period, and is allocated to the period of leave.\nOnce the vacation period has been determined, the amount to be applied to that period will be made on the basis of normal weekly earnings, to consecutive weeks commencing with the first week of the claimant's vacation period, and ending with the last week of the vacation period (EIR 36(8)(a)). Earnings from another employment during the vacation period will be allocated to the same weeks as the vacation pay, meaning the total earnings for each week may exceed the rate of normal weekly earnings (EIR 36(8)(a)(ii); Digest 5.6.3.1).\r\n    Sometimes vacation pay is calculated as a percentage of total earnings each pay, but is not paid with each pay cheque. Rather, it is paid in a lump sum at different times throughout the employment. Depending on the event that was the real reason for the payment, the entire amount may or may not be allocated. If the vacation period was the real reason for the payment, then the balance left after allocating to the period of vacation (based on normal weekly earnings), is ignored. This is because in these situations, the vacation pay is only paid or payable for the period of leave. If the payment is caused by other events such as the claimant's request for payment of the vacation pay, an anniversary date, or a lay-off or separation, then any portion of the payment that is not for a specific vacation period is considered to be paid for the specific reason (i.e. event). As such, it will be allocated under the applicable subsection (EIR 36(8)(b); EIR 36(9); EIR 36(10); CUB 21545; Digest 5.10.3; Digest 5.10.5). Should the claimant actually take a vacation, a disentitlement for failing to prove availability may also be applicable (Digest 10.11.2).",0.99739033
257,257,257,"Vacation pay can be given for different reasons like when you take time off work, when you are laid off or leave a job, or on specific dates like work anniversaries. This pay is meant to compensate you for time you could have taken off for vacation.

To make sure the vacation pay is for the right time off, there are three things that must be true:

1. You and your boss agreed on when you would take your vacation. This agreement can be written or just spoken. If you cancel your vacation, it doesnâ€™t count. If the vacation is planned for the future, you need to agree on it before getting the vacation pay.

2. The vacation pay must be connected to the time you are supposed to have off. Sometimes, the pay and the vacation time are seen as two separate things. You donâ€™t have to be paid at the same time you take your vacation.

3. You must be working during the time you are supposed to be on vacation. If you are unemployed, you canâ€™t really take a vacation.

If you got your vacation pay before your vacation time, then the pay is for the vacation time if the time off was agreed upon, scheduled, and taken without pay. If you got your vacation pay after your vacation time, the pay is for the time you were supposed to take off.

If you got your vacation pay on a work anniversary when you are still working, the pay would be for a future vacation. And if you got your vacation pay on a work anniversary during a layoff, whether it's temporary or not, it will depend on whether you are expected back at work when your vacation time arrives.

If your layoff is indefinite, the pay is taken from the anniversary date because you can't be on vacation if you are not employed. If later you can prove you came back to work and took your leave, the pay can be changed to the vacation time.

If the Commission finds out that you were paid for a vacation you didn't take, they may change the pay. Your employer can help sort out if you can move your vacation to another time or if you have to cancel it because of a layoff or leaving the job.",78.67726745635912,7.266407730673318,10.899274998029323,11.710773067331672,7.540710723192021,6.375660847880297,35.51134663341646,3.1,0.8472207470944053,0.8560874594582452,2.6952522602228046,0.4915205535439734,0.4144922397980656,0.0385472397674633,4.022443890274314,3.0,2.126192201864792,20.05,20.5,7.592595076783695,1.2743142144638404,1.0,0.6273592606454851,401,127,0.3167082294264339,1661,20,5.10.4.1,Specific vacation period payment coinciding with other circumstances,Chapter 5 - Earnings,"Sometimes the payment of vacation pay may coincide with a lay-off or separation, or an anniversary date payment when, in fact, the real reason for the payment is to compensate for a specific vacation period. These specific vacation periods may be past, present, or future (CUB 73991; CUB 31967).\nTo allocate the vacation pay to these past, present or future vacation periods, the following 3 requirements must be met:\n\nthe vacation period must be scheduled by agreement between the employer and the employee (CUB 66035). This can be a written or verbal agreement. A cancelled vacation period no longer fulfills this requirement (CUB 24228). If it is a future vacation period, that future vacation period must have been scheduled before the payment of the vacation pay (CUB 67739)\nthere must be a connection between the payment of the vacation pay and the entitlement to a vacation period, that is, claimants are entitled to a vacation period for which they are entitled to pay (CUB 73991). Sometimes, contracts list vacation pay and vacation period as 2 different entities, not connected in any way. It is not required that the claimant be paid at the same time leave is taken, and\nthe claimant must be employed during the scheduled vacation period (EIA 2(1); Digest 5.3.1). It has long been held that the unemployed cannot be expected to go on vacation (CUB 68591)\n\nIn order to decide whether the vacation pay may be allocated to a specific vacation period rather than by reason of a lay-off or separation, or an anniversary date, it must first be determined whether the vacation pay was paid before or after the vacation leave period.\nWhen the vacation pay is paid after the leave period, allocation of vacation pay is to the leave period if the past leave period was unpaid, scheduled and taken. Taken means that the employer recognized that the claimant was on vacation leave without pay and was still considered an employee.\nWhen the vacation pay is paid before the leave period, the allocation of vacation pay to a future leave period depends on whether or not the claimant is unemployed at the time of payment, and if unemployed, whether the lay-off is temporary or indefinite. However, in all of these situations, the vacation period must also meet the 3 requirements noted above, in order to have the vacation pay allocated to the unpaid future vacation period. That is, the vacation period must have been scheduled prior to the payment, there must be a connection between the payment and the entitlement to the vacation period, and the claimant must be employed at the time that the vacation was taken.\nIf the vacation pay is paid on an anniversary date before the leave period, while the claimant is still employed, the vacation pay is allocated to the future leave period. This may later be reconsidered and the allocation reversed.\nIf the vacation pay is paid on an anniversary date that either coincides with a lay-off or occurs during a lay-off, allocation depends on whether the lay-off is temporary or indefinite. If the lay-off is temporary, and the claimant is expected to be back at work by the time the leave period arrives, the vacation pay is allocated to the future leave period. This may later be reconsidered and the allocation reversed.\nIf the lay-off is indefinite, the vacation pay is allocated from the anniversary date, as a claimant cannot be on vacation leave if they are not employed. This allocation can be reversed if, later, the claimant can show that they did in fact return to work and take the scheduled leave.\nSituations where the vacation pay was allocated to a future leave period may later be reconsidered, should the Commission become aware that leave was not taken. Generally, agreements between the employer and the employee will show whether or not the leave was considered to have been taken. The agreement may indicate that the employee is allowed to have their leave moved ahead to another future period, or cancelled for an indefinite period or because of a permanent separation. If the leave was moved ahead to another future period, the principles outlined in Vacation pay paid before the leave period apply. If the leave was cancelled for an indefinite period or due to a permanent separation, the vacation pay should be allocated based on the reason for the payment (such as the anniversary date or date of lay-off or termination) (CUB 24228).",0.99501616
258,258,258,"EIR 36(8)(b) is a rule that deals with situations involving vacation pay. The payment can be for different reasons, such as reaching an anniversary date, requesting the payment, or receiving it with each paycheck. However, it's important to understand the actual reason for the payment to determine if other parts of the rule apply. For example, vacation pay might seem like it was given because the employee asked for it or it happened to be an anniversary, but it could actually be meant for a specific vacation time or due to being laid off or leaving the job.

According to EIR 36(8)(b), earnings should only be counted when they are actually received. This means that vacation pay needs to be paid out before it's considered as part of the earnings. Once the vacation pay is received, it should be assigned to the period it's meant for. This begins with the week that the vacation pay is for, and it should be based on how much the employee typically earns in a week (EIR 36(8)). Different from other parts of the rule, if the employee earns other money from the same job during the assigned weeks, that money is also counted as part of those weeks (EIR 36(8)(b)(ii)).

Therefore, the wages or salary and the corresponding vacation pay are usually paid at regular intervals: in most cases, weekly, biweekly, semi-monthly or monthly. The fact that these earnings are not paid as soon as the work is performed does not change the fact that they became payable as soon as they are earned. Consequently, vacation pay paid as a percentage at the same time as wages or salary is allocated to the weeks it is earned. Vacation pay treated in this manner forms part of the normal weekly earnings of the claimant (Digest 5.6.3). The vacation pay is proportionate to the wages or salary earned in each week.

262,262,262,"When you're paid vacation money that's treated like savings, it doesn't count as income and isn't divided up. This happens when your employer, union, or agency takes your vacation money and puts it in a special account. This vacation money is seen as part of your pay when it's added to each paycheck.

For your vacation money to be seen as savings, a few conditions need to be met: the money must be kept in a separate account from the employer's regular money, your employer has to set aside the vacation money every pay period after deducting taxes and other fees, and you should be legally entitled to the money once it's set aside.

Just having a bank account set up by your employer isn't enough. They need to show that the money is clearly kept separate and cannot be used for anything else. It should be like a trust fund, where the money is only for paying out your vacation savings. If your employer can dip into that account, then it's not like a trust fund.

In order for the vacation pay to be officially seen as savings, there needs to be a clear record showing how the money moves from the employer to the fund and then to you. If it's all mixed together with other money, it's hard to tell what's really your vacation pay.

In some places, the law says vacation pay is automatically seen as a trust fund. But just having that law isn't enough to make sure your vacation money is safe. You should also have the right to ask for your money whenever you need it, not just when your job says so.

If your separate account earns interest, and that interest goes to you, it's one way to show that the money is being kept safe for your vacation pay.",76.5687261146497,8.151410373066422,10.914260884657429,12.283530482256596,9.194285714285712,7.111847133757959,37.71519563239308,3.4285714285714284,0.844022966348208,0.8624535302321116,2.638289659806784,0.4025888249680949,0.4442996772420917,0.052280671671657,4.121019108280255,4.0,1.991543646314656,22.428571428571427,18.0,12.257442553778649,1.2707006369426752,1.0,0.6129973500318668,314,128,0.4076433121019108,1356,14,5.10.6,Trust funds,Chapter 5 - Earnings,"Vacation pay that has the character of savings at the time the payment is made to the claimant is no longer considered income and is not allocated. This occurs when an employer, union or agency acts as a trustee, and the vacation pay is accumulated in a trust fund. The vacation pay is considered earnings at the time it is credited to each pay period.\nAll of the following requirements must be met in order for the vacation pay to be considered as savings when it is paid to the claimant:\n\nthe moneys must be set aside and kept separate from the employer's control and operations, that is, in a trust fund (FCA A-619-05; CUB 64729)\nthe employer must also set aside the vacation pay each pay period after deducting income tax, CPP, QPP and EI premiums, where applicable\nemployees must be beneficially entitled to the vacation pay after it is set aside (CUB 29010)\n\nA mere book entry in the employer's books is insufficient. The vacation pay must not only be kept separate, but the employer must show what steps have been taken to put these funds beyond the needs and control of the operation. This means that there must be separate accounts that cannot be accessed by the employer for running his business. A simple bank account would not suffice without taking measures similar to a trust (like some type of signed deed), to ensure that the moneys can only be used to pay out the vacation savings of the employees. The signed deed usually shows that one person undertakes to keep another's money for certain specific purposes. \nThe simple existence of a trust fund is not sufficient to qualify the vacation pay as savings. The trustee cannot benefit from the moneys deposited into the fund; only the employees can benefit. It cannot be considered as a trust account if the employer can borrow, interest-free, from the employees' supposedly separate account.\nFor an arrangement to be considered a true trust as those terms are ordinarily used, the money held in the trust must be identifiable or traceable. These terms mean that there should be a paper trail (i.e. documents) to show the flow of specific amounts of money from the employer, to the fund, to the employee. Also, it should not be held in a general fund that holds types of moneys other than vacation pay, because it is not possible to identify what is and is not vacation pay.\nSome provincial labour standard legislations specify that vacation pay simply accruing to an employee is deemed to be held in trust by the employer. The existence of such a law is not enough to deem that the vacation pay is held in trust for the employees (FCA A-47-90, CUB 15257A).\nEmployees must have the right to demand payment of the moneys, and are not confined by payout dates as specified in a collective agreement (FCA A-619-05; CUB 64729). People are beneficially entitled to property when they have the right to sue for and recover it (FCA A-352-90, CUB 17974).

If someone has been working there a long time, they might get more paid sick leave than someone who just started. But if a person has already used up all their sick leave, they might not get any more.

Paid sick leave is considered as part of a person's earnings. This means that even if someone doesn't take their paid sick leave, it still counts as part of their total earnings.

268,268,268,"Workers who get sick or hurt at work might get money from a state workers' compensation board. Companies pay into these boards to help compensate workers. The money can cover things like lost wages, medical bills, training, or equipment.

Payments from workers' compensation that aren't lump sums or final pensions are considered earnings. These payments replace lost wages. However, some payments are for other costs related to the illness or injury and aren't counted as earnings for benefit purposes.

For example, expenses like medical treatment, caregiver costs, or prescription medications aren't considered earnings. Costs for things like education or medical devices during recovery are also not earnings. But, if the payments are to support income during training, they are earnings.

Workers can also get money for permanent damage from an illness or injury. This money isn't considered earnings because it's a one-time payment, not meant to replace lost wages.

There are temporary income support payments that workers get until they recover fully or it's determined they won't fully recover. Permanent settlements are made when there's a long-term impact on the worker's ability to earn.

Workers' compensation payments are analyzed based on the terms and conditions of the payment.

Payments made by these boards are funded through contributions made by employers, and are paid under the provisions of provincial legislation. They may be for loss of income, prescriptions, medical treatment, rehabilitation costs (including training and medical equipment) clothing, attendant care allowances, or physical impairment.\nWCB payments received or to be received by a claimant, other than lump sums or pensions paid in full and final settlement of a WCB claim, are earnings for benefit purposes (EIR 35(2)(b)). Lump sums or pensions paid in full and final settlement of a WCB claim are specifically excluded from earnings (EIR 35(7)(a)).\nAlthough only full and final settlement WCB payments are specifically excluded from earnings for benefit purposes, not all other payments made by workers' compensation boards are earnings. Earnings for benefit purposes are only those moneys that replace earnings normally earned by labour, or that resemble moneys earned by labour (FCA A-241-94, CUB 24266). Moneys paid by WCB, designed to compensate a claimant for loss of income due to incapacity and that are not made in full and final settlement, clearly fall into this category.\nThere are other moneys paid by workers' compensation that are not intended to replace the claimant's lost income such as compensation for costs related to the illness or the injury itself. These moneys are not considered earnings for EI benefit purposes. These payments may include:\nreimbursement of medical, chiropractic or physiotherapy costs\ncosts in obtaining attendant care to assist with daily living, or\ncosts for prescriptions\nIn addition, costs associated with the rehabilitation process that are not designed to replace income, are not earnings. These costs could include tuition costs or prosthetic equipment. However, any payments designed to provide income support during rehabilitation training, are earnings.\nMoneys may be awarded under the workers' compensation legislation for permanent impairment associated with an illness or injury. These moneys may be paid to workers in full and final settlement for disfigurement or permanent diminished capacity. They may also be paid for the loss of enjoyment of life, directly related to the illness or injury. These moneys are not earnings as they are paid in full and final settlement, and are in no way related to compensation for the workers' loss of income. They can be likened to moneys paid to accident victims by insurance companies for permanently disfiguring injuries, or settlements paid to workers as damages to health or reputation, as a result of a wrongful dismissal (Digest 5.12.11).\nAlthough there may be different names given to income support provided by WCB, their commitment to pay is either temporary or permanent and made in full and final settlement of the person's claim.\nTemporary income support is paid to workers during the initial stages of their illness or injury. These temporary payments continue until the worker recovers, or until an assessment process determines that full recovery is not likely. Depending on the particular workers' compensation legislation and policies, this assessment process may occur at a set point in time (after 1 or 2 years have elapsed from the date of the accident), after all retraining or rehabilitation has occurred, or only after a plateau in the recovery process has been reached. Temporary income support payments are earnings because they are not made in full and final settlement of the workers' compensation claim.\nA full and final settlement is only made after the worker's health has been assessed and the extent of the worker's recovery is known. Full and final settlements are made when complete recovery is not expected (CUB 31595) or to settle a particular claim.\nFull and final settlements may be made to compensate for a work-related injury or illness that has caused permanent damage to the worker's ability to follow their pre-injury or pre-illness occupation, or any other suitable occupation. A full and final settlement may be made when WCB determines that the disability prevents the individual from working at any suitable employment, or when it is determined that the worker can work at some occupation, but not up to the worker's previous earning capacity (CUB 20091). The decision to pay an income support pension until age 65 represents WCB's commitment to discharge their obligations to pay income support on a claim for an injury or accident. The same would be true if a lump-sum amount was paid instead of a pension.\nFull and final settlements may also occur when the board decides to settle all their outstanding financial obligations to a worker by making a lump-sum payment and requiring that the worker sign away all rights to future payments (CUB 61311). However, for payments not made in lieu of a disability pension, there must be documentary evidence that the settlement releases the board from any further obligation to pay for that illness or injury. This applies whether or not the actual illness or injury is permanent.\nLike all earnings issues, it is the terms and conditions of the payment from the provincial WCB that determines whether it is made in full and final settlement of the claim. This remains true whether the board is fully and finally settling the claim by paying income support through a pension, or making an agreement with a worker to close their claim by paying a lump-sum amount.\nWhen the specific workers' compensation legislation uses terminology relating to permanency or pensions, it is easier to determine whether the payments are made in full and final settlement. WCB may pay income support for an injury from which a claimant is not expected to recover, under a section separate from the one under which temporary income support is paid. Other WCB legislation may pay temporary and permanent income support under the same legislative provision. In these cases, the WCB policies and administrative procedures must also be examined to determine whether the particular income support payment, which the claimant is receiving, is made in full and final settlement, or is just temporary until the claimant recovers or until an assessment on the probability of recovery can be made.\nWith workplace technological advances rapidly occurring, workers with disabilities that were thought to permanently prevent them from working, are finding and keeping employment that pays wages comparable to their pre-accident salary levels. In addition, medical science is evolving to such an extent that injuries and illnesses thought to disable an individual for the rest of their employable life may no longer do so. As a result, WCB may structure their commitment to pay income support to include a review process, and include provisions to have payments cease if the worker attains pre-accident earning capacity (CUB 38094). Although the commitment by the board is to pay a wage supplement or income support until age 65 in full and final settlement of their obligations, these supplements may be discontinued should it be discovered that the individual is again able to earn their previous level of pay. In effect, by this review process, it is not the permanency of the disability settlement that is being reviewed, but rather the level of the income support that the board is paying. The fact that there is a review process of the level of income support to be paid does not alter the nature of the settlement. The commitment to pay the income support is continuous and permanent; however, the level of income support may vary, or even cease, depending on the claimant's physical and employment circumstances.\nThe fact that the board makes a full and final settlement at some point in time cannot alter the nature of any temporary income support payments made until the WCB legislation or procedures allow a decision to be made regarding full and final settlement.\nWCB payments that are earnings are allocated to the period in respect of which they are paid or payable (EIR 36(12)(d)). These earnings do not prevent an interruption of earnings from occurring and are not considered earnings in the waiting period (EIR 35(4); EIR 39(3)(a)).",0.98339766
269,269,269,"Individuals involved in car accidents can get money from two places. One is through insurance that is part of a provincial law. The other is through insurance from a private company that is not part of a law in a province.

Money received for pain, suffering, disfigurement, or medical expenses from a car accident is not counted as income for employment insurance. But if money is meant to replace lost income from not being able to work, it might count as income for employment insurance, depending on where the money comes from and if employment insurance is factored into the calculations.

If someone gets money for not being able to work from a private insurance company, it doesnâ€™t count as income for benefit purposes. But if they get similar money from a provincial car insurance plan, it might count as income for benefits.

Government car insurance plans might cover losses from not being able to work. If the payments take employment insurance into account when deciding the money given, then the money is not counted as earnings for benefits.

Money received from provincial car insurance plans that donâ€™t consider employment insurance in deciding the amount paid is separated by weeks when figuring out benefits. It doesnâ€™t have to be actually paid out; it just needs to be possible to get it if claimed.

Payments from car accidents are not considered earnings if the person has worked enough hours to qualify for benefits after the accident. If benefits are paid for weeks after this condition is met, they are not counted as earnings for employment insurance.

Itâ€™s important to know the rules of the provinceâ€™s laws to understand the purpose of payments. Some plans might pay differently based on whether the person was working at the time of the accident. Money received as compensation for being unable to do tasks the person could do before the accident might not count as income if the person was not employed at the time of the accident.

Governmental insurance plans might consider employment insurance payments when calculating payments after an accident. But if a settlement offered to an accident victim doesnâ€™t consider employment insurance and is paid according to the law, then it might count as income for employment insurance benefits.

Some plans might keep paying the person even after they recover but havenâ€™t returned to work due to the accident. These payments are to make up for the lost job, and if they donâ€™t consider employment insurance, they count as income for employment insurance benefits.",58.865404109589065,10.489356164383562,14.117786864225405,15.51799086757991,11.98390410958904,10.892511415525114,48.61232876712329,5.85,0.856876370153929,0.8396988544199202,2.6598902222691887,0.5404955023690636,0.5090689299139254,0.0531409302401835,4.769406392694064,4.0,2.626572173535344,21.9,21.0,7.29314746868593,1.4863013698630136,1.0,0.8015649764425281,438,150,0.3424657534246575,2122,20,5.11.4,Motor vehicle accident insurance payments,Chapter 5 - Earnings,"Individuals who are involved in motor vehicle accidents may receive payments from one of 2 sources, depending on the coverage in effect when the accident occurred. Coverage may be either through insurance provided under or pursuant to a provincial law, or through insurance provided by commercial insurance companies not under or pursuant to a provincial law.\nPayments for pain, suffering, disfigurement, or medical expenses are never considered earnings for EI purposes, as they are not meant to compensate the person for the loss of employment income. However, payments meant to compensate a person for an actual or presumed loss of employment may be earnings for EI purposes, depending on the source of those payments and whether benefits under the EI Act are taken into account when calculating those payments.\nWhen payments for an actual or presumed loss of employment are made to a person from a commercial insurance carrier or company, that are not provided under or pursuant to a provincial law, these moneys are not earnings for benefit purposes. However, the same may not be true of similar payments made by motor vehicle insurance plans under or pursuant to provincial laws.\nGovernmental motor vehicle insurance plans may exist, which insure all drivers in a province and cover, among other things, the actual or presumed loss of employment. Payments from these plans are considered to be earnings, but only if benefits under the EI Act are not taken into account in determining the amount payable to the claimant (EIR 35(2)(d)). If EI benefits are taken into account, the moneys paid are not earnings for benefit purposes. \nGovernmental motor vehicle insurance plans take into account benefits under the EI Act when the plan deducts any EI benefits received, from the amount they pay the injured party.\nPayments from provincial motor vehicle insurance plans that do not take EI into account in determining the amount payable under the plan, are allocated to the weeks for which these amounts are payable (EIR 36(12)(c)), regardless of when they are actually paid. Furthermore, it is not necessary that such compensation be actually paid. It is sufficient that it could have been paid, had the claimant applied for it (EIR 35(2)(f)). The amount of the compensation that could have been paid, as well as the period it would have covered, will be determined according to what would appear most probable under the circumstances.\nMotor vehicle accident compensation payments are not considered earnings if, after the date of the accident, the claimant has accumulated enough hours of insurable employment that would allow them to establish a benefit period. Once this condition has been met, any motor vehicle accident payments covering subsequent weeks are not earnings and therefore not deducted from EI benefits (EIR 35(3)). It is not necessary that a new benefit period be established. For example, a claimant may have established an earlier claim, then returned to work and accumulated enough hours that would allow them to establish a new claim, but chose to renew the previous claim.\nIt is important to understand the terms of the applicable provincial legislation in order to determine the character and purpose of the benefits paid. Some provincial vehicle insurance plans may make a distinction regarding the benefits they provide to accident victims, depending on their employment status at the time of the accident. One type of benefits may be paid to individuals who were employed at the time of the accident and another to those who were unemployed.\nThe benefits paid to an individual who was considered employed at the time of the accident are paid to replace the actual or presumed loss of income from employment. These moneys are earnings for EI purposes if the amount of EI benefits is not taken into account in determining the amount that the claimant receives through the insurance. However, if the benefits paid to those unemployed at the time of the accident represent an indemnity for being unable to perform the essential tasks of living these benefits are not earnings. They reimburse the disabled claimant for expenses incurred to have others perform tasks that they were able to perform prior to the accident (for example: snow removal, lawn mowing, housework) and not in respect of the actual or presumed loss of income from employment (FCA A-94-94, CUB 23985).  \nProvincial governmental insurance plans may take into account EI payments in determining the amount to be paid for an actual or presumed loss of employment due to an accident.  However, a particular settlement offered to an accident victim may not. It is not just the specific provisions of the provincial insurance legislation regarding whether EI payments are normally deducted that must be considered. The circumstances of the payment to that particular individual and whether EI was deducted in determining the amount to be paid must also be examined. If it can be established that the settlement was payable for an actual or presumed loss of employment, was made pursuant to or under a provincial law, and EI was not taken into account in determining the amount payable, these moneys will be considered earnings for EI benefit purposes (EIR 35(2)(d)).\nSome provincial governmental accident insurance plans may continue payment after the individual has recovered but has not yet been able to return to employment that was lost due to the accident. These payments are designed to compensate the accident victim for the loss of the employment, and if EI is not taken into account in the calculation, then these payments are earnings for EI benefit purposes (EIR 35(2)(d)). These types of payments may also be made in provinces where EI is normally taken into account in determining the amount payable to the accident victim, in which case they would not be considered earnings for EI.",0.98633677

274,274,274,"Some employers offer a benefit called critical illness coverage to employees.

It is not meant to replace lost wages, but it's more like a type of life insurance benefit.

To determine if these payments count as earnings, it's important to look at specific details provided by the employer or the plan. Factors to consider include whether the employer offers any wage loss or sick leave plans, if the payments are a replacement for wage loss insurance, and if the amount of the payment is based on the employee's pay rate. The intention of these payments is usually to cover extra costs due to the illness, not to replace lost income from being unable to work.

These plans may provide a tax-free lump sum payment through an insurance provider, to employees on medical leave, in the event they (or a dependent) are diagnosed with a critical illness specifically covered by the plan. The payment may be used for any purpose, including subsidizing the cost of out of country treatment, paying down debts, or taking a vacation with the family while dealing with the disease.\nAlthough this is a group plan, generally, it is not meant to compensate for the loss of wages.  It is more in line with a type of life insurance benefit. Pursuant to EIR 35(2)(c) and Digest 5.11.2.1, group wage loss insurance plans are earnings for EI benefit purposes. However, this coverage differs in that the amount paid is not related to loss of wages. If a claimant or their dependant is ill with one of the illnesses or diseases covered by the plan, the claimant may be eligible for a lump sum payment.\nIn order to determine whether critical illness payments are earnings, full details of the payments must be obtained from the employer, and/or the plan. Factors to consider include:\nDoes the employer have any type of wage loss insurance plan or sick leave plan, to which the claimant is entitled?\nIf not, are critical illness payments meant to replace wage loss insurance payments?\nIf these payments are payable because the employee or dependent has been diagnosed with a critical illness, does the person have to be on leave without pay in order to have access to the payments from the insurance company?\nIf it is a dependent who has a critical illness, could the claimant continue working and access this payment?\nIs the lump sum payment the same amount in all cases; does it vary based on the employee's rate of pay, or is it equivalent to a specific period of time, based on the employee's pay rate?\nAs with any type of earnings, it must be determined whether the payment is considered earnings under EIR 35 and, if so, can it be excluded under EIR 35(3) or EIR 35(7)?\nIn many cases the determination process is straightforward, because the name or the nature of the payment clearly indicates that the moneys are income arising out of employment.  The allocation is then based on the applicable section of EIR 36. \nAs previously stated, the true nature of the payments must be established to determine whether they are advantages related to, attached to or arising out of employment. Relying solely on the terms used by the parties is sometimes insufficient because the name given to a payment does not necessarily determine its true nature. When doubt exists about the true nature of a payment, the best way to clarify the issue is to examine the intentions of the parties, by reviewing all relevant documents and contacting all the parties involved.\nIn most cases of critical illness payments, the intention of the payment is to cover additional expenses arising from the critical illness, and it is not meant as an income replacement in the event of incapacity. The policy may state that for benefits to be payable, the employee must satisfy a survival period, which is defined as a minimum number of consecutive days immediately following the date of diagnosis of a covered illness, or from the date of a surgery. The survival period and other conditions are normally specified in the plan. There may be different conditions based on the type of illness, or benefits may only be payable once to an employee. Further evidence that the payment is not linked to the employee's incapacity to work and loss of wages may be:\nnot all employees who become ill and unable to work are entitled to access this benefit\nit is a lump sum payment based on conditions related to the illness, as per the policy\nthe nature of the payment is a lump sum amount paid out regardless of the amount of time the person is off work\nit is not based on a percentage of the person's wages\nit is linked to the critical illness itself; specifically, to assist with the recovery of the illness\nIn most cases, based on the information provided, the payment would not be considered as earnings under EIR 35(2)(c)(i), as it is not a wage loss plan.

If you're paid because of leaving later, then the money is counted from that later date.
  
Lay-off:
A lay-off is when work stops temporarily due to not enough work or it's a scheduled break. During a lay-off, you might still have some job rights, like being able to come back or have priority based on how long you've worked there. A lay-off can be short or long, but the main thing is whether your employer still sees you as an employee with some rights during this time.

Separation:
Separation is when you completely stop working for a company. This could be because you were let go, the company was restructured or closed, or you chose to leave. You could separate on your last working day, during a lay-off if rights expire, or for some other reason like the company deciding to shut down later.

When this occurs and termination moneys are paid or payable, it is essential to determine which event triggered the right to the moneys; the lay-off, or the separation. When termination moneys are paid as a result of the later separation and not because of the earlier lay-off, the allocation of earnings commences from the date of the later separation (FCA A-392-07, CUB 68663).\n\nLay-off\nLay-off normally refers to a temporary stoppage of work, or to a period of inactivity or idleness, that is, a shortage of work, or a general vacation period.

The key is whether the employer considers the person an employee with certain rights or obligations during the period of lay-off.\nSeparation\nA separation refers to the final and complete severance of the employer-employee relationship. Usually it involves a dismissal, a restructuring, a closure or a voluntary separation. A separation may occur immediately on the last day of work.

277,277,277,"When someone loses their job, the money they receive could be considered part of their overall income from working. This includes things like severance pay, payment instead of notice, and unused vacation pay. These types of payments are meant to make up for the wages and benefits the person would have received if they were still working. They are seen as part of the working relationship between the employee and their employer.

Any money given by an employer or anyone else when a person leaves a job is usually related to that job. These type of payments are given to make up for lost wages and benefits unless there is proof showing otherwise. Money received because of losing a job or being laid off is typically seen as income that needs to be reported.

However, if the person getting paid can prove that the money is not related to the job they had or meant to make up for lost wages, then it's not considered income. For example, if a payment is for a work-related expense or to cover something not connected to the job, it may not be counted as income. Also, if a person receives money that's a return on their investment in a business, even if they were employed by that business, it's not seen as income from employment.

Sometimes, just looking at what the payments are called isn't enough to determine if they count as income. If there is uncertainty about whether the money received after leaving a job should be considered income, all the related documents should be looked at and everyone involved should be contacted.

For instance, a payment made after the termination of employment that is intended to reimburse a job-related expense, or money paid to compensate for losses unrelated to advantages arising from employment are not income (Digest 5.12.2.1; Digest 5.12.11; Digest 5.12.13).\nA payout of equity in a business (that is, a return of the amount a claimant invested in a business) is not related to employment, even if the claimant was employed by that business (FCA A-572-95, CUB 28759; Digest 5.16.0). If a payment does not arise out of employment, it is not earnings (Digest 5.3.1.6).\nRelying solely on the terms used by the parties involved to describe payments is sometimes insufficient. When doubt exists about the true nature of separation payments, the intentions of the parties must be examined by reviewing all relevant documents and contacting all parties involved (CUB 53378).

278,278,278,"Proper notice or pay instead of notice is required by law in all provinces when someone's job ends. This payment is different from other types of payments. When a job ends, the employer might give additional money for things like moving expenses. These extra payments may be called expenses, costs, or allowances. An allowance is a set amount of money given to cover anticipated expenses related to work or to help soften the blow of losing a job.

Money given for job-related expenses, like moving costs or retraining expenses, is not considered income if it doesn't result in a gain or benefit. However, money given as a living allowance while taking a course is seen as earnings and may affect benefits. 

If an employer pays money specifically to cover an expense, then the employee should show proof of that expense, like a receipt. If an employee is given more money than the actual expense or cost, it might still be okay as long as the employer had a good reason for the amount given. If an employee doesn't end up using the money as intended, it might be considered income. 

If an employee has to spend money for job-related reasons but hasn't done so yet, they must prove they intend to spend the money for that purpose. If the amount given by the employer seems too much or if there are doubts about the payment, receipts might be needed to show how the money was spent.

When employment ceases, an employer may make payments in addition to pay in lieu of notice or severance pay. These additional payments may be referred to as expenses, costs, or allowances (for example, moving expenses, moving costs, or moving allowances). Although claimants and employers may use the terms interchangeably, an allowance differs slightly from a straight reimbursement of an actual expense or cost. An allowance is a set amount that is designed to reimburse an anticipated expense or cost associated with employment, or a set amount intended to mitigate the loss of employment (Digest 5.3.2; Digest 5.3.3.1; Digest 5.3.3.2). The same general principles apply whether the expenses are paid during employment or on termination.\nThe payment of job-related allowances and the reimbursement of job-related expenses and costs, are excluded as income when the moneys do not represent a gain or a benefit. On termination of employment, the definition of job-related expenses is expanded to include payments related to the loss of employment. Relocation costs associated with a move to another community, tuition and text-book costs associated with retraining, or other moneys specifically paid to reimburse actual expenses related to job loss and re-employment, are intended to mitigate the employment loss, and are not income.\nMoneys provided as a living allowance while attending a course, cannot be treated in the same way as those provided to cover the direct, specific and actual costs or expenses associated with the termination, such as tuition fees or books, which are associated with the taking of a course. A living allowance is more like a wage or income replacement or income support allowance, and is intended to permit the individual to survive while attending the course. As such, a living allowance paid by an employer is considered earnings paid by reason of a lay-off or separation. However, a living allowance is not deducted from benefits if the claimant is attending a course, to which they have been referred by the Commission, or a designated authority (EIA 19(4); EIR 16(1)).\nA claimant cannot claim an expense for which the employer did not expressly intend to reimburse. For instance, a decision to move to another location or to go to school, does not entitle the claimant to claim the expense of the move or the cost of the tuition and books, if the employer did not expressly intend to reimburse the claimant for these costs. The exception to this rule would be any expenses directly incurred to obtain termination moneys, such as legal fees, court costs and other legitimate expenses directly related to the legal action (Digest 5.12.11.4).\nThe best way for the claimant to prove that moneys are intended to compensate for an expense is to show that the employer either pays a third party directly for the expense, such as paying a moving company or university, or only reimburses the claimant the actual amount of the cost or expense when bona fide receipts are presented. The employer's statement to this effect is generally sufficient and the Commission does not require receipts from the claimant.\nWhen the employer gives the employee a lump sum that is specifically intended to reimburse an expense or cost, the claimant must demonstrate that the cost or expense was actually incurred, by providing receipts. An exception to providing receipts would be for a relocation. Receipts are not required when the move, which the employer intended to compensate, actually occurred and the allowance paid by the employer is reasonable under the circumstances. Even when the expense or cost is less than the amount paid by the employer, the payment is not considered income. For example, the employer may calculate a moving allowance based on hiring a moving company, but the employee may rent a truck to move, and be able to keep the difference. As long as the employer based the payment on a reasonable estimate of the expense or cost, the difference is not considered a gain or a benefit. However, in the situation where the claimant moves to a closer location than that which the employer intended to reimburse, only the actual cost of the move can be considered; the balance is considered income. If the claimant does not move at all, then any payment made by the employer is considered a benefit to the claimant because there was no expenditure. The entire amount would therefore be considered earnings paid or payable by reason of the lay-off or separation and allocated (EIR 36(9); EIR 36(10)).\nThere may be situations where payments are made for job search and job training expenses, or costs that have not yet been incurred by the claimant. This may be because the claimant did not have the funds required to incur these expenses prior to receiving the moneys from the employer. In these situations, the claimant must demonstrate that there is a genuine intent to spend the moneys for the purpose for which they were paid, in order that these moneys not be considered earnings paid or payable by reason of the lay-off or separation (FCA A-567-99, CUB 42598A).\nIf the amount paid by the employer appears excessive in relation to the intended expense, or there is reason to doubt the validity of the payment, receipts would be required as proof of the expenditure. Excessive means exceeding the usual, proper, or normal and implies an amount too great to be reasonable or acceptable. When receipts are required and the compensation exceeds the receipts, the balance is considered income, and allocated. Likewise, when the expenditure did not actually occur, the Commission may conclude from the evidence that the money was intended to compensate for the loss of wages and would allocate the entire amount as earnings (CUB 33178).\nWhen the amount of the expense or cost incurred exceeds the amount that was given in the agreement for a specific purpose, only that portion of a termination payment that was specifically intended to reimburse that expense or cost can be excluded as income. In other words, the costs that exceed the amount given by the employer for this specific purpose cannot be claimed to reduce other moneys that are earnings, such as severance pay or vacation pay.",0.97229475
279,279,279,"Employees who are leaving their job can choose to receive their final earnings (like severance pay) in different ways. They can have the money sent to a bank to buy a retirement savings plan (RRSP), or have it put directly into a retirement savings account. This choice does not change how it affects their Employment Insurance (EI) benefits. The important thing is why the money is being paid and that it is being paid or will be paid soon.

Whether the claimant accepts a cheque and deposits it into a savings account; accepts a direct deposit payment and purchases a RRSP; or has the employer purchase the RRSP, the result is the same for EI purposes (CUB 47731). The termination earnings are considered paid or payable by reason of the lay-off or separation and are allocated from the date of the event that gave right to the money (EIR 36(9); Digest 5.6.1). Purchasing a RRSP does not alter the nature of the earnings, nor the fact that the earnings were immediately due and therefore considered paid or payable. The critical factor is not where the employee ultimately directed the money, but rather the reason for the payment and the fact it was paid or payable. This does not include pension credits transferred from one locked-in vehicle to another. \nThe same is true when employees choose to have all or part of their severance or other termination pay deposited directly into their pension plan, in order to purchase additional pension credits and enhance their pension entitlement (CUB 42897). The choice to use one benefit (that is, the severance pay), to improve another (that is, the pension), does not alter the nature of the severance pay, nor the fact that it was paid or payable.",0.9983956
280,280,280,"When you get money because you were laid off or left a job, the process of dividing that money starts from the week when you were laid off or left the job, depending on what caused the payment. This means that the amount of money you receive in each following week (except the last week) will be the same as what you used to make in a normal week at that job. 

If you get money because you were laid off or left a job, it doesn't matter when or how you actually get the money. The important thing is that the money will be divided starting from the week of the layoff or separation, not when you actually get paid. 

If you had other jobs where you earned money, the amounts you received from each job will be divided separately. Also, any money you earned in the past that might affect the benefits you receive now will also be taken into account. There is no limit to how far back these earnings can be considered. 

If you get more money later related to the same layoff or separation, that additional money will be added to what you already received, and the total amount will be divided starting from the week of the layoff or separation. 

The timing or method of how you get paid, delays in payment by your employer, or even if you received separation money before you actually left your job, won't change how the money is divided. It will always start from the week of layoff or separation. 

If you agree, you can have all the money you will receive for separation pay divided right away from the week you were laid off or separated. This way, once the division is done, you can start receiving benefits without having to wait for each payment. But if you don't agree, the division will only happen each time you receive a payment. 

If there are delays in your payment due to administrative reasons like when your employer runs payroll, the money will still be divided starting from the week of separation, even if you haven't physically received the payment yet.",70.03706521739132,10.020667701863356,10.914260884657429,13.340372670807454,11.781552795031054,8.127826086956524,42.86180124223603,4.357142857142857,0.8604483558581426,0.902316744128863,3.1031401262141065,0.6651060356004352,0.43293704865467,0.0584195326136824,4.260869565217392,4.0,2.1039278236989487,26.285714285714285,25.0,9.261506907846131,1.3016304347826086,1.0,0.6827036679293285,368,137,0.3722826086956521,1613,14,5.12.4,Allocation of earnings paid or payable by reason of a lay-off or separation,Chapter 5 - Earnings,"Once moneys are determined to be earnings paid or payable by reason of a lay-off or separation, the allocation always starts from the week of the lay-off or separation, whichever event was the reason for the payment (CUB 45664; Digest 5.6.1). The allocation is such that the total earnings from that employment are, in each consecutive week except the last, equal to the claimant's normal weekly earnings from that employment (EIR 36(9)).\nIf the earnings are paid by reason of a lay-off or separation, that fact remains the same, regardless of the method or date of payment. These earnings are allocated from the week of the lay-off or separation, and not from the date of payment.\nEarnings paid or payable by reason of a lay-off or separation are allocated consecutively if there are other earnings from the same employment. However, they are allocated over the same period as any earnings from any other employment (Digest 5.6.3.1).\nTermination earnings from past employments that might affect a current entitlement to benefits are also allocated. This is necessary because neither the act nor the regulations prescribe a maximum period of time over which the earnings may be allocated (FCA A-159-13, CUB 80192A). These earnings are allocated concurrently with any earnings from other employment.\nIf an allocation of earnings by reason of a lay-off or separation has already been made, any subsequent earnings paid or payable by reason of that same lay-off or separation are added to the previously allocated earnings (EIR 36(10)). The revised combined total is then allocated from the date of the lay-off or separation (EIR 36(9)).\nThe claimant's choice of the method or time of payment, a delay by the employer in issuing payment, or a payment of separation moneys made prior to the termination of employment, do not affect the period for which the earnings are allocated. Any allocation of earnings begins from the date of the lay-off or separation. In other words, the method or timing of payment only affects when the Commission takes action to allocate the money, not the period for which it is allocated. For example, if an employee chooses to receive quarterly payments for 3 years, the earnings cannot be allocated until each payment is made, because the earnings are not payable until each quarterly period arrives. Regardless of the number of payments made, there was not a series of lay-offs or separations and therefore only one event that triggered the claimant's right to those moneys; the initial lay-off or separation (EIR 36(9); EIR 36(10)). Each subsequent payment is added to the termination money that has already been allocated, and the entire amount is allocated from the date of separation.\nIn this situation, if the claimant agrees, the entire amount that will ultimately be received in separation pay may be allocated immediately from the date of the lay-off or separation. By doing so, once the allocation has ended, the claimant will be entitled to benefits (assuming all other entitlement conditions are met) without the requirement to recalculate the allocation multiple times. However, if the claimant does not agree to this method of allocation, then an allocation can only be amended each time a payment is made.\nOn the other hand, if the payment is only delayed because of administrative reasons, such as the timing of the employer's payroll run, the earnings are still payable and would be allocated immediately, even if the actual payment has not yet been made (Digest 5.6.1).",0.99102
281,281,281,"By law, when a company needs to let employees go, they have to tell them in advance. When they can't do that, they can give the employees money instead of notice. This can happen if the company either completely ends the working relationship with the employee or if it's a temporary lay-off where they may or may not know how long it will last.

The amount of notice or money given is usually based on how long the employee has worked at the company. Each province has its own rules about the minimum notice or money that must be given. Sometimes, agreements between the company and employees, company rules, or the lay-off situation might require more notice or money to be given. 

Employers have a few options when laying off employees:
- they can give notice and ask the employee to keep working during that time
- they can let the employee go immediately and pay them instead of giving notice
- they can give notice and pay money at the same time

Sometimes, money instead of notice is paid even if it's not required, like when an employee is let go for a serious reason. In some provinces, if a temporary lay-off is expected to be short, the employee might not get money or notice when they stop working. However, if the lay-off goes on for a long time, the employer might have to pay money instead of notice eventually.

Decisions about when to pay money instead of notice depend on the specific situation and the rules that apply. If an employee is temporarily laid off first and then later let go for good, it will need to be figured out whether the money should be allocated from the time of the temporary lay-off or the final separation. 

Overall, how this money is distributed depends on the rules of the province, the situation, and the specific case.",65.60386178861789,10.89926829268293,11.855464076750408,14.347967479674796,12.483922764227644,8.39390243902439,46.540650406504064,5.25,0.8832903775301847,0.8709484517574311,3.0933459422913017,0.5248106308786582,0.4165158923185821,0.0619016059234286,4.298780487804878,4.0,2.2877720497930727,27.33333333333333,21.5,16.224124698183942,1.3414634146341464,1.0,0.6666170911568999,328,130,0.3963414634146341,1454,12,5.12.5,Wages in lieu of notice,Chapter 5 - Earnings,"By law, an employer must give employees adequate notice of a lay-off. Wages paid in lieu of notice (also known as pay in lieu of notice) are payments made when the employer has been unable to provide sufficient notification of a lay-off or separation. The termination of employment may involve a complete severance of the employer-employee relationship, or it may simply be a temporary lay-off, where the period of lay-off may or may not be known.\nUsually the calculation of the number of weeks of notice that must be given, or paid, is based on the number of years the employee has been employed by the company. Provincial legislation generally dictates the minimum notice that must be given. Collective agreements, company policy or the circumstances of the lay-off may prescribe a greater period. The employer can:\n\ngive the proper notice and expect the employee to work during the notice period\nrelease the employee immediately without notice and pay wages in lieu of notice, or\nprovide both a proper notice period and pay wages in lieu of notice\n\nOccasionally wages in lieu of notice may be paid when there is no requirement to do so, such as, when an employee is dismissed for cause.\nIn some provinces, if a lay-off is expected to last less than a specific period of time set by that province's legislation, wages or pay in lieu of notice do not need to be paid when the employee ceases to work. Even when the lay-off is for an indefinite period, which may exceed the time period set by legislation, the employer may delay payment until the time limit is reached. When the lay-off exceeds this legislated time period, the lay-off is no longer considered temporary, and wages in lieu of notice, if not already paid, become payable. In these cases, it will have to be determined which event triggered the payment; the initial lay off, or the complete severance of employment. Allocation of wages in lieu of notice will begin from the date of the event that triggered the payment.\nDecisions regarding the allocation of wages in lieu of notice must be made on a case-by-case basis, in accordance with the applicable labour standards legislation, and the specific facts of each case. Whether wages in lieu of notice become payable upon the temporary lay-off or upon complete severance of employment, depends on the relevant employment standards legislation that governs those payments.\nIn cases where the initial lay off is permanent, regardless of when wages in lieu of notice are actually paid, they would be allocated from the date of the initial lay-off.\nWhen a claimant on a temporary layoff is later separated from employment and receives wages in lieu of notice as a result of the complete separation, a determination must be made whether the moneys should be allocated from the week of the temporary lay-off or from the week of the complete separation from employment. In these cases, the trigger of the payment would need to be determined; is it the temporary layoff that occurred earlier, or the permanent separation from employment.\nIf the provincial or territorial labour standards deem that wages in lieu of notice are only payable upon complete severance of employment, the earnings will be allocated beginning on the date of the complete severance. In some provincial employment legislation, if the period of lay-off exceeds what is considered a temporary lay-off under that legislation, then the date of termination is deemed to be the date of the initial temporary lay-off. In those cases, the earnings will be allocated from the initial lay-off date.\nIf the employer issues wages in lieu of notice during a period of temporary lay-off, and the lay-off remains temporary (that is, no termination has occurred), the payment is allocated from the date of the initial lay-off.",0.9099567
282,282,282,"Severance pay is something you might get when you leave a job after working there for a long time. It's like a thank you for your years of service and to make up for suddenly not having a job anymore. How much you get can depend on how long you worked there and your job position. Some places have rules that say when and how much severance pay you should get. If a law says you have to get severance pay, then the amount is determined by a formula based on how long you worked for that employer. When labor laws apply, you might receive your severance pay right away when you leave your job, or it might be after a certain period of time that you haven't been called back to work.

It is almost always paid only when the employer-employee relationship completely terminates. Collective agreements or company policy may contain a clause requiring the payment of severance pay in certain circumstances. Factors such as length of service and the employee's position may dictate the amount of the payment. Severance pay paid in compliance with provincial legislative requirements is a legislated form of recognition for service, and the amount is based on a formula related to the years of employment with that employer.\nLabour legislation, when applicable, may require the payment of severance pay immediately upon separation or when, by provincial statute, a separation is determined to have occurred. In those provinces where such legislation exists, the last day of work, that is, date of lay-off, is the date used to calculate the beginning of the lay-off period. When the claimant has not been recalled to work after a designated number of weeks or months, the provincial legislation states that a separation occurs at that time, and requires the payment of severance pay (Digest 5.12.6.1). In this scenario, the lay-off and separation have occurred at different times. Severance pay is payable by reason of the separation, which occurred only after a certain period of time had passed, and not by reason of the initial lay-off. In this case, the severance pay would be allocated from the week of the separation from employment. Wages in lieu of notice may also be payable and would be allocated from the week in which the lay-off or separation occurred, depending on which event gave right to the money (EIR 36(9); Digest 5.12.5).\nSeverance pay is earnings paid or payable by reason of a lay-off or separation. It is therefore allocated at normal weekly earnings from the week in which the lay-off or separation occurred, depending on which event gave right to the money (Digest 5.12.4).\nWhere a Court issues a valid Order directing the division of severance pay as a matrimonial asset, only the portion of the severance pay that the claimant retains, is allocated (CUB 29337).",0.96337664
283,283,283,"The terms of a contract or company policy might say that if an employee is laid off, they can keep the right to be hired back until they give it up or until a certain amount of time passes. In some cases, getting severance pay is connected to giving up this right or when the time runs out. The question is whether the severance pay is given because of the layoff or once the job is completely over.

If the severance pay is tied to giving up the right to be hired back, then the pay isn't given until that happens and the person is officially no longer employed there. This means the pay is because the job ended, not just because of the layoff itself. The severance pay starts from the week when the job ends.

Sometimes an employee might decide not to get the severance pay right away if it means they have to give up the chance to be hired back. In these cases, the pay can be held by the labor department until the right to be hired back is gone. This way, the money will be there when the right is gone. If the pay only happens when the job completely ends, which may not be until the person gives up the right to be hired back, then the pay is not considered given until one of these things happens. When unsure, the laws in the province and what the company's policy says about hiring back should be checked.

To start getting the severance pay when the right to be hired back is given up or ends, there must have been a possibility of being rehired at that workplace. If rehiring was never an option, then the severance pay starts from the week of the layoff.

There are cases where the right to be hired back might still be there, even if it seems unlikely due to things like the business closing or the company going bankrupt. As long as there's a small chance of being rehired, the severance pay is given when that right ends, not from the layoff date. This chance of being rehired could be with the same company at a different location, with a new owner, or with a receiver. When the business completely closes or goes bankrupt, and there's no chance of being rehired, the job is considered over.

In cases where there's no actual chance of being rehired, the severance pay is not given until the end of the period when the right to be hired back lasts, unless the person agrees to get the money earlier. 

In some cases, the severance pay is not tied to the right to be rehired, and it's given even if the chance to be rehired still exists. When the pay is not connected to the right to be rehired, it's given because of the layoff, and it starts from that date.

Whether the severance pay is given right after the layoff, without affecting the right to be rehired, or only once the job is totally over and the right to be hired back is gone, the employee might be able to choose when and how to get paid. If the person picks getting the pay in multiple payments over time, then the amount given in each payment is added to the previous ones and starts from the date of the layoff or when the job ended, depending on what allows the pay to be given.",73.50607087827429,9.669090909090908,9.457814108942454,12.557781201848998,11.30605701078582,7.224203389830507,39.6995377503852,3.4545454545454546,0.8846930492491949,0.8866813212633133,3.0350573079705683,0.4853649306690438,0.4564236134911278,0.0598501100027741,4.103389830508474,4.0,1.992653124643328,26.818181818181817,24.5,9.966472721700326,1.2542372881355932,1.0,0.5365685177149468,590,170,0.288135593220339,2487,22,5.12.6.1,Recall rights,Chapter 5 - Earnings,"The terms of a collective agreement, contract or company policy may state that a laid-off employee retains recall rights until they are surrendered, or a specified period of time expires. The payment of severance pay may then be linked to the surrender and expiration of recall rights. The issue to be determined is whether it is the lay-off or a subsequent separation of employment that is the reason for the payment of the severance pay.\nWhen the payment of severance pay is dependent upon the surrender or expiry of recall rights, there is no entitlement to severance pay until one of those events occurs, resulting in a separation from employment (FCA A-392-07, CUB 68663). In this case, the severance pay is payable by reason of the termination of the employer-employee relationship (that is, the separation from employment), and not because of the cessation of work (that is, the lay-off). Allocation of the severance pay commences with the week in which the separation occurred.\nSometimes an employee does not wish to take immediate advantage of a legislative right to severance pay, if the right to the payment is conditional on relinquishing recall rights. If the option of maintaining the employer-employee relationship is available with the employer, the employee may be able to request that the severance pay be paid in trust directly to a provincial labour department. In some provinces, the severance pay must be paid in trust to the provincial labour department when an employee chooses to retain their recall rights. This ensures that the money is available to be paid at the time the recall rights expire. If the severance pay is only payable when a separation occurs, which might happen only when the recall rights are surrendered or expire, then the severance pay, even if paid in trust to a provincial labour department, is not considered paid nor payable to the claimant until one of the events occurs. Only when the severance pay is immediately due to the claimant can an allocation occur. When doubt exists, the provincial legislation and the employer's policy regarding recall rights must be examined.\nIn order to allocate severance pay beginning with the week that recall rights are surrendered or expire, first, there must have been a possibility of recall with that employer. If there was never a possibility of recall, allocation of the severance pay will start with the week that the lay-off occurred.\nThere may be cases in which recall rights are maintained, even though it may appear that they no longer exist due to a permanent reduction in the employer's workforce, closure at one of the employer's business locations, or receivership. As long as there is even a slight possibility of recall, severance pay would be payable at the time those rights are surrendered or they expire, and not from the date of the lay-off. The possibility of a recall can be with the same employer at the same location (if the employer continues to operate the business at a reduced level), at another of the employer's business locations, with a successor employer (CUB 41053A), or with a receiver. When a business ceases operations entirely and there is no arrangement with a successor employer to maintain recall rights, or an employer is bankrupt, recall rights do not exist. As such, the permanent separation is considered to occur when the employer ceases operations or the bankruptcy occurs, ending the employer-employee relations.  In cases where no actual recall rights exist, allocation should not take place until the severance pay is payable at the end of the recall period, unless the claimant agrees to allocation (Digest 5.12.4).\nIn other cases the severance pay is not linked to recall rights and is payable even though the employee still retains recall rights. When the payment of severance pay is not linked to the recall rights being surrendered or having expired, the severance pay is considered payable by reason of the lay-off, and would be allocated from that date.\nWhether the severance pay is payable immediately by reason of the lay-off, and recall rights are not affected, or whether it is payable only when the separation is final and recall rights have been surrendered or expired, the employee may have the right to choose the method or time of payment. If the employee chooses to have multiple payments made over a specific period, the allocation of severance pay must be recalculated each time a payment is made.  The amount of each additional payment is added to any previous amounts and is allocated from the date of the initial lay-off or separation, whichever event gave right to the payment.",0.9946791
284,284,284,"Retirement payments, also known as retirement benefits, are like a type of goodbye payment when someone leaves their job. These payments can be given instead of, along with, or on top of a regular goodbye payment. When we say ""retirement,"" it doesnâ€™t always mean the person is retiring for good; it might just be from a specific job. The money might be given all at once or in smaller amounts over time. Usually, retirement benefits come from the company's regular funds, but any money the company put into a pension fund is paid from there. 

The amount of retirement payment can depend on how long the person worked there or a special math formula based on how many months are left before the person can retire early or at a standard retirement age. The company might be paying this money because they promised to when the employee leaves, or they might be doing it to help the employee out, or even as an extra reward for retiring early outside of a contract agreement. Sometimes companies offer these payments to encourage employees to retire early. These offers can come in different ways. For instance, some employees might be allowed to take time off with full or less pay before officially retiring. Continuing to pay the employee even when they are not working keeps their income steady. However, if the person starts to receive money from another job, their employment insurance claim might change. Sometimes, even after leaving a job, the person might keep getting paid periodically like a salary or a reduced salary that's similar to what a pension would be. This type of payment is not exactly a pension but a different kind of benefit known as a bridging benefit.

If someone gets a payment representing the employer's contribution to the pension plan that wasn't locked into a pension fund, it's seen as another type of retirement benefit. These payments are considered earnings because they come from work. If these payments are made because of leaving a job, they are treated the same as other types of termination payments. When a person gets back the money they put into their own pension, it doesn't affect their employment insurance benefits because this money was already counted as their income during their time working.",63.608914141414175,9.700757575757574,11.855464076750408,12.91919191919192,11.432028860028865,10.490285714285717,47.36291486291486,5.555555555555555,0.8437347482232487,0.823394987732172,2.631390059972171,0.5578819520707489,0.464335311147116,0.0728061395127327,4.706493506493507,4.0,2.3936245223204784,21.38888888888889,20.0,8.957547338473162,1.4363636363636365,1.0,0.7111193099356817,385,172,0.4467532467532467,1864,18,5.12.7,Retirement payments,Chapter 5 - Earnings,"Retirement payments (also referred to as retirement benefits or allowances) are generally a form of severance pay. Retirement payments may be in lieu of severance pay (CUB 39180), in addition to severance pay, or an enhancement of severance pay. The term retirement does not necessarily mean the employee is retiring from the workforce, rather only from a specific employment. The payment may be paid periodically, or in a lump sum. Retirement benefits are usually paid from general company revenue funds, but any return of employer contributions is paid out of a pension fund. For the purposes of this section, retirement payments or benefits do not refer to pensions (Digest 5.13.5).\nThe amount of the retirement payment may be based on years of service, or a formula related to the number of months left before the employee reaches early or normal retirement age. The employer may be fulfilling a contractual obligation to a departing employee, offering a gratuitous payment in consideration of the employee's circumstances, or offering an early retirement incentive outside the usual terms of the employment contract.\nLump sum or periodic retirement payments are often offered as an incentive for early retirement. These incentives can be offered in many different forms. Some employees may be given a leave of absence with full or reduced pay prior to going on pension. The continuance of an employee's salary, even without the performance of services, would prevent an interruption of earnings. However, if an interruption of earnings from another employment has occurred, allowing the claimant to establish an EI claim, the salary continuance earnings are allocated on that claim, to the period for which they are payable (EIR 36 (5)). If the employee is receiving their usual pay for the period of leave, there may be an issue of not unemployed that must be addressed (Digest Chapter 4). In other cases, the claimant may cease to be an employee, yet still receive a periodic payment equivalent to the normal salary, or a reduced salary. The reduced salary may equal what the pension would be. This is a type of bridging benefit, but it is not a pension bridging benefit (Digest 5.13.5.2). If the claimant is no longer an employee, the payments are considered paid or payable by reason of the lay-off or separation and allocated like all other termination earnings (EIR 36(9); EIR 36(10)).\nA payment of all or a portion of the employer's pension contributions that were not locked in to the pension fund, is also considered a type of retirement benefit. Such payments are earnings, whether made under the terms of the pension plan, or as a gratuitous payment by the employer, as they arise out of employment (Digest 5.13.8.2). Since they were paid by reason of a lay-off or separation, they would be allocated in the same manner as any other termination payment (EIR 36(9); CUB 60041). A return of the employee's own pension contributions has no impact on EI benefits, as these moneys were part of the claimant's gross earnings during the period of employment (EIR 35(2); EIR 36(4); EIR 36(5); Digest 5.13.8.1).",0.9842292

288,288,288,"Determining if money received as compensation for getting fired is considered part of your job income is done the same way for any money you get after being let go from a job. When someone sues for being unfairly fired, they can claim various issues like being treated badly, not being given proper notice, or losing money and status.

Getting money for being fired unfairly can come from a court, a tribunal, or an agreement made outside of court. Unfair firing could mean being fired without a good reason or not getting enough notice. If you aren't at fault, you should get a fair warning before being let go, and if you don't, you should get paid for that time instead.

If you're fired for a good reason, you might not get any warning or pay for the time you would have been given to find a new job. However, if you think you were pushed to quit, you might seek payment for that situation too. The money you receive in these cases is viewed in the same way as money for being unfairly fired.

Sometimes, you might be offered money instead of notice that you're being let go. You can choose to accept it or not. If you decide to challenge your firing or the terms of the offer, you can take legal action or ask your union for help.

Whether the case goes to court or gets settled out of court, any money received as a result is generally called compensation for being unfairly fired. How that money is divided depends on if you're reinstated or not. The payments you get for lost wages if you're not reinstated are not considered compensation and are divided differently.

Actions lodged for wrongful dismissal may cover a variety of issues ranging from abusive dismissal, failure to give proper notice, libel and defamation, loss of income, loss of status, etc.\nDamages for wrongful dismissal include any moneys awarded by a court or a tribunal, or agreed upon in an out-of-court settlement, following a dismissal that the employee claims was wrongful. Wrongful can mean either that the employment was terminated without cause or that the amount of notice was insufficient. Without cause simply means the employee was not at fault, or that dismissal was too harsh under the circumstances.\nAn employment contract is not always indefinite; either the employer or the employee can terminate it at any time, sometimes without the other's consent. There is not necessarily any wrongdoing when an employment contract is terminated, unless the employment is protected by legislative or contractual provisions. Termination in these cases is wrong if there is no cause. An employee who is not at fault is entitled to reasonable notice of a lay-off or separation. If sufficient notice is not provided, the employee is entitled to remuneration for the notice period (that is, pay in lieu of notice).\nAn employee who is fired for cause is not entitled to notice or to pay in lieu of notice, although it may be offered. Likewise, pay in lieu of notice is usually not offered when an employee quits. However, if the employee claims that the circumstances forced a resignation, that employee may seek damages. Awards or settlements made in these circumstances are damages for constructive dismissal and are treated in the same manner as damages for wrongful dismissal.\nWhen pay in lieu of notice is offered, the employee may accept or reject the offer. If the offer is accepted, that is usually the end of the matter. The principle of received and accepted is covered in section 5.6.1 of this chapter. If the employee refuses the offer, no allocation is made until a settlement is reached and accepted by the claimant.\nWhether or not remuneration is offered, the employee may decide to challenge the dismissal itself, or the terms of the separation offer, if one was made. An employee who is dismissed is protected only to the extent provided for by federal statute, by the labour legislation of the province where the work is performed, or by a union contract. The employee may file a grievance through a union to try to be reinstated, or consult a lawyer and claim damages for wrongful dismissal through the courts.\nWhether the case proceeds to court and is settled by a judge, or it is settled out of court, any payment made as a result of that process is generally known as damages for wrongful dismissal. Whether the employee is reinstated or not is only important in determining how the payment will be allocated. The allocation will however, begin with the week of dismissal or termination of employment, regardless of how or when the actual payment is made. The amounts paid to an employee to compensate for lost wages where the employee is not reinstated, do not represent damages and are allocated pursuant to EIR 36(9) and EIR 36(10). Information concerning payments for lost wages  paid to an employee who is reinstated after being wrongfully dismissed is included in another section, as they are payments in exchange for the relinquishment of the right to be reinstated (Digest 5.12.12; Digest 5.12.13).",0.84934384
289,289,289,"An employee who believes they were fired unfairly can take legal action. They start by submitting a document called a statement of claim to the court.

Both parties sign a final release, agreeing to the terms and promising not to take further action.\nIf they can't reach a settlement, a judge or a labor arbitration group will decide the case. When deciding on compensation for wrongful dismissal, the main factor is usually how much notice the employee was given before being fired. The Supreme Court of Canada ruled that damages for wrongful dismissal should mainly cover financial losses like lost wages. Compensation for emotional distress is only awarded if it's not directly related to the dismissal itself.\nFor example, if an employee claims emotional distress, the court must decide if the cause of distress would have been enough for a lawsuit even if the firing hadn't occurred.

The statement of claim filed with the Court usually lists the categories for which the employee seeks damages. Often, but not always, the amount of compensation sought for each category of damages is listed. In addition to pay in lieu of notice, dismissed employees may request, in a civil suit, compensation for moving costs; costs to become re-employed, including retraining costs; or loss of company benefits, such as dental plans. The statement of claim may also claim damages for intangibles such as mental distress.\nAfter the employee's lawyer sends a statement of claim (the employee's wish list), the parties and their lawyers may meet and negotiate a settlement out-of-court. Out-of-court settlements are common and avoid the risks and trouble of a trial. Once a settlement has been reached out-of-court, letters of understanding, minutes or memorandum of settlement, settlement agreements, or a final release are prepared. Out-of-court settlements are written by lawyers, and not by a judge or arbitrator. The lawyers are free to phrase the terms of the settlement in any manner that benefits their client. The terms of out-of-court settlements may be very specific, or very general. They rarely place blame, nor accept fault on the part of either the employer or the employee, although in some cases they may appear to do so. After both parties have agreed to the terms of the agreement, a final release is usually signed by the employee, along with the settlement agreement, agreeing to the terms of the settlement, and agreeing not to take any future action.\nIf the parties cannot agree on a settlement, a judge or labour arbitration tribunal hears the case. In the court system, it has long been settled that the principal consideration in assessing damages for wrongful dismissal is the notice period given for the dismissal. In other words, it may not be the dismissal itself that is in dispute, but rather the amount of notice given, or payment in lieu of that notice. This principle was confirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada which ruled that damages for wrongful dismissal should usually be restricted to compensating an employee for damages which are tangible and estimable, for example, wages and other employment-related benefits which are lost when the employment ended (S.C.C Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick, 2008). Damages for wrongful dismissal which are awarded by the courts, are therefore usually confined to putting employees in the financial position they would have been in, had they been given reasonable notice.\nIn the courts, damages for intangibles such as loss of prestige, injury to reputation and emotional upset are usually awarded only when damage arises from an injury that is not related solely to the dismissal itself. For example, if mental distress is claimed, the civil court or the labour arbitration tribunal must consider if the actions complained of are independently actionable (that is, could the claimant sue the employer for mental distress if a dismissal did not occur). The Court reasoned that stress is normal in any dismissal and should not normally be compensated for in suits for damages for wrongful dismissal.",0.9555167
290,290,290,"Damages for wrongful dismissal are usually money paid to make up for lost income when someone is fired unfairly. These payments are considered to be from employment unless there's clear proof they aren't for lost wages or work-related benefits. Unless proven otherwise, the people in charge can assume that these payments don't include money for things like damage to someone's reputation or emotional distress. 

If a payment is not directly related to specific benefits someone got while working, it's not counted as earnings. Wages and job benefits like insurance paid by the boss are seen as tangible job advantages. So, getting a payment to make up for losing those wages or benefits while employed is counted as earnings. But getting money for something intangible, like emotional stress, isn't earnings because that's not making up for lost wages or job benefits. Payments for medical bills are never considered earnings for benefits, because they're not meant to replace lost income from a job. 

There might be cases where someone claims a payment was not for lost wages or work-related benefits, but for other reasons like ending a dispute, ending a lawsuit, or making up for changes in career status. These claims might not be accepted if there isn't clear proof the payment wasn't to replace wages or job benefits.",64.96820588235295,9.68782352941177,11.003577315987393,12.27891402714932,12.274886877828052,11.143167420814478,50.60678733031674,6.3,0.8896255956755744,0.8803032636642456,2.849980871927164,0.5654662536634164,0.4806220640210409,0.0580989808862814,4.8099547511312215,5.0,2.3302244852800547,22.1,20.5,5.5578772926361015,1.411764705882353,1.0,0.6435528216311683,221,103,0.4660633484162896,1110,10,5.12.11.2,Compensation other than for the loss of income from employment,Chapter 5 - Earnings,"Damages for wrongful dismissal are presumed to be compensation for the loss of income from employment, and are therefore earnings arising out of employment, unless it can reasonably be concluded that the money does not represent lost wages or lost employment-related benefits. Unless there is clear evidence to the contrary, the Commission may presume that awards do not usually contain monetary compensation for intangibles such as loss of prestige, injury to reputation, or emotional upset (CUB 65078; FCA A-231-95, CUB 27115).\nAny part of an award for damages, which is not related to the direct and tangible advantages received by the claimant during employment, is not earnings. Wages and employment-related benefits such as premiums paid by the employer for insurance-type benefits, can be considered tangible advantages of employment. Therefore, an award to compensate for the loss of those wages or employment-related benefits received during employment, is earnings. An award for an intangible, such as mental distress, is not earnings because compensation for the loss of one's health is not compensation for lost wages, nor is it compensation for loss of an employment-related benefit. An award not related to the advantages of employment is not earnings for benefit purposes (CUB 51759). Payments for medical expenses are never earnings for EI benefit purposes, as they are not meant to compensate the employee for the loss of income from employment. The treatment of expenses, such as legal fees, relocation expenses or retraining expenses, which may form part of an award, is covered in another section (Digest 5.12.2.1; Digest 5.12.11.4).\nFrequently claimants will allege that a settlement was not for lost wages, or for other advantages related to employment, but to buy peace and avoid a trial, as a compromise to terminate controversy, for damages for a loss of career, or for a change in status (CUB 57295; CUB 47851). These arguments may be unsuccessful for 2 reasons; First, the name given to a payment does not necessarily define its true nature. Second, the onus is on the claimant to show that an award was not intended to compensate for the loss of wages and other employment-related benefits.",0.9875103
291,291,291,"When a case goes to court or labor arbitration and the judge distributes the money awarded into different categories, we can generally trust that the judge got it right (CUB 47918). The judge's decisions are usually clear and accurate, so we shouldn't doubt them, even if some of the money compensates the person for other things besides lost wages or work benefits. Any money given for lost wages or work benefits is considered earnings. 

A Consent Order is not a decision made by the court after a hearing. Rather, it's a ruling that confirms an agreement made by both parties. 

Sometimes, in court or arbitration, the judgment might just give a total amount of money without breaking it down. In this case, the commission might assume that the whole amount is considered earnings from work and then give the whole amount to the person, minus any expenses they had to pay to get it (like legal fees) (EIR 35(10)(a)).

If a case doesn't go to court but is settled outside of it, the agreement might just mention a final dollar amount without much detail. In this situation, the entire settlement amount, minus any legal fees, is seen as earnings from work. 

However, if the agreement is very detailed, lawyers usually write it to meet their clients' needs. They might mention in the agreement that most of the money isn't for lost income from work. But since courts usually only give money for things related to work benefits, any out-of-court settlement that claims to give very little or no money for lost work income needs to be looked at carefully.

The person making the claim must show that the money was given for reasons other than lost wages or work benefits, like moving expenses or training costs. Merely saying the money wasn't for work-related losses isn't enough. Evidence should be in the final agreement or lawyer communications (CUB 78803). The person should also prove that the injury, damage, or expenses claimed actually happened and that the payment was reasonable for those reasons. 

To exclude money from being considered earnings for lost work income, the person must prove that the employer agreed to pay for other reasons. Receipts and clear, uncontested statements from the employer are normally good proof. But if it seems like the employer and employee are working together to avoid following the law, the settlement should be looked at closely. 

Unless there is clear evidence that the settlement isn't just for lost employment income, most of the settlement is seen as earnings (CUB 51759).",71.76426724137933,8.652959770114943,9.888512548439396,11.274712643678162,11.381689655172416,10.225011494252872,42.20977011494253,4.45,0.8309875256136844,0.8272741271389855,2.8858554699700667,0.690721042249323,0.4682508125067109,0.0604552265764854,4.657471264367816,4.0,2.324266399350831,21.75,21.5,8.560811877386396,1.335632183908046,1.0,0.6269754090567645,435,188,0.432183908045977,2105,20,5.12.11.3,The EI process and damages,Chapter 5 - Earnings,"When a case proceeds to court or labour arbitration, and the text of the judgement allocates the amounts awarded to various categories, the judgement can usually be relied upon as an accurate representation of what the award actually represents (CUB 47918). Such clearly worded judgements should not be questioned, even if all or part of the award compensates the claimant for damages unrelated to the loss of wages or employment-related benefits. Any moneys paid for the loss of wages and employment-related benefits are earnings. It should be noted that a Consent Order is not a decision of the court made after a hearing, but rather it is a ruling confirming agreement reached by the 2 parties.\nOften, the text of the court or labour arbitration judgement is not specific and simply awards a lump sum. In these cases, the Commission may assume that the entire award is earnings arising out of employment, and allocate the entire lump sum , less any applicable expenses incurred to obtain it  (for example, legal expenses) (EIR 35(10)(a)).\nWhen the matter does not proceed to a court or labour arbitration tribunal, and an out-of-court settlement is reached, the memorandum of settlement and final release may be very general and assign only a final dollar value for the damages sought. When this is the case, the entire amount of the out-of-court settlement, less any applicable legal expenses, is considered earnings arising out of employment and is allocated.\nConversely, the final agreement may contain very specific details. Memorandums of settlement are written by lawyers, whose job is to respond to the needs of their clients. To benefit their clients they may indicate in the documents that all or most of the money paid by the employer is for reasons other than the loss of income from employment. Keeping in mind that the courts usually restrict themselves to awarding damages for tangibles related to benefits received during employment, any out-of-court settlement that claims that very little or no amount is to compensate for lost employment income, must be carefully examined.\nIt is not enough for a claimant to allege that an out-of-court settlement is not compensation for the loss of wages or other employment-related benefits. Jurisprudence has long held that the onus is on the claimant to show that the money was paid for other reasons, such as unpaid wages, moving expenses, retraining expenses, or for the relinquishment of the right to be reinstated (FCA A-140-03, CUB 56407). Claims or allegations made in a Statement of Claim are not considered proof that the employer has agreed to compensate the claimant for anything other than loss of wages.\nTo exclude money from the category of earnings paid to compensate for the loss of employment income, the claimant must establish that the payment was requested for other reasons, and that the employer agreed to compensate the claimant for those reasons (for example, injury, damage or expenses). Proof may be included in the final release or in correspondence between lawyers (CUB 78803). In addition, the claimant must show that the injury, damage or expenses claimed actually occurred, and that the payment and the amount were reasonable in light of the injury, damage or expenses. For example, if mental distress is claimed, the Commission may reasonably expect that the claimant sought professional help to deal with the distress. If this were not done, the claimant's allegation would be less credible. Receipts for expenses, which the employer agreed to pay for in the wrongful dismissal suit, are adequate proof that the money was paid to compensate for something other than the loss of employment income and benefits.\nThe employer must also confirm that the payment was not fully or partly for lost employment income. A straightforward, clear and uncontradicted statement is acceptable unless the employer's confirmation appears to arise out of collusion with the employee, and the intent is to circumvent the EI Act. Likewise, if the employer's statement appears to be motivated by a desire to accommodate the employee, the out-of-court settlement should be examined carefully.\nIt is rare that any portion of an out-of-court settlement is not considered earnings when it is written in very general terms. This only happens when the evidence clearly demonstrates that the settlement is not solely for lost employment-related income (CUB 51759).",0.9605378

If the money awarded is not enough to cover all the legal costs, the extra costs can be taken out of the settlement. If a settlement includes both money for lost wages and money not counted as regular income, only the legal fees connected to getting the lost wages can be taken out.

Legal costs or expenses include lawyer's fees, as well as court costs, disbursements and other legitimate expenses directly related to the legal action. As long as the claimant actually incurred expenses in connection with the action taken against the employer, that portion of a payment is not considered earnings for the purposes of EI benefits. This is because the amount paid specifically to reimburse legal expenses is not intended to cover lost wages or employment-related benefits.\nSometimes the amount awarded may not be sufficient to cover actual legal costs, or no special amount is awarded. If the claimant provides proof that the legal costs exceeded the amount awarded for legal costs, or no amount was awarded for the entire amount of the legal costs, those costs are deducted from the settlement. This is because they were incurred for the direct purpose of receiving that income (EIR 35(10)(a); Digest 5.3.3.2). However, if a settlement includes both income replacement and sums not considered earnings for EI purposes, only the amount of the legal fees incurred to recover the income replacement portion of the settlement can be deducted. This amount is obtained by using the percentage that the income replacement portion is, of the total award amount received. This may be adjusted if the claimant can establish that the amount paid to recover the income replacement portion was higher than the calculated proportional amount (CUB 34664).\nThe claimant cannot include the value of their own time or personal expenses, expended to resolve a wrongful dismissal suit (CUB 72033).

293,293,293,"When an employee does something wrong at work, the employer can choose different ways to deal with it, like firing them right away, suspending them with or without pay while investigating, or giving them a warning. Employees also have choices, such as disputing the action taken against them or claiming they were wrongfully fired. Any money paid to the employee during a suspension or after being fired can affect their ability to claim benefits.

If an employee is let go or laid off, any money they receive is linked to the date when they stopped working. If someone is suspended without pay and then fired or quits, the reasons for leaving are connected to when they were first suspended. For example, any vacation pay received during a suspension needs to be considered in a way that doesn't exceed their normal pay rate.

Sometimes, after being suspended or fired, the employer and employee may agree that the punishment was too harsh. In such cases, the suspension time might be reduced, or the employee may get their job back. If the employer compensates the employee for wages lost during the suspension, that money is linked to the period immediately after the shortened suspension, not the original suspension.

The employee also has several options that may include grieving the action, or starting an action for wrongful dismissal. Any earnings paid in relation to the suspension or dismissal would be allocated and could affect a claim for benefits.\nEarnings paid or payable by reason of a lay-off or separation must be allocated from the date of the event that gave right to the money. When an employee is suspended or on a leave of absence without pay and is later fired or resigns, the termination of employment is related to the initial suspension or leave of absence (CUB 30296).

As a result, the period of suspension may be shortened, or the employee may be reinstated. If the employer then pays the employee an amount to cover lost wages for the period following the amended suspension period, these earnings are allocated to the period immediately following the period during which the claimant was actually suspended and not from the date of the original suspension (EIR 36(11)).

294,294,294,"An employee can complain if they are fired without a good reason, if there is mistreatment, or if they experience bullying at work. After such a complaint, the employee might get money instead of getting their job back. This can happen under certain labor laws. The employee and the employer might agree that it's better to settle the situation with money rather than rehiring the employee.

If the employee can't get their job back due to the law, but they go to court and win compensation, it's because they were wrongly fired, not because they gave up their job rights. Courts can't force an employer to hire back an employee if there's no law or contract that says they must. If an employee gets money for giving up their job rights, it doesn't count as regular earnings for Employment Insurance benefits.

To show that the money was for giving up job rights, the employee must prove three things:

1. They had the right to get their job back.
2. They tried to get their job back.
3. The money was specifically for giving up the job rights.

Any money received as part of a deal when there's no right to get the job back is seen as compensation for lost wages.

Following an award resulting from this grievance, the employee may receive an amount as compensation for relinquishing their right to reinstatement, in compliance with an order by the relevant authority (FCA A-140-03, CUB 56407). A reinstatement can also be ordered within the framework of a complaint filed under other legislations governing human rights, occupational health and safety, victim-related legislations or electoral laws.\nIn some cases, reinstatement may not be the most appropriate measure and another form of redress should be considered. In such situations, an agreement or settlement may be reached between the parties in which the employer offers to compensate the employee for relinquishing their reinstatement rights.\nIn order for an employee to be able to receive compensation for relinquishing their right to recall, it is essential that a right to reinstatement exist in the first place, be it under federal, provincial or territorial legislation, or under a contract or collective agreement.  It must also be clearly established that the moneys were paid in compensation for the relinquishment of that right.\nIf the employee does not have the right to ask for reinstatement under legislation or a collective agreement, but pursues wrongful dismissal action through the courts, any amounts granted by the Court constitute damages for wrongful dismissal, and not for the relinquishment of the right to be reinstated (Digest 5.12.11). A court does not have the authority to issue a reinstatement order where there is no right to reinstatement under federal, provincial or territorial legislation, or under a contract or collective agreement.\nMoneys paid to an employee pursuant to legislation or a collective agreement, for the relinquishment of reinstatement rights do not constitute earnings for EI benefit purposes. It is not necessary to know whether it was the employee or the employer who initiated the relinquishment of the reinstatement rights.\nUnlike moneys paid in compensation for wrongful dismissal, which are paid to cover the period the individual would have worked had they not been dismissed, moneys paid for the express purpose of the relinquishment of reinstatement rights are excluded from earnings. This is because these moneys were not earned by labour or given in return for work done.\nTo establish that the moneys were paid in exchange for the relinquishment of reinstatement rights, the claimant must provide an explanation and proof that the following 3 criteria were met:\n\n1. The right to reinstatement existed\n\nThe right to reinstatement must exist under the federal legislation, under provincial or territorial legislation, or under the clauses of the claimant's work contract or collective agreement.\nThe right to reinstatement can also include any other employment protection measure, such as separate and negotiable bumping or call-back rights, which an employer must uphold under a collective agreement.\nHowever, when an agreement between the parties provides for compensation in exchange for the relinquishment of reinstatement rights, it is the very existence of the right to reinstatement, and not the wording of the agreement, that determines whether the moneys can be excluded as earnings. If the right does not exist, the claimant cannot be compensated for relinquishing it.\n\n2. The employee sought reinstatement\n\nThe employee must have sought reinstatement either through a grievance or an application submitted under legislation. The grievance filed, the application submitted under legislation, or the correspondence between the parties must indicate that the employee was seeking reinstatement. The wording of a grievance is generally clear about whether the employee was seeking to be reinstated.\nThe situation is sometimes less clear in cases relating to labour standards legislation. In Quebec for example, complaint forms for recourse against dismissal without good and sufficient cause, prohibited practice, and psychological harassment, do not mention whether the employee requested reinstatement. However, such a request is implicit with the filing of a complaint because the relevant sections of the labour standards legislation seek the employee's reintegration.\n\n3. The moneys were paid to compensate the relinquishment of the right to reinstatement\n\nThe fact that the parties have given a label to the damages is not enough; there must be conclusive proof. In all situations where a claimant obtained an agreed settlement, a copy of the agreement between the parties must be provided. This settlement agreement must support the allegation that the right to reinstatement exists, that reinstatement was sought, that the right was relinquished, and that the moneys paid by the employer were compensation for the relinquishment of reinstatement rights. In some cases, additional supporting documents, as well as the correspondence between the parties, could be required to substantiate the allegation.\nWhen the result of a negotiation or mediation process is that an employee relinquishes, rather than claims their reinstatement rights before being reinstated, and the amount paid is based on the relinquishment of that right, the wording of the settlement agreement or of the supporting documents, must support the allegation that:\n\nthe right to reinstatement exists\nreintegration was sought\nthat right was relinquished, and\nthe moneys paid by the employer were compensation for the relinquishment of the reinstatement rights\n\nIn fact, it must be clearly demonstrated that the moneys were paid in compensation for the relinquishment of reinstatement rights, and that the employer had no choice but to place a monetary value on that right.\n\n\nAny compensation received as part of an agreement when no right to reinstatement exists will be considered as compensation for loss of wages, and will be allocated in the same way as earnings received upon separation from employment (EIR 35; EIR 36).  However, if the claimant proves that part or all of the compensation was paid because of special circumstances, such as the reimbursement of professional or legal fees, relocation costs, retraining or job search costs, or damages for pain and suffering, those amounts will not be allocated (FCA A-567-99, CUB 42598A).

295,295,295,"Pension money you get from a job is considered as income for benefit purposes. This applies whether you receive the pension money regularly or as a lump sum. Since pensions are usually paid after you stop working, there are some special rules that apply to how they are handled. 

Pension earnings do not stop the interruption of other earnings and can be counted along with other money you make. But the money you get from a pension doesn't affect how other earnings are split up for weeks when you receive pension payments. 

Once you are paid or can get the money from a pension plan, it will be counted as income, no matter what you choose to do with it. Getting money from a pension plan might affect your eligibility for employment insurance benefits, even if you move the money to a retirement plan at your request. 

Locked-in pension credits are money in a retirement fund that guarantees a pension under the plan. Depending on the type of pension plan, these credits could be contributions plus interest or the estimated value of the pension. Usually, this money can't be taken out as cash when you leave a job; it can only be paid out as a pension. 

The way pension money is allocated depends on whether it is paid regularly or as a lump sum instead of regular payments. 

If you have enough work hours to qualify for employment benefits when you start receiving a pension, the pension money won't be counted as part of your earnings. 

While money from a pension that comes from contributions and interest is considered earnings, the way it is allocated depends on the type of contributions.

Pension earnings are allocated and may prevent the payment of EI benefits, even if they are transferred to a RRSP at the claimant's request. Whether the RRSP is locked-in and non-commutable is not relevant. However, locked-in pension credits that are directly transferred to another locked-in vehicle are not considered paid or payable until they are withdrawn from these locked-in vehicles (Digest 5.13.2; Digest 5.13.7). Locked-in pension credits are the moneys in a pension fund that support a member's pension entitlement under the plan. For defined contribution pension plans, these credits are the contributions made to the pension fund, plus accumulated interest. For defined benefit pension plans, these credits are the commuted value of the pension to be paid. In most cases, locked-in pension credits cannot be refunded in cash on termination of employment; they can only be paid as a pension benefit.\nPensions are allocated to the period for which they are paid or payable, regardless of the method of payment, or when the payment is made. The manner of allocating pension moneys depends on whether a pension is paid on a periodic basis, or in a lump sum in lieu of a pension (EIR 36(14); EIR 36(15); EIR 36(17)).\nPensions are not considered earnings if, after the date the pension became payable, the claimant has accumulated a sufficient number of hours of insurable employment that would allow them to establish a benefit period (Digest 5.13.13). The benefit period during which the pension is to be exempted must be based on insured hours that include these hours.\nAlthough not pension earnings, refunds of the employer or employee contributions into a pension fund and the accumulated interest are earnings arising out of employment (EIR 35(2)). The method for allocating these earnings varies according to the type of contributions being returned. A refund of the employee contributions on termination is allocated back to the period of employment (EIR 36(4); Digest 5.13.8.1). These moneys would have formed part of the claimant's gross weekly earnings during the period of employment and therefore would have no effect on the payment of EI benefits. A refund of the employer contributions is allocated as earnings paid or payable by reason of separation (that is, starting from the week of separation, at normal weekly earnings) (EIR 36(9); Digest 5.13.8.2).",0.9689023

297,297,297,"Pension plans need to be registered under either provincial or federal laws, as well as with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) because of tax laws. The pension plan rules must follow both the pension laws and the limits set for pension benefits by the CRA. The pension laws state what the plan must do at a minimum, while the tax laws set the maximum. The people in charge of these laws control what can be put into the plan, how money can be taken out, and what happens to the money in the plan.

For certain groups like federal government workers, Canadian Armed Forces members, RCMP officers, and members of parliament, separate pension plans are made under federal laws. These plans must still follow the tax rules, but they don't have to follow the same pension rules about when benefits can be taken out.

Almost every province, except for Prince Edward Island, has its laws that say what must be in their pension plans. The federal Pension Benefits Standards Act is for employees who work in federally regulated industries, like Crown corporations, banks, railways, airlines, and more. Where the employee works decides which laws apply. These laws say the least that a plan must offer, but plans can give better benefits if they follow the CRA limits.

Pension plans need to say when benefits are given and what rights employees have when they leave their job. Employees may have their pension money locked in, transferred to another account, get a refund of the money they put in, get a refund of both their money and their employer's contribution, or get a deferred annuity.

These laws can change over time. The rules for money put into the plan will depend on when the contributions were made, before or after any law changes.

Any provisions in the pension plan must comply with not only any applicable pension legislation, but also with the conditions and limitations on pension benefits, imposed by CRA through the Income Tax Act. In general, the pension legislation sets the minimum provisions a plan must contain, and the Income Tax Act sets the maximum. During the entire time the pension fund is in operation, the authorities who administer this legislation control what may go into the plan, what may come out, how it may come out, and what happens while the moneys are in the plan.\nPension plans that cover all federal government employees, employees of the Canadian Armed Forces, the RCMP, and members of parliament, are established by separate federal legislation. The legislation setting up these pension plans is subject to the Income Tax Act and must meet all the income tax provisions. However, it is not subject to the federal or provincial pension legislation regarding provisions related to vesting and lock in.\nAll provinces, except Prince Edward Island, have pension legislation that sets out the provisions that must be contained in each province's registered pension plan. The Pension Benefits Standards Act of the Government of Canada applies to the employees of any province who are under federal jurisdiction. This includes employees of Crown corporations, banks, railways, airlines, shipping companies, radio stations, communication companies, and employees of the Canadian territories. The applicable provincial legislation is determined by the location of the employee's work site. The provisions required by the federal or provincial legislation are the minimum that must be met; however, any plan can offer more generous terms within the limits set by CRA. In addition, plans for an employer whose operations span several provinces must meet the conditions set out in each of those provincial acts. An employer may achieve this by adopting the provisions of the most generous provincial legislation, or they may have separate sections in the plan containing the provisions for employees in each province. It is important that the particular provisions of the employer's pension plan are known, so that the true nature of the moneys, and the conditions under which they are being paid, can be determined.\nIn addition to defining the benefits that are payable on retirement, every pension plan must also define when pensions are payable, and the benefits and rights of the employees upon termination of their services. These rights may include having the locked-in pension credits transferred to a locked-in vehicle, having the right to a refund of their own contributions, a refund of their own and their employer's contributions, or a deferred annuity.\nSome provincial legislation, as well as federal legislation, periodically undergo changes. Contributions made prior to the effective date of any changes in legislation may have one set of rules regarding when contributions are vested and locked in, and contributions made on or after the date of changes may have a different set of rules. The relevant dates and their provisions can be found in the pension plan itself.",0.99763703
298,298,298,"Pension plans come in different types to meet various needs. They all aim to provide benefits to individuals. These plans need to follow specific rules from the government related to taxes and pensions laws. Some pension plans are not registered under tax laws, which means no tax deductions can be made on the contributions to these plans.

Employers and employees have different roles in pension plans depending on the type of plan. In some plans, both employees and employers contribute money, while in others only the employer contributes. The money put into the pension fund earns interest over time.

The main goal of a pension plan is to provide income for retired individuals. However, having a pension doesn't always mean a person stops working altogether. Not all employees who contribute to a pension plan will stay with the same employer until retirement. Whether they receive benefits if they leave early depends on the rules of vesting and locking in their contributions.

Vesting means an employee has the right to get some benefits from the pension plan after working for a certain period. Locking in contributions means the money cannot be taken out in a lump sum, only paid as a pension later on. The rules for vesting and locking in contributions vary in different plans.

Employees usually get back their own contributions if they leave employment, as long as those contributions are not locked in. Employer contributions are subject to conditions before they can be received. Pension plans often allow transfers of locked-in funds to similar accounts in certain situations.

When employees reach retirement age, they can access their locked-in funds as a pension. Employees need to apply to receive their pension benefits; it's not automatically paid out. The timing and method of receiving pension benefits depend on the specific rules of the pension plan.",63.10424361022366,8.345448881789139,11.698219412168324,12.01079872204473,9.628993610223642,11.3141214057508,43.76501597444089,4.4,0.8261435816162511,0.8049562010500166,2.436252113684389,0.4474096872087326,0.4727142594247858,0.0840536861084992,4.932907348242812,4.0,2.706984844192375,15.65,15.5,4.077683165720456,1.511182108626198,1.0,0.8234014673420935,313,145,0.463258785942492,1579,20,5.13.1.2,Pension plan structure,Chapter 5 - Earnings,"Pension plans are as varied as the needs of the individuals they cover. However, generally, all pension plans share the same purpose and have some similar provisions regarding the payment of benefits. The similarities arise from the fact that the plans must meet the demands of diverse legislation; the Income Tax Act and the applicable federal or provincial pension legislation. However, retirement plans may exist which are not registered under the Income Tax Act. As no income tax deduction is possible for any contributions made to such a plan, these plans are not very common (Digest 5.13.10).\nPension plans may have various requirements for the employer and employees depending on the type of plan. A contributory plan requires employees to contribute, and the employer to pay the balance of the costs. In a non-contributory plan, the employer pays the full cost. If required, contributions made by the employee are collected by the employer, usually by way of a payroll deduction from the employee's gross pay, and placed in the pension fund. The employer's contributions go directly into the fund. The employer contributions do not form part of the employee's gross earnings, and are not included for the purposes of calculating income tax, EI premiums, and CPP contributions. While in the pension fund, both employer and employee contributions accumulate interest.\nThe purpose of a pension plan is to provide a pension benefit upon retirement. Retirement may be at an early retirement age or at normal retirement age; however it is important to note that receiving a pension from an employment does not necessarily mean that the individual is retiring from all employment (Digest 5.13.5.1). Contributing to a pension plan does not necessarily guarantee a pension, as not all employees remain employed by the same employer until retirement age. Some employees may work for an employer and contribute to the plan for a short time. The benefits, if any, that are payable to an employee who leaves employment prior to retirement age, depend on whether vesting and lock-in of the pension contributions have occurred.\nVesting is the employee's right to receive some sort of benefit under the pension plan (Digest 5.13.2). Normally, this vested benefit takes the form of either a return of the contributions made to the plan and the accumulated interest, or a deferred pension (an annuity). Whether contributions are vested under the terms of a pension plan depends on the length of employment with that employer. The type of benefit or the nature of the benefit that the employee receives, a refund of contributions or a deferred pension, depends on whether lock-in has occurred.\nThe locking in of contributions simply means that they can no longer be refunded in a lump sum, as a return of contributions. As such, the only benefit that can be paid by the pension fund, based on those contributions, is an immediate or deferred pension. Furthermore, that pension can only be paid upon reaching a specified retirement age. The locking in of contributions, like vesting, depends on the length of time employed, and is set out in the provisions of the plan. While vesting establishes the right to a benefit under the plan, locking in restricts access to that benefit until the specified retirement age is reached. Vesting usually occurs at the same time as lock-in, although it can occur earlier. The actual pension plan will describe at what point vesting and lock-in occur.\nReturn of contributions, whether the employer's or employee's, can only occur when these contributions are not locked in. In addition, to be refunded, the employee must have a vested right to these contributions. Under all pension plans, vesting occurs immediately for the employee's own contributions. This means, no matter how long the employee has been employed, as long as these contributions are not locked in, they can receive all of their own contributions and the accumulated interest, upon termination of employment. If these contributions are locked in, they cannot be refunded as they will be used to support the payment of a pension at retirement age. If the pension plan permits vesting to occur earlier than lock-in, the employee may be entitled to a lump-sum payment of the employer contributions and the accumulated interest, as well as to the return of their own contributions.\nThe provisions of a particular pension plan may allow vesting of the employer's portion of the pension contributions to be contingent on certain factors (conditional). This means that full benefits from both the employer's and employee's contributions are only paid if a certain option is chosen (the deferred pension). Contingent vesting therefore prevents the immediate payment of the employer contributions.\nThe term pension credits refers to contributions and the accumulated interest that are locked in and can no longer be refunded in cash, on termination of employment. Therefore, a benefit from these pension credits can only be paid as a pension. However, this does not mean that these pension credits have to remain with that employer's pension plan until the employee reaches retirement age. Pension plans allow for some degree of portability (transferability) of pension credits (Digest 5.13.2; Digest 5.13.7). The condition on the transfer of these credits is that they must move directly from one locked-in vehicle to another, and must remain locked in until retirement age is reached. As long as these conditions are met, a transfer may be made. Eligible locked-in vehicles can be another employer's pension plan (if the other plan so permits); a locked-in non-commutable RRSP, or its equivalent (provincial locked-in retirement account (LIRA) or Quebec's compte de retraite immobilisÃƒÂ© (CRI)); or an annuity purchase contract.\nUpon reaching either normal retirement age or an early retirement age, as set out in the plan, employees may access their locked-in pension credits as a pension. Pension plans require that employees apply for their pension, as it is not paid automatically upon reaching retirement age. Employees can delay the start of their pensions to a time of their choosing, however, it cannot begin later than the maximum age allowed by legislation. This also applies to locked-in vehicles. Whether a pension is paid periodically as an annuity, or as a lump-sum pension payment, depends on the provisions of the pension plan (Digest 5.13.6).",0.98908794

Defined benefit plans determine the pension amount a retired employee will receive based on a set formula. The contributions made during employment are aimed at building up a fund that can support this pension. If there is a shortfall, the employer is responsible for covering it. There are 3 types of defined benefit plans: Final Earnings Plan, Career Average Earnings Plan, and Flat Benefit Plan.

Defined contribution plans specify how much money will be contributed, but the actual pension amount is not known until retirement. There are 2 types: Money Purchase Plan and Profit Sharing Plan.

These categories depend on whether the pension is defined on the basis of a set formula (that is, a defined benefit), a set level of contributions (that is, a defined contribution), or a combination of the 2 (that is, a hybrid or combination).\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans specify the formula for calculating the pension that will be paid to the employee on retirement. Contribution rates are then established during the years employed to provide for a sum of money on retirement that will be able to support the payment of that pension. Any shortfalls, between what the accumulated contributions would support as a pension and the pension to which that employee is entitled, must be made up by the employer. There are 3 types of defined benefit pension plans:\n\n\nFinal Earnings Pension Plan\nthe pension is based on the member's length of service and average earnings for a stated period before retirement, for example: 2% multiplied by the number of years of service multiplied by an average of the member's earnings during the last or best five consecutive years of service.\n\n\nCareer Average Earnings Pension Plan\nthe pension is equal to a percentage of the aggregate earnings in the member's entire career. For example: 2% of the aggregate earnings during the employee's period of service\n\n\nFlat (or Uniform) Benefit Pension Plan\nthe pension is based on a specified number of dollars for each year of service. For example: $40 per month for each year of service would yield a pension of $1200 per month for someone with 30 years of service\n\n\nDefined Contribution Pension Plans specify the contribution rate. Whatever money is in the fund on retirement will be used to purchase an annuity. There are 2 types of defined contribution pension plans:\n\n\nMoney Purchase (Defined Contribution) Pension Plan\nthe contribution amount is specified, however the pension amount is not known until the employee retires. For example: 5% of the employee's salary per year from both the employer and the employee, reduced by the required contributions under CPP and QPP. The amount of pension that these contributions will be able to purchase as an annuity will not be known until the employee retires\n\n\nProfit Sharing Pension Plan\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthe employer contributes an amount that varies each year with the profits earned.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is allocated to each member on a point system. Taxation authorities require that the employer make a minimum contribution, equal to at least 1% of remuneration of plan members in any year. The amount of pension that these contributions will provide will not be known until the employee retires\n\n\nHybrid or Combination Plans include characteristics of both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.

Each payment represents a partial return of the capital invested and a return on the capital investment (commonly called interest).\n\n\nCommuted value\nTo commute something in a financial sense is to convert it to cash. The commuted value of a pension represents the cash equivalent of what that pension would have been, if paid in a lump-sum payment. It is the value of the monthly pension payments to be made in the future, converted into a fixed or gross amount (a cash lump-sum settlement) (Digest 5.13.6.2).\n\n\nLocked in\nLocked in means that the contributions to the plan cannot be withdrawn by the employee, and the employee can only receive the benefit of those contributions in the form of a pension, at retirement. The employer and the employee portion of the pension fund contributions must stay in the fund, and cannot be refunded. Although they can't be refunded, they may be transferred to another locked-in vehicle. Locked-in pension contributions may also be referred to as pension credits.\nThrough vesting, an employee establishes a right to receipt of the contributions. The lock-in provisions limit what the employee can do with the contributions to which they have a vested right; that is, they cannot receive them in cash until retirement age is reached. There are exceptions to the locking-in rule, and if the terms of the particular plan permit, the employee may receive a cash sum. These exceptions occur when the periodic pension amount that the employee is entitled to is below a set limit, when there is a shorter than normal life expectancy, when partial commutation is allowed by legislation, when Additional Voluntary Contributions are returned (Digest 5.13.9.1), or when provisions exist regarding Maximum Funding by Employee Contributions (Digest 5.13.8.1).\nWhen identifying moneys paid out of a pension fund, any payout of pension moneys prior to lock-in is normally a return of contributions, whereas any payment after lock-in has occurred is generally a lump-sum pension benefit.\n\n\nLocked-in, non-commutable RRSP\nA locked-in, non-commutable RRSP, or its equivalent (LIRA, CRI), is a financial vehicle that can be likened to a portable pension plan. A non-commutable RRSP is one that can never be de-registered. The full value of the RRSP cannot be obtained in a lump sum, which is why it is said to be non-commutable. These types of RRSPs can only be used to purchase an annuity. An RRSP will be recognized as both locked-in and non-commutable when the RRSP agreement is accompanied by an additional guarantee: both the claimant and the financial institution guarantee that the funds in the RRSP will never be used for any purpose other than to purchase a monthly annuity at retirement age. Additional information regarding the consequences these RRSPs have on whether they are considered payable for the purposes of EI benefits, is available in section 5.13.7 of this chapter.\nSuch a locked-in, non-commutable RRSP is distinguishable from a personal, collapsible RRSP used as an individual investment tool. Personal RRSPs may or may not require the funds to be locked-in for a specific term, in order for the individual to gain a specific rate of return or growth for the investment. As the entire amount of personal RRSP funds belongs to the claimant, they may receive them at any time by collapsing the RRSP and converting it into cash, even if a penalty may be assessed by the financial institution for doing so before the end of the specified term.\n\n\nLocked-in vehicle\nA locked-in vehicle is a financial instrument designed so that moneys contained within it can only be used to pay a pension on retirement. The locked-in vehicles from which most provincial pension legislation allow the transfer of pension credits (locked-in contributions) are:\n\nanother employer's Registered Pension Plan (RPP), if there is a provision for this transfer in the other employer's pension plan\na prescribed RRSP that is both locked-in and non-commutable, or its equivalent, such as a LIRA, or CRI which have all the same provisions, and\nan annuity purchase contract\n\n\n\nPortability\nPortability means that the commuted value of a terminating employee's pension may be transferred to another locked-in vehicle. Most pension plans give a terminating employee the right to have the commuted value of the vested pension transferred to a locked-in vehicle.\n\n\nVesting\nVesting is the right of an employee to a benefit from the pension plan, on termination of employment. Vesting allows the employee to retain a pension (or the value thereof), even if the employee leaves the plan before a pension benefit is immediately payable. The length of time an employee must be employed before vesting is allowed is set out in the pension legislation and the pension plan. Normally, this vested benefit takes the form of either a return of contributions made to the plan and any accumulated interest, or a deferred pension. What the employee receives on termination of employment depends on whether the contributions are locked in. According to pension legislation, vesting normally occurs at the same time as lock-in, however, individual pension plans may provide vesting at an earlier date.\nIf the contributions have become locked in by the terms of the pension plan or pension legislation, the employer and employee contributions cannot be refunded. They must remain with the fund to support the payment of the deferred pension that the employee has a vested right to receive at retirement age. If the contributions have not become locked in, they are refunded to the employee on termination of employment.\nThe contributions that may be refundable to an employee on termination depends on whether they were made by the employer or the employee, and the provisions of the pension plan. Employees always have a right to a return of their own contributions, no matter how long they were employed with that particular employer. Therefore, vesting is always immediate for employee contributions. However, whether there is a right to the employer contributions on leaving employment depends on the terms of the pension plan and the employee's length of employment with that employer. If the pension plan allows vesting to occur prior to lock-in, and the employee was employed the required length of time, the employer contributions are refunded.\nThe provisions of a particular pension plan may allow conditional vesting of the employer's portion of the pension contributions. This means that full benefits from the contributions (that is, the receipt of both employer and employee contributions) occurs only if a certain option is chosen (usually the deferred pension). The plan will indicate whether vesting is conditional or not.",0.9239087
301,301,301,"There is a clear connection between pension payments and the job that led to those payments. The work done for an employer results in pension payments to the employee. This relationship makes those pension payments count as earnings according to a specific law. 

Pensions that come from contributions made by the employer, employee, or both are considered earnings. This applies to pensions from work in Canada or abroad, for jobs that qualify for insurance, or those that don't. Military or police pensions, government pension plans like CPP, and certain annuities count as earnings too.

When examining group annuities from employers' pension plans, a 10-digit contract means it's considered earnings, while a 6-digit one is not. Pension bridging benefits are also seen as earnings, while group RRSPs are not considered pensions for earnings, and the money received is seen as saved earnings from work.

Disability pensions aren't counted as earnings, and some pensions like survivors' benefits, old age security, or pensions from divorce settlements are also excluded. Individually bought RRSPs, private pensions, and additional voluntary contributions fall in the same category of not being counted as earnings.",55.8977146596859,10.207691099476442,12.516099999999998,13.294450261780106,12.681047120418846,13.312460732984292,55.74921465968586,7.0,0.8618619839350382,0.8581347614526749,2.8108315940069177,0.5154078585832582,0.5234744217527091,0.0463119297670698,5.214659685863874,5.0,2.744054928318913,19.1,18.5,4.635730794599704,1.5549738219895288,1.0,0.8350087777985185,191,100,0.5235602094240838,1033,10,5.13.3,Determination,Chapter 5 - Earnings,"A definite link exists between payments to a claimant as a pension, and the employment that gave rise to those payments. It is because of the work that was performed for that employer by the claimant, that the pension payments are being made. That link between pensions and employment is sufficient to support a finding that these payments are earnings pursuant to EIR 35(2)(e). This express provision makes pension income arising out of employment, earnings for benefit purposes (FCA A-178-86).\nOnly those pensions that consist of contributions resulting from employment, and made by the employer, the employee, or a combination of the employer and the employee, are earnings for benefit purposes. Pension payments are earnings whether they are based on employment within Canada, foreign employment, insurable employment, or non-insurable employment (EIR 35(1) - definition of employment). This applies whether the pension plan is registered or non-registered, as long as the pension benefits arise from employment (Digest 5.13.10).\nIncluded in consideration of pension income are pensions that arise from service in any armed forces, or a police force (EIR 35(1) - definition of pension). Also included are pensions paid or payable under the Canada Pension Plan or a provincial pension plan. A pension from a provincial government pension plan is considered earnings for EI purposes, provided that the payment of the pension is based on employment contributions and the attainment of a specific age, or is based on a specific age and years of service formula.\nAnnuities paid pursuant to the Government Annuities Act are considered pension earnings if they are under a group pension certificate as part of an employer's pension plan. A group annuity can be distinguished from an individual annuity by examining the annuity cheque/deposit stub. If the contract is only 6 digits, it is an individually purchased annuity and is exempt from consideration as earnings. If the contract is ten digits (4 then 6), then it is a group annuity arising from employment and will be considered as earnings.\nPension bridging benefits, whether paid from the pension fund or out of general company revenues, are considered a retirement pension arising out of employment, paid on a periodic basis in lieu of a pension (Digest 5.12.7; Digest 5.13.5.2).\nGroup RRSPs are not pension plans for EI purposes, and any moneys arising out of them are considered earned during the period worked. They are simply a collection of individual RRSPs, where the funds are not required by legislation, to be locked-in until retirement, in the same way as pension plans. The ownership of individual accounts is fully and immediately vested in the employees; the employer is only acting as an agent for the employee in the Group RRSPs, when making the deductions and remitting them to the claimant's individual RRSP. Group RRSP monies are considered savings when they are withdrawn from the RRSP. These moneys formed part of the gross earnings during the period the claimant was employed.\nDisability pensions are specifically excluded from consideration as earnings (EIR 35(7)(a); Digest 5.13.14). In addition, the following pensions are not earnings, as they do not meet the definition of pensions arising out of one's employment (EIR 35(1)):\n\nsurvivors' or dependants' pensions\nold age security pensions and supplements\npensions or part of pensions that arise from a divorce settlement, or from spousal assignment of a Canada Pension Plan or Quebec Pension Plan pension (Digest 5.13.12)\nallowances paid to veterans under War Veterans Allowance Act\nmoneys paid for disability under the Veteran's Affairs Charter\nindividually purchased RRSPs, which do not result from the transfer of locked-in pension credits from a pension plan (Digest 5.13.2)\nprivately purchased pension plans or annuities, and\nadditional voluntary contributions (AVCs) (Digest 5.13.9.1)",0.86342967
302,302,302,"It's important to figure out when pension money is actually paid to you. The best places to find this information are the pension plan, the laws about pensions, or details from your employer about what you should receive and when. There are rules about what kind of money comes from a pension fund and how it can be used. The money you get depends on what's explained in the pension plan.

When you get money from your pension, it's clear that it's been paid to you. The plan will show what kind of money it is before the government decides how it affects any benefits you might get. If you have a right to get money now but decide to wait to receive it later, things get a bit more complicated.

For government benefit purposes, money is considered ""payable"" when you legally have the right to it and it should be given to you right away. The specific date when you should get this money is written in the pension plan. The plan sets out when you can retire, how early you can retire, and what money you get if your pension isn't immediately given to you. It also talks about what can be done with the money in your pension if you leave your job.

Even if you've reached the age when you can retire according to the plan, the plan might allow you to put off getting your pension until you ask for it. In this case, the money is not immediately due until you apply for it like the plan says. For instance, if you retire early at 55 but don't want your pension until you're 57 as per the plan, the money is only considered payable when you actually ask for it at 57.",80.17595514950169,7.417591362126249,8.841846274778883,10.460465116279073,8.472956810631228,6.733953488372094,35.45348837209302,3.0,0.8683671401097224,0.8723924358685812,2.785693816780365,0.48712741143459,0.4508297448644475,0.0358133766834112,4.0664451827242525,4.0,1.977171287509308,21.5,21.0,6.253570408745939,1.239202657807309,1.0,0.5611373376934861,301,119,0.3953488372093023,1271,14,5.13.4,Moneys arising out of a pension fund - Paid or payable,Chapter 5 - Earnings,"It is critical to determine at what point pension moneys actually become paid or payable. The best sources of information to do so are the pension plan, the pension legislation, or information provided by the employer regarding the claimant's entitlement and any payments due or made. There are only certain types of moneys that can arise out of a pension fund, and there are limited ways in which they can be handled. These moneys become paid or payable based on specific terms of the pension plan itself.\nThe treatment of moneys actually received by the claimant is straightforward as these moneys are clearly paid. Examination of the terms of the plan will confirm the nature of the moneys received, before they are allocated against an EI claim. However, a closer look is required when the claimant has a legal right to receive moneys immediately, but chooses to defer the payment of these moneys to a later date.\nFor EI purposes, payable means that there is a legal entitlement to the moneys and they are immediately due (Digest 5.6.1). The due date is not open to speculation but is specified in the terms and conditions of the pension plan itself. The plan sets the normal retirement age, early retirement age, and any moneys due on termination, if a pension is not immediately payable. The plan also covers any allowable transfer actions, with respect to the locked-in pension credits in the plan at the time of termination.\nAlthough the claimant may have reached the normal retirement age or an early retirement age as stated in the plan, the plan may make provisions for pension payments to be deferred until the claimant actually applies for it. If the claimant has that choice under the plan and exercises it, these moneys cannot be considered payable (that is, immediately due) until the claimant applies for the pension to be effective a certain date. For example, a claimant retires early at 55 and, according to the provisions of the plan, defers the payment of the pension until age 57. Based on the provisions of the pension plan, the pension is not immediately due until the claimant requests that it start; it is only considered payable at age 57.",0.9721824
303,303,303,"The main goal of a pension plan is to provide income to people who have retired from work. This money, called a pension benefit, is paid regularly, like an allowance, for as long as the retired person is alive. Even if someone stops working at a particular job, they can still receive this income. Typically, the pension benefit is paid in the form of regular payments, known as an annuity. However, sometimes a retired person might get all their pension money at once, instead of in regular payments. This could happen if the amount of monthly pension is very low or if the person is not expected to live for a long time.
To be eligible for a pension benefit, a person must have a certain amount of pension money saved up, must be a certain age, and must apply for the pension. There are exceptions, like if a person stops working before retiring and their pension money becomes available. 
Some pension payments come from a pension fund, whether it follows certain tax rules or not. Also, some payments come from a special account where pension money was moved before. In this case, the money from this special account is considered income when the person starts receiving it.",70.62915584415586,8.150692640692643,9.573946990214177,10.303030303030305,9.310454545454547,9.109523809523813,45.28138528138528,5.0,0.8382058084011078,0.859906276067098,2.8482065391895115,0.4242491642040787,0.4306977751637194,0.076864442617415,4.5,4.0,2.245100485607758,19.09090909090909,18.0,4.640817824763716,1.380952380952381,1.0,0.6230638946208048,210,105,0.5,972,11,5.13.5,Periodic pensions,Chapter 5 - Earnings,"The primary purpose of a pension plan is to provide income support to retired employees in the form of a pension benefit, for the lifetime of the plan member. This does not necessarily mean that the employee is retired from the labour force, but rather, only from that particular employment. Pension legislation defines a pension benefit as an annual, monthly, or other periodic amount to which an employee is, or will be, entitled upon retirement. This periodic payment is commonly called an annuity. Pension benefits, as conceived by pension legislation and the pension plans themselves, are in the form of an annuity payable on retirement, for the life of the employee. However, there are some restricted circumstances where a lump-sum pension benefit may be paid, rather than an annuity. This could happen where the employee's calculated monthly pension amount is below a certain minimum level, or if the employee establishes that their life expectancy is short.\nA pension benefit, whether in the form of an annuity or lump-sum, cannot be received until the claimant establishes that they have locked-in pension credits, have reached a retirement age as specified in the plan, and apply for the pension. An exception occurs when an employee terminates their employment prior to retirement, and locked-in pension credits are unlocked by special provisions in the pension plan (Digest 5.13.6.2).\nIncluded in the category of periodic pensions, are annuity payments that are made out of a pension fund, whether that pension plan is registered under the Income Tax Act or not , as well as payments being made out of a locked-in vehicle to which pension credits had previously been transferred (Digest 5.13.10). Thus, the locked-in, non-commutable RRSP that is subsequently used to purchase an annuity at retirement age is considered earnings when the annuity payments start. The same would be true of any periodic amounts where pension credits were transferred directly from an employer's pension plan to purchase a deferred annuity, and are now paid.",0.9277986
304,304,304,"Pension plans have a set retirement age at which employees can retire and start receiving their full pension. This age usually ranges from 60 to 65 but can be earlier in some cases. This retirement age is different from a mandatory retirement age, which is when an employer requires an employee to retire.

Pension plans also give options for when an employee can start receiving their pension benefits. They can choose to start earlier than the normal retirement age, with some plans allowing deferral of benefits until age 71. If an employee chooses to retire early, they might receive reduced payments based on how many years earlier they start collecting.

Employees need to apply for their pensions at the chosen retirement age, either normal or early retirement. Pensions are not automatically paid out when someone reaches a certain age, unless that age is the maximum allowed by the plan. Employees must meet specific eligibility criteria to qualify for their pension.

If someone of retirement age chooses to collect their pension instead of deferring it, the pension is considered paid. Even if they transfer the pension to another account, like an RRSP, the pension is still considered paid and can impact EI benefits.",60.8127494456763,9.4069623059867,12.872792785125622,13.698447893569847,11.139498891352552,11.638829268292678,50.34368070953437,5.909090909090909,0.836310064792633,0.8460918863614401,2.657560736365084,0.3310776769152722,0.466163603749416,0.0625405415387219,4.9365853658536585,4.0,2.5280626051179187,18.63636363636364,19.0,3.391774201123205,1.502439024390244,1.0,0.7753796253159776,205,108,0.526829268292683,1031,11,5.13.5.1,Retirement age,Chapter 5 - Earnings,"All pension plans set out a normal retirement age. This is the age at which an employee can retire with a full, unreduced pension. Normal retirement age can be anywhere from 60 to 65 years of age. However, some plans may provide a full, unreduced pension at a date earlier than normal retirement age. Normal retirement age simply governs the age at which the unreduced payment of pension benefits can start, under the provisions of the pension plan. Normal retirement age is not the same as a mandatory retirement age. An employer may establish a mandatory retirement age through personnel policies, whereby an employee is forced to resign when they reach that age.\nIn addition to setting out the normal retirement age, pension plans may allow the payment of pension benefits to be either deferred, or paid at an earlier age. If the option to defer the pension benefits is taken, they may be deferred up to age 71. Early retirement age, as set out in a pension plan, is the age at which a member may elect to retire and begin receiving pension payments, prior to reaching normal retirement age. This age may be within ten years of normal retirement age, and may involve the application of an actuarial pension reduction formula to compensate for the extra number of years the pension will be paid.\nAn employee must apply for their pension entitlement, whether it is upon reaching normal retirement or early retirement age. A pension is not automatically payable upon reaching a specified age, unless that age is beyond the maximum allowed under the pension plan. It involves a conscious choice by the employee, and the employee must meet eligibility criteria in terms of pension credits. If the pension plan allows an employee to defer the receipt of their pension to a future date, that pension is not considered payable until the employee applies and qualifies for it. Until this happens, that pension is not considered immediately due and therefore has no impact on EI benefits (Digest 5.6.1).\nIf the claimant is of retirement age and has an option to defer the collection of a pension, but elects to receive it, that pension is considered paid or payable. In addition, if a claimant has no choice under the plan and a pension is immediately due upon reaching a certain age, the pension is considered payable when the retirement age is reached. The determination that the pension is payable does not change if the claimant chooses to make alternate arrangements to dispose of these moneys. Any transfer of that periodic pension into a regular RRSP or a locked-in, non-commutable RRSP does not change the fact that the pension amount is payable, even if it is alleged that the money was never actually physically received (CUB 66832).",0.99795145
305,305,305,"Pension bridging benefits let you get money early that you would usually have to wait for. These benefits are extra payments that help you manage your money better as you move from your current financial situation to a future one. The payments stop when you reach the time you were supposed to get your money originally.

These benefits can come from a pension fund or from the company's money. However, not all extra payments from an employer are considered pension bridging benefits. What matters is if the extra payment follows the rules for being a pension bridging benefit, not where the money comes from.

A pension bridging benefit is a financial help that helps you move from one level of pension payment to a higher one in the future. It can come from the employer's pension fund, the Canada Pension Plan (CPP), or the Quebec Pension Plan (QPP). This extra help keeps the total money received each month constant. You might need this extra help if your original pension is less because of retiring early. It can also encourage people to retire early.

Here are the main things about pension bridging benefits:
- It helps you move from one level of pension to a higher one in the future.
- The extra money is paid regularly.
- You get this help when you reach retirement age.
- The extra payment is about the same as the higher pension you'll get later.

If pension bridging benefits are paid from the company's general money, three extra conditions must be met:
- The time you receive the extra money won't count towards how long you've worked for the company.
- The company's program for these extra payments needs you to meet specific requirements like age, years worked, and retirement date.
- The extra payment won't reduce any severance pay you're owed as per the contract or labor laws.

Sometimes you may be able to choose getting the extra money all at once instead of every month. If a one-time extra payment meets all the other rules for pension bridging benefits, the amount per month will be decided and given out in monthly installments.

Pension bridging benefits are treated like a retirement pension for things like benefits. They can be paid until you start getting your pension or to add to other retirement payments you're receiving.

Remember, pension bridging benefits are not the same as a loan that needs to be paid back. If the extra payment doesn't meet the rules for being a pension bridging benefit, it won't be considered as part of your pension. 

Also, when you no longer get pension bridging benefits but start getting your company pension, your hours worked while getting these benefits might still count towards meeting the requirements for your company pension.",72.47034683544305,7.861362025316456,10.078955797065143,10.706362869198314,9.62259493670886,9.570210970464132,43.43257383966245,4.64,0.8104289472103119,0.7912745825622393,2.5997969507206395,0.519493475091983,0.468022546335045,0.0508905274163936,4.580168776371308,4.0,2.216857921303144,18.96,18.0,7.202666173022321,1.360759493670886,1.0,0.6218763742554685,474,169,0.3565400843881856,2254,25,5.13.5.2,Pension bridging benefits,Chapter 5 - Earnings,"Pension bridging benefits allow an individual earlier access to moneys that normally are only payable at a future date. Bridging benefits, in the form of additional compensation, allow for an easier transition between an individual's present and future financial circumstances. The payment of bridging benefits ceases when the point of planned future compensation is reached.\nBridging benefits can be paid out of a pension fund or out of general company revenue. However, not all bridging benefits paid by an employer are considered pension bridging benefits. The fact that the pension bridging benefit is not paid out of the pension fund is not relevant in determining that it is in fact a pension bridging benefit, when the criteria for a pension bridging benefit has been met.\nA pension bridging benefit is financial payment designed to allow an individual to move from one level of pension compensation to a future level of higher pension compensation with the addition of payments from the employer's pension fund, Canada Pension Plan (CPP) or Quebec Pension Plan (QPP). It is structured so that the total moneys received each month, during the entire period, are constant. Pension bridging benefits are paid along with a pension to top-up that pension, or until the pension entitlement is reached. This top-up may be necessary as the pension that is payable may have been reduced or delayed due to forced early retirement. Pension bridging benefits may also act as an incentive to take early retirement.\nA pension bridging benefit has the following characteristics: \n\nit bridges to future pension entitlement, such as a company pension, CPP/QPP and Old Age Security (OAS)\nthe amount of the bridging benefit is based on a periodic payment\nthe individual who is receiving it has reached retirement age (either early or normal)\nthe amount that is being paid as the pension bridging benefit is approximately at the same level as the additional pension that is to be paid in the future\n\nIf the pension bridging benefits are to be paid out of general company revenues, 3 additional conditions must be met: \n\nthe bridging benefit payment period does not count towards years of service for the company pension that is to be paid\nthe employer's bridging benefit program must be based on the worker meeting a set age, years of service and retirement date requirements, and\nthe bridging benefit payment must not reduce the individual's entitlement to severance payments accumulated from that employment, according to the contract or collective agreement and/or provincial or federal labour standards\n\nPeriodic payments include situations in which employees have a choice of receiving the bridging benefits in a lump sum rather than in monthly instalments. If a lump-sum bridging benefit meets all the other conditions to be considered a pension bridging benefit, then the monthly amount upon which the lump-sum payment was based will be determined and allocated pursuant to EIR 36(14) over the period for which it is payable, in the same manner as monthly pension bridging benefits.\nBecause a pension bridging benefit arises out of employment, is paid at retirement age, and is usually calculated based on the employee's age, years of service and retirement date, it resembles a retirement pension and is treated and allocated as such for EI benefit purposes.\nPension bridging benefits may be paid until pension entitlement is reached, or to supplement a pension or other retirement compensation, such as a pension payment from the employer's Group RRSPs (Digest 5.13.3) and/or Deferred Profit Sharing Plans (DPSPs) (Digest 5.15.3).\nIt is not necessary that a bridging benefit be paid along with a pension to be considered a pension bridging benefit. It is sufficient that it allows the employee to make the transition to a future pension such as a company pension, CPP/QPP or OAS.\nAn example of a pension bridging benefit is the payment of an amount equal to future CPP/QPP and/or OAS entitlement. The pension bridging benefit may be paid alone, or in addition to the basic pension, or some other retirement income already payable to the employee. It is paid until the CPP/QPP pension and/or the OAS commence.\nThe fact that OAS is not pension earnings cannot change the nature of pension bridging benefits that are paid to compensate the employee at a level equivalent to their future OAS (EIR 35(1)). The employer or the pension fund has taken on the obligation of paying an equivalent amount until the actual OAS benefits start, and that equivalent amount becomes a retirement pension. This does not qualify these payments as OAS benefits. OAS does not meet the definition of a retirement pension arising out of employment as it is based solely on age and residence in Canada.\nPension bridging benefits cannot be considered a loan unless, under the terms of the pension bridging benefit plan, there is an obligation on the part of the pensioner, to repay the loan, and documentary evidence supporting that obligation exists (FCA A-1050-90; CUB 15686B).\nA bridging benefit paid out of general company revenue, which does not meet the characteristics listed above, cannot be considered a pension bridging benefit and cannot be treated as a periodic pension. The allocation will depend on whether the claimant remains an employee while these payments are being made, or the employee has separated from that employment, and the payments are part of termination payments (EIR 36(5); EIR 36(9); Digest 5.7.2; Digest 5.12.7).\nPension bridging benefits are no longer considered earnings if the claimant meets the requalifier exemption for pension income (Digest 5.13.13). This is true whether the pension bridging benefits are paid out of the pension fund, or out of general company revenues. As well, when pension bridging benefits are no longer payable, and the claimant starts or continues to receive the company pension, any insurable hours earned while receiving pension bridging benefits, qualify as insurable hours towards meeting the requalifier exemption for the company pension.",0.988981
306,306,306,"The amount of money you receive as part of your pension plan is called the periodic pension. This includes the main pension amount plus any extra payments, deductions, or financial responsibilities where your pension money is used. 

One exception is if your pension was divided due to divorce or if part of your pension was given to your spouse. 

Periodic pensions can change over time. They can increase if they are adjusted for inflation, reviewed periodically, or set up to increase over time. 

They can also decrease if certain benefits stop, other government benefits start, or if the pension is divided or split. 

Regardless of any changes, the amount that counts as income is the actual amount you receive in your pension. 

Pension payments are usually made monthly. If you donâ€™t know the exact amount, an estimate can be used temporarily. 

To figure out the weekly amount of your pension, the monthly amount is multiplied by 12 to get the yearly amount, which is then divided by 52 weeks. If your pension starts on a day other than at the beginning of a week, the amount for that week is adjusted.

This includes the basic pension amount as well as:\n\nany supplement to that pension, including any pension bridging benefits (Digest 5.13.5.2)\nany deductions made for the purpose of buying back previous service, or non-existent service, under the terms of the pension plan, or\nany other financial obligation of the claimant for which their pension is used to satisfy\n\nThe one exception to this occurs where the claimant's pension has been divided due to marital dissolution or due to spousal assignment of a CPP or QPP pension (Digest 5.13.12.1; Digest 5.13.12.2).\nPeriodic pensions are not always the same amount for the life of the employee. Periodic pension payments from a pension fund can increase. Increases may come about when the pension is indexed to the cost of living; when the pension annuity is reviewed periodically and ad hoc increases are given to compensate for the decreased buying power of the pension, or when the pension payment is a variable or escalating life annuity.\nPeriodic pension payments from a pension fund can also decrease. Decreases in periodic pensions may occur when:\n\nbridging benefits from a pension plan cease\nwhen CPP/QPP or OAS payments start where a pension plan is integrated with these benefits, whether through exercising an option or not\nwhen a pension is split due to marital dissolution, or\nCPP/QPP payments are assigned to a spouse\n\nWhether the amount increases or decreases, the amount to be allocated is the amount of pension that is payable. When employment pensions decrease due to bridging benefits or integration with social security benefits, the amount to be allocated from the employment pension will also decrease. However, there may be a corresponding new allocation for the amount of the pension now being paid from another source (CPP or QPP). Should the pension bridging benefit be designed to bridge until OAS entitlement, there would be no corresponding increase in allocation, as OAS is not considered a pension for EI purposes (EIR 35(1)).\nPeriodic pensions resulting from employment are usually paid monthly, towards the end of the month. If the exact amount of the gross pension is not known, an estimate will be used until the exact figure is available.\nIn order to obtain the weekly amount for allocation, monthly periodic pensions are converted to a weekly amount by multiplying the monthly amount by twelve (12) to obtain the yearly figure, then dividing that figure by 52. If the start of the pension begins other than at the beginning of a week, the weekly amount will be pro-rated for the number of working days the pension was payable (that is, one-fifth for each working day).\nPeriodic pensions are allocated to the period for which they are paid or payable (EIR 36(14)). A periodic pension, like a lump-sum pension benefit, is allocated concurrently with any other earnings earned during that period (EIR 36(16)).

The type of pension benefit a person receives depends on whether the pension plan is approved by the government. Normally, pension benefits are paid out as annuities once an employee retires.

A pension benefit is an annual, monthly, or other periodic amount to which an employee is, or will be entitled, upon retirement. This periodic payment is commonly called an annuity. Although the goal of all pension plans is the same, the type of pension benefit payable under a pension plan depends on whether the plan is registered under the Income Tax Act (Digest 5.13.10).\nWhat the pension legislation envisions, and what is reflected in the registered pension plans themselves, is that the pension benefit employees will receive will be in the form of an annuity. In addition, that annuity will be payable only on retirement. However, although the stated intention of pension plans is to pay pension benefits as an annuity, there are some restricted circumstances where the pension plan allows the transfer of accumulated pension credits (locked-in contributions) into a lump-sum payment. This is called a lump-sum pension benefit. Although it is normally paid on termination of employment due to retirement, it may be paid earlier under special unlocking provisions allowed under some pension plans, or as a return of additional voluntary contributions (AVCs) to the claimant (Digest 5.13.6.2; Digest 5.13.9.1). Lump-sum pension benefits are considered payable no matter how the claimant chooses to dispose of them (Digest 5.13.6.3).

309,309,309,"If an employee hasn't reached retirement age yet, it is unlikely they are receiving a lump-sum pension benefit. This type of payment is usually only given at retirement. However, there is one exception to this rule. Some pension plans allow employees to unlock a portion of their locked-in pension credits before retirement. This means that they can receive a part of their pension as a lump-sum payment when they leave their job, even if they are not yet old enough to retire.

When this option is available, the employee can transfer up to 25% of their accumulated locked-in pension credits. The remaining 75% must still be used to purchase a pension annuity. The decision on whether to choose a deferred or immediate annuity depends on the employee's situation and if they have applied for a pension yet.

Even though the partial transfer doesn't specify whether it's employer or employee contributions being returned, it doesn't change the fact that it's considered a lump-sum pension benefit. This payment allows the employee to access a part of their pension as a lump sum instead of waiting for regular pension payments.

It's important to note that a lump-sum pension benefit is different from a simple return of contributions. The key difference lies in the details of the pension plan and when contributions are locked in by the law. Any lump-sum payment made outside of the pension plan's terms and without immediate pension entitlement is likely a payment due to separation or lay-off. These payments are based on the employee's normal weekly earnings from the time of separation.",61.61379562043796,9.527528675703865,11.765960540728903,12.50010427528676,10.410203336809175,10.220583941605838,49.49843587069865,5.857142857142857,0.817828852396745,0.8431556771198908,2.797294106325701,0.5743180825719096,0.435559096948536,0.082214675450293,4.682481751824818,4.0,2.5951779487028297,19.571428571428573,19.0,6.768775851704076,1.4817518248175183,1.0,0.7839837420202951,274,134,0.4890510948905109,1333,14,5.13.6.2,Prior to retirement age,Chapter 5 - Earnings,"If the employee has not reached retirement age (early or normal retirement age), it is highly unlikely that what is being paid is a lump-sum pension benefit. The one exception to the only payable at retirement rule would be if the payment results from special unlocking of previously locked-in pension credits, allowed by some pension plans and under pension legislation.\nThis special provision allows the employee to choose to receive, as partial discharge of their rights under the plan, a transfer of a portion of their locked-in pension credits. If allowed under the employee's pension plan, this option is open to the employee on the termination of employment, even if the employee has not reached normal retirement age. The partial transfer allowed is usually an amount up to 25% of the employee's accumulated locked-in pension credits prior to a date specified in the pension plan, and the applicable pension legislation. Although this provision generally applies to pension credits accumulated prior to a specified date, this may not be the same under all legislation. Whether a date is specified or not, the guidance is the same for any of these types of payments. The employee, on termination, can only access up to 25% of the locked-in contributions in this fashion. The remaining 75% must be used to support the payment of either a deferred or an immediate annuity. Which one, depends on the employee's specific circumstances and whether they have applied for, and are entitled to receive a pension.\nPartial transfer amounts generally do not identify which contributions (employer, employee, or both) are being returned. Nevertheless, even if these amounts are identified as employee contributions, it is not relevant to the determination that these moneys are a lump-sum pension benefit. These moneys are not a return of excess employee contributions as established by the provisions of the pension legislation. They are in reality a portion of the employee's pension that has been unlocked, therefore allowing the employee immediate access to this part of their pension annuity in the form of a lump-sum payment (Digest 5.13.8.1). The total pension amount that the employee will receive will be the same using this option; the only difference is that it includes both a lump-sum pension benefit, and a periodic pension.\nA lump-sum pension benefit can be distinguished from a return of contributions. This distinction is based on the specific terms and wording included in the pension plan documents and the point at which the pension contributions are locked-in by the legislation. For example, a pay out of moneys prior to lock-in is normally a return of contributions, whereas a payout after lock-in is generally a lump-sum pension payment arising out of unlocking pension credits.\nAny other lump-sum payment linked to a retirement or separation, but made outside the terms of the pension plan and without immediate pension entitlement according to the terms of the pension plan, is likely a lump-sum payment made by reason of separation. As they result from a lay-off or separation, these retirement payments are allocated from the week of the lay-off or separation, at normal weekly earnings (EIR 36(9); Digest 5.12.7).",0.99887663

311,311,311,"Lump-sum pension benefits are unique because they are meant to replace regular pension payments. If these benefits were based on weekly earnings, it would not accurately ensure lifelong coverage like a typical pension would. That's why lump-sum pension benefits are converted into an equivalent weekly payment that mimics what a regular pension would provide.

To calculate this equivalence, a table is used, which is updated yearly. The table shows different weekly amounts based on a person's age at the time of receiving the lump sum. For example, someone who is 56 years old when they get a $30,000 lump sum would receive a weekly amount of $30.30 ($30,000 divided by 1000, then multiplied by $1.01).

These calculations only apply to true pension lump sums, not other types of lump-sum earnings. To decide if a sum qualifies as a lump-sum pension benefit, the rules of the pension plan and laws related to pensions need to be checked.

Lump-sum pension payments are considered alongside other earnings received during the same period and do not prevent interruptions in earnings.

As such, lump-sum pension benefits are converted to the equivalent of what these payments would have been, had they been paid as an annuity (EIR 36(15); EIR 36(17)).\nThe table below, which is updated annually, is used to perform this calculation.\n\nTable: Weekly annuity equivalents for a lump sum of $1,000 according to age of claimant\n\nWeekly annuity equivalents for a lump sum of $1,000 according to age of claimant\n\n\nLump-sum pension benefit paid or payable from December 31, 2023 to  December 28, 2024\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(week code 2428 to 2479)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCalculated pursuant to subsection 36(17) of the EIR\nLump-sum pension benefit paid or payable from January 1, 2023 to December  30, 2023\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(week code 2376 to 2427) Calculated pursuant to subsection 36(17) of the EIR\nLump-sum pension benefit paid or payable from December 26, 2021 to December 31, 2022\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(week code 2323 to 2375)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCalculated pursuant to subsection 36(17) of the EIR\n\n\n\n\nAge of claimant\nWeekly annuity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tequivalent\nAge of claimant\nWeekly annuity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tequivalent\nAge of claimant\nWeekly annuity\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tequivalent\n\n\n19 and under\n0.70\n19 and under\n0.58\n19 and under\n0.47\n\n\n20\n0.70\n20\n0.58\n20\n0.47\n\n\n21\n0.70\n21\n0.58\n21\n0.47\n\n\n22\n0.71\n22\n0.59\n22\n0.48\n\n\n23\n0.71\n23\n0.60\n23\n0.48\n\n\n24\n0.71\n24\n0.60\n24\n0.49\n\n\n25\n0.72\n25\n0.60\n25\n0.49\n\n\n26\n0.72\n26\n0.60\n26\n0.50\n\n\n27\n0.73\n27\n0.61\n27\n0.50\n\n\n28\n0.73\n28\n0.61\n28\n0.51\n\n\n29\n0.74\n29\n0.62\n29\n0.51\n\n\n30\n0.74\n30\n0.62\n30\n0.52\n\n\n31\n0.75\n31\n0.63\n31\n0.52\n\n\n32\n0.75\n32\n0.64\n32\n0.53\n\n\n33\n0.76\n33\n0.64\n33\n0.54\n\n\n34\n0.76\n34\n0.65\n34\n0.54\n\n\n35\n0.77\n35\n0.66\n35\n0.55\n\n\n36\n0.78\n36\n0.66\n36\n0.56\n\n\n37\n0.78\n37\n0.67\n37\n0.57\n\n\n38\n0.79\n38\n0.68\n38\n0.57\n\n\n39\n0.80\n39\n0.69\n39\n0.58\n\n\n40\n0.81\n40\n0.69\n40\n0.59\n\n\n41\n0.81\n41\n0.70\n41\n0.60\n\n\n42\n0.82\n42\n0.71\n42\n0.61\n\n\n43\n0.83\n43\n0.72\n43\n0.62\n\n\n44\n0.84\n44\n0.73\n44\n0.63\n\n\n45\n0.85\n45\n0.74\n45\n0.64\n\n\n46\n0.86\n46\n0.75\n46\n0.65\n\n\n47\n0.87\n47\n0.76\n47\n0.66\n\n\n48\n0.89\n48\n0.78\n48\n0.68\n\n\n49\n0.90\n49\n0.79\n49\n0.69\n\n\n50\n0.91\n50\n0.80\n50\n0.70\n\n\n51\n0.93\n51\n0.82\n51\n0.72\n\n\n52\n0.94\n52\n0.83\n52\n0.73\n\n\n53\n0.96\n53\n0.85\n53\n0.75\n\n\n54\n0.97\n54\n0.86\n54\n0.77\n\n\n55\n0.99\n55\n0.88\n55\n0.78\n\n\n56\n1.01\n56\n0.90\n56\n0.80\n\n\n57\n1.03\n57\n0.92\n57\n0.82\n\n\n58\n1.05\n58\n0.94\n58\n0.84\n\n\n59\n1.07\n59\n0.96\n59\n0.87\n\n\n60\n1.10\n60\n0.99\n60\n0.89\n\n\n61\n1.12\n61\n1.01\n61\n0.91\n\n\n62\n1.15\n62\n1.04\n62\n0.94\n\n\n63\n1.18\n63\n1.07\n63\n0.97\n\n\n64\n1.21\n64\n1.10\n64\n1.00\n\n\n65\n1.24\n65\n1.13\n65\n1.03\n\n\n66\n1.28\n66\n1.17\n66\n1.07\n\n\n67\n1.32\n67\n1.20\n67\n1.11\n\n\n68\n1.36\n68\n1.24\n68\n1.15\n\n\n69\n1.40.\n69\n1.29\n69\n1.19\n\n\n70\n1.45\n70\n1.33\n70\n1.23\n\n\n71\n1.50\n71\n1.38\n71\n1.28\n\n\n72\n1.55\n72\n1.43\n72\n1.34\n\n\n73\n1.61\n73\n1.49\n73\n1.40\n\n\n74\n1.68\n74\n1.56\n74\n1.46\n\n\n75\n1.74\n75\n1.62\n75\n1.53\n\n\n76\n1.82\n76\n1.70\n76\n1.60\n\n\n77\n1.90\n77\n1.78\n77\n1.68\n\n\n78\n1.99\n78\n1.86\n78\n1.77\n\n\n79\n2.09\n79\n1.96\n79\n1.86\n\n\n80\n2.19\n80\n2.06\n80\n1.97\n\n\n81\n2.31\n81\n2.18\n81\n2.08\n\n\n82\n2.43\n82\n2.30\n82\n2.21\n\n\n83\n2.57\n83\n2.44\n83\n2.35\n\n\n84\n2.73\n84\n2.59\n84\n2.50\n\n\n85\n2.90\n85\n2.76\n85\n2.67\n\n\n86\n3.09\n86\n2.95\n86\n2.86\n\n\n87\n3.30\n87\n3.17\n87\n3.07\n\n\n88\n3.54\n88\n3.40\n88\n3.31\n\n\n89\n3.79\n89\n3.66\n89\n3.58\n\n\n90 and over\n4.08\n90 and over\n3.96\n90 and over\n3.87\n\n\n\n\nThe table shows the annuity equivalent amount for each $1000 of lump-sum payment made. The claimant's age at the time of the lump-sum payment determines the annuity equivalent amount to be used in the calculation. The lump-sum amount is divided by 1000, and the resulting figure is multiplied by the annuity equivalent amount.\nFor example: A $30,000 lump-sum pension payment paid July 9, 2024, to a claimant who was 56 years of age would be allocated at an amount of $30.30 (30,000/1000 = 30 x $1.01) per week. The impact on this claim is vastly different than if this amount was allocated at a normal weekly earnings rate of $600.00 for 50 weeks.\nDue to the vast difference in the outcome between an allocation as a lump-sum pension benefit and other types of lump-sum earnings, only amounts that are truly a lump-sum pension benefit are treated in this manner. To determine whether an amount is a lump-sum pension benefit, the provisions of the pension plan and the applicable pension legislation must be examined.\nLump-sum pension amounts are allocated concurrently with any other earnings paid or payable during that period (EIR 36(16) ). In addition, lump-sum pension payments do not prevent an interruption of earnings (EIR 35(5)).\nFor registered pension plans, a lump-sum pension benefit includes only those sums paid or payable from locked-in pension credits, which are due to the claimant as a retiree under the terms and conditions of that plan, or, under the provisions of the plan or pension legislation that allows access to these locked-in moneys.",0.96095735
312,312,312,"Due to changes in jobs, employees may not stay with one employer for their whole career. If someone works for a short time at a job and doesn't have their pension contributions locked in, they can get back all the money they put into the pension plan. But once the money is locked in, it can't be refunded according to the plan's rules.

When an employee's job ends, they can move their locked-in pension credits to another financial option to eventually receive a pension. This ability to move pension credits is called portability. But regular pension plan contributions can't be moved this way because they're not considered locked-in according to pension laws.

The pension credits can only be moved directly from the pension fund to specific approved options and must stay locked in until retirement age is reached. The approved options include moving the money to another employer's pension plan, a locked-in RRSP, or similar accounts like a LIRA or CRI in Quebec, or an annuity purchase contract.

Sometimes it's not possible to transfer contributions between plans depending on the rules of the plans involved. If the pension credits are moved directly from one locked-in option to another, it's considered that no money was given to the person, and the funds can only be accessed at retirement age.

At age 71, money in a locked-in RRSP must be used to buy an annuity, and once the pension payments start, they may affect EI benefits.",65.11687747035576,9.890671936758896,11.741389052700956,13.152569169960476,11.55355731225297,9.733280632411066,49.086956521739125,6.0,0.8780682265758515,0.85629669825236,2.8592022001619526,0.5966161521620186,0.4318470866651981,0.0784931929524545,4.561264822134388,4.0,2.4658140068607164,23.0,22.0,7.603826787755086,1.3992094861660078,1.0,0.7076092407102038,253,121,0.4782608695652174,1204,11,5.13.7,Portability of locked-in pension credits,Chapter 5 - Earnings,"Due to the mobility that occurs within the labour force, an employee may not spend their entire career with just one employer. The employee is protected in that, if the employment was only for a short time and lock-in has not occurred, they can receive a return of all the contributions made to the pension plan. However, no refund can be made once pension contributions are locked into the pension fund under the terms of the plan.\nRecognizing the need to be able to move locked-in pension contributions, pension legislation requires that pension plans under its jurisdiction, allow for the transfer of pension credits (locked-in pension contributions and the accumulated interest) when employment ends. This ability to transfer pension credits to another financial vehicle, where they will ultimately be used to pay a pension, is called portability. Non-registered pension plan contributions cannot be transferred in this manner as they are not considered to be locked-in pension credits under pension legislation (Digest 5.13.10).\nThe condition on the transfer of accumulated pension credits is that they must move directly from the pension fund into one of the locked-in vehicles approved by the pension legislation for this purpose. In addition, these moneys must remain locked in until retirement age is reached.\nThe acceptable locked-in vehicles are the following:\n\nanother employer's pension plan, if the other plan permits this transfer of pension credits\na locked-in, non-commutable RRSP; or some other similar vehicle, such as a provincial Locked-in Retirement Account (LIRA), or a Compte de Retraite ImmobilisÃƒÂ© (CRI) in the province of Quebec, which have all the same provisions as a locked-in, non-commutable RRSP (Digest 5.13.2), and\nan annuity purchase contract\n\nSometimes, due to the types of pension plans involved and the various benefits these plans provide, transfer of contributions from one plan to another is not possible. The plan, to which the pension credits are to be transferred, must permit this transfer.\nIf pension credits are transferred directly from one locked-in vehicle to another on termination of employment, it is considered that nothing was paid or payable to the claimant. Moreover, these pension credits can only be accessed at retirement age, according to the specified provisions of each locked-in vehicle. Therefore it is only at that time that any legal entitlement to an immediate payment exists. Claimants who arrange for the transfer of their pension credits in this manner will not have any earnings allocated from these vehicles until they are paid out under the terms of the locked-in vehicle.\nAt age 71, any moneys in a locked-in RRSP must be used to purchase an annuity.

Any contributions and interest that are not locked in, and that you have a right to according to the plan, will be paid to you when you leave your job.

These contributions can be based on either a fixed amount, or a percentage of salary. These contributions are made by way of payroll deductions, and form part of the employee's gross earnings from employment during each pay period.\nAll pension plans recognize that employees have a vested right to their own contributions. As a result, on termination, employees are entitled to receive a refund of all their own employee contributions that were not locked-in.\nHowever, it is not only employees who have been employed for a short period of time with an employer, who may receive a return of their employee contributions. There are times when an employee may receive a refund of employee contributions, even after lock-in has occurred. Pension legislation for defined benefit pension plans may require that no employee's contributions, including any accumulated interest, can be more than 50% of the commuted value of the pension. This type of refund is simply a return of the contributions that have been determined to be in excess of the amounts an employee is required to contribute, pursuant to pension legislation. This requirement is referred to by a number of terms: maximum funding by employee contributions, minimum employer cost, defined benefit, or maximum cost provision. When the employment is terminated, an actuary who reviews the employee's pension credits will determine whether there has been an excess of employee contributions. These excess employee contributions must be returned to the employee, according to the terms of the pension legislation.\nIn all cases where employee contributions are returned to the employee on termination, they are earnings arising out of employment (EIR 35(2)). That being said, these earnings formed part of the employee's gross weekly earnings during employment, and would have been considered earnings at that time, and not at the time of termination (EIR 36(4) & (5)). As a result, this return of employee contributions on termination of employment has no effect on any current benefit period.",0.9789884
315,315,315,"Employers contribute to pension funds when employees are working. Employers can put money into a pension fund in different ways, like matching what employees contribute, giving a set amount for each employee, or using a percentage of an employee's earnings or the company's profits. Employer contributions are separate from what employees receive as wages, and they are not used to calculate income taxes or other deductions when employees are paid.

In most pension plans, employees become entitled to their employer's contributions at the same time as they become locked in. This means that if an employee leaves the job, they won't receive the employer contributions unless they are vested but not locked in. Some pension plans allow employees to have rights to employer contributions that are not locked in, meaning they can get a refund. These kinds of contributions are treated as regular earnings and need to be paid out if the employee's job ends, even if they put the money into a special retirement account.

Some pension plans don't allow employees to receive employer contributions if they leave before retirement. In cases like business closures or bankruptcies, employees might get their employer contributions, but these are not considered part of their pension plan benefits. These types of payments are seen more as regular termination payments rather than retirement benefits.",50.16145945945948,11.777909909909912,14.836745963215662,16.44756756756757,13.920135135135132,13.140720720720717,52.83063063063062,6.8,0.8467254704899259,0.8550670072436333,3.0169742066824283,0.6271520453751648,0.4342865431130974,0.0509306106249109,5.148648648648648,4.0,2.834865453211755,22.2,22.5,7.547184905645283,1.5855855855855856,1.0,0.8747557545180797,222,111,0.5,1177,10,5.13.8.2,Return of employer contributions,Chapter 5 - Earnings,"Employer contributions to the pension fund are made during the periods of employment. These contributions can be directed into a pension fund based on: \n\na matching of employee contributions\na fixed amount per employee\na percentage of the employee's earnings, or\na percentage of the employer's profits for a certain period\n\nThe very nature of employer contributions makes them different from those of the employees. Employer contributions do not form part of the employee's gross wages, and are not used in the calculation of the employee's income tax deductions, CPP contributions or EI premiums at the time the employee is paid.\nIn all present pension legislation, vesting occurs at the same time as lock-in. If vesting and lock-in do occur at the same time, there will be no payment of the employer contributions on termination. However, pension legislation only sets out the minimum requirements that plans must follow, and individual plans may set vesting at an earlier date than lock-in. If an employee is entitled to receive any employer contributions on termination, it will be because the employer contributions are vested, but not locked-in.\n\n\nVested right to the employer's contributions according to the terms of the plan\nSome pension plans contain provisions that give employees vested rights to the employer contributions that are not locked-in. These moneys are fully refundable because they are not locked-in under the pension plan. If they were locked-in, the claimant would not have access to them. Employer contributions that are not locked-in cannot have the character of an amount on account of, or in lieu of a pension, as the employee is not of retirement age and is not entitled to a pension benefit. They are solely a return of contributions. Although they are not considered as pension earnings, these moneys are earnings as they fall under the entire income arising out of any employment (EIR 35(2)). Once these moneys are identified as earnings, it must be determined how they are to be allocated. These earnings are paid out of the pension fund because the employee's employment ended, which gives them the characteristics of a retirement benefit. As the reason these earnings were paid is because of a lay-off or separation, they must be allocated as a termination payment, at normal weekly earnings, starting from the week of lay-off or separation (EIR 36(9); Digest 5.12.7). These earnings are considered payable and must be allocated, even if the claimant places them into a locked-in non-commutable RRSP. Only locked-in pension credits can benefit from transfer to a locked-in vehicle, and avoid being considered payable; the return of employer contributions cannot be considered as such.\n\n\nNo vested right to employer's contributions according to the terms of the plan\nSome pension plans have no provision for the vesting of employer contributions when employment is terminated prior to retirement age. Termination of employment due to business closures or bankruptcies, and any resultant pension plan wind-up, can result in the payment of employer contributions to workers, who are not covered under the provisions of the pension plan. If these moneys are given to the workers, they cannot be considered a pension benefit under the terms of the plan, as there is no right to such a benefit (only a deferred annuity or death benefit may be allowed by the plan). They also cannot be considered a return of contributions under the pension plan, as there is no such provision within the plan. Therefore, these moneys, which have not been locked-in, are considered to be paid by virtue of provincial legislation or through the employer's gratuitous gesture, due to the closure of the company. These payments are made by reason of the termination of employment and the resultant wrap-up of the pension plan. Their true nature is a type of termination payment and not a pension benefit.  As such, they would be allocated at normal weekly earnings starting from the week of lay-off or separation, as are all payments made by reason of a lay-off or separation (EIR 36(9); Digest 5.12.7; Digest 5.12.4).",0.9980447
316,316,316,"Pension plans can be divided into two types: contributory and non-contributory. A non-contributory plan means the employer pays for the whole pension benefit without requiring the employee to contribute any money. In a contributory plan, the employee must contribute money towards their pension, and the employer covers the rest of the cost.

All pension plans explain who needs to contribute money, whether it's the employees, the employer, or both. Some pension plans offer ways for employees to increase their pension amount when they retire. This can be done by making extra contributions, buying back years of service when no contributions were made, or purchasing extra years of service even if they weren't worked.

When these extra contributions are paid out as pension benefits, whether as regular payments or a one-time sum, they are handled differently based on whether they were voluntary (AVCs) or required (ARCs) contributions to the pension fund.",52.82064516129034,11.392811059907835,13.925175675911133,15.308755760368664,13.495299539170505,12.642580645161289,51.82027649769585,6.571428571428571,0.8612705568472544,0.8214670300483704,2.941811483486675,0.5858838645977914,0.4184480353406185,0.0248890884106274,5.064516129032258,4.0,2.7955665808212067,22.142857142857142,21.0,8.407965125464091,1.5548387096774194,1.0,0.8809227968360405,155,90,0.5806451612903226,814,7,5.13.9,Additional contributions to a pension fund,Chapter 5 - Earnings,"Pension plans can be contributory or non-contributory. Whether a plan is contributory depends on whether the employee is required to make contributions. In a non-contributory plan, the employer contributes the entire cost of the pension benefit. The employee in these plans is not  required to contribute anything. A contributory plan, on the other hand, is a plan where the employees are required to contribute towards their pensions, and the employer pays the balance of the costs.\nAll pension plans set out what is required in contributions, whether by their members and the employer, or the employer alone. Some pension plans allow their employees to increase their pension amounts on retirement by making additional pension contributions on a voluntary basis, buying back past service where no contributions had been made, or purchasing additional years of service, whether or not those years have been worked.\nWhen these pension benefits, funded through additional contributions to the pension fund, are paid out, either through receipt of an annuity or in a lump sum, they are handled differently depending on whether they were additional voluntary contributions (AVCs) or additional required contributions (ARCs) to the pension fund.",0.99618596

These extra contributions are commonly known as additional voluntary contributions (AVCs). There is a limit on the extent of the AVCs that an employee can make into the pension plan. AVCs have no direct effect on the employer's pension costs. The employer is not required to match these AVCs, as the employer may do with the required contributions an employee pays into the pension fund.\nAn employee may choose to put AVCs into their pension fund for a number of reasons. The investment rate offered by the pension fund may be higher than the individual could obtain if they invested with another institution. It may be chosen for the ease in investment, as contributions are made through payroll deductions and saving is thus ensured. Whatever the employee's reasons for choosing to place AVCs into the pension fund, the fact remains that the individual could have made that same investment elsewhere. They had that option, as these AVCs are not required of the employee, by their pension plan.\nAVCs are tax deductible and count towards the pension adjustment amount for income tax purposes. They, therefore, reduce the amounts available for contribution into a personal RRSP in a particular tax year.\nAVCs, once made, are accounted for separately from the employee's required contributions. They are never combined with the required contributions in the fund. They must remain separate, or they lose their characterization as AVCs. When employees receive a summary of their contributions in the fund, they will receive a report on the status of 2 separate amounts, their required contribution accumulation, as well as their AVCs.\nAlthough not locked-in under pension legislation, once made, AVCs must remain in the pension plan during the entire period of employment. The employee cannot access them while still employed. There is one exception to this rule and it occurs if the pension plan is subsequently amended so that it no longer has the provision allowing AVCs. In that case, all employees who had AVCs accumulated in the plan up until that date would be able to roll them over into a RRSP on a one-time basis.\nOn termination of employment due to retirement, AVCs are an exception allowed to the rule regarding pension contributions, under the Income Tax Act. Although AVCs cannot be withdrawn until the termination of employment, they can be paid on termination as a lump-sum payment, should the employee choose to receive them in that form, rather than as an annuity for life.\nLump-sum payments of AVCs and portions of annuities derived solely from AVCs are not earnings for EI benefit purposes. AVCs are more like a purchase of a private pension plan than a required contribution to the pension plan. Pensions arising from private pension plans are not  earnings for EI purposes. They do not meet the definition of a pension, according to the Regulations, as they do not arise out of employment. Despite the fact that the moneys used for the contributions were earned during employment, the contributions were entirely voluntary and could have potentially been invested anywhere. This excludes them as a pension under the definition in EIR 35(1).

Employees can buy back years of past service with their current or previous employers by making the necessary contributions. The extra payments can be made in a lump sum, installments, or deducted from future pension payments. Once the contributions are made, they become part of the pension fund and cannot be distinguished from regular contributions.

In some cases, employees can even purchase fictional years of service to meet retirement criteria. They would need to pay both the employer's and their own share of these extra contributions.

Depending on the provisions of the particular pension plan, this may apply to years of past service with the present employer, or other previous employers. Once the employee decides to do this, the additional contributions now required to support those additional years of service are calculated and these moneys must be paid into the pension fund. Depending on the provision of the pension plan, this may be done through the payment of a lump-sum amount, by installments, or as a deduction from the periodic pension to which the employee has or will become entitled. These payments, once made, become part of the pension fund; meaning they are not accounted for separately and can no longer be differentiated from any other required locked-in contribution under the pension plan.\nSome pension plans allow an employee to purchase years of non-existent service in order to meet retirement requirements. The employee may be responsible for both the employer's and the employee's portion of the contributions in these pension buy-back situations.

The payment arrangements may be the same as in the case of buying back previous service.\nPurchasing years of service, whether they were previously worked or not, cannot be considered an AVC. Although deciding to make the purchase may be voluntary, once that decision is made, these contributions are then required under the plan, and must be made in order to increase the employee's pension to the level desired.

To still get these benefits, a separate non-registered plan can be made. The payments from this plan are treated the same as ones from a registered plan.

Usually, money from a non-registered plan is paid either as a lump-sum, periodic payments, or a return of contributions. The type of payments depends on when a person retires. The retirement ages and payment rules are similar in the registered and non-registered plans. When a person retires, they get money from both plans based on a set formula.

If a person leaves their job before retirement, they can leave their pension money in both plans until retirement. The money isn't given out until the person decides. If someone leaves their job, they might get the value of their non-registered plan early. This money is treated the same way as other job-related payments.

If an employer makes a commitment to pay pension benefits in excess of this maximum, the excess benefits cannot be included in the registered pension plan. If these excess benefits were to remain in the pension plan, the entire pension plan would no longer meet the criteria for registration under the Income Tax Act. In order to avoid this, the employer may create a non-registered pension plan just to pay these excess benefits. These benefits are then paid out of general company revenues and not out of the registered pension fund.\nThe key to handling any payments made under a non-registered pension plan is to determine the true nature of the payment. These payments are then treated in the same manner as any similar payment out of a registered pension plan.\nGenerally, payments from a non-registered pension plan are either a lump-sum pension benefit, a periodic pension, or a return of contributions. The nature of these payments depends on whether or not an individual is eligible for retirement. The applicable early and normal retirement ages are set out in the provisions of the non-registered pension plan. These ages are generally the same as those in the registered pension plan, as they are designed to supplement the registered pension amounts.\nWhen an individual reaches retirement age, either early or normal, the employee's pension is calculated using all components, based on the formula developed by the company for this purpose. Any pension payable from the registered pension plan is supplemented by either an additional periodic pension, or a lump-sum pension benefit paid out of the non-registered pension plan. However, the non-registered pension may be paid separately. Regardless of the fact that this pension is paid by the company, and is not paid out of a registered pension plan, these moneys still meet the definition of a retirement pension arising out of employment (EIR 35(1)). The allocation will be the same as for any pension; that is, periodic pensions are allocated to the period for which the pension is paid or payable and lump-sum pension benefits are converted to an annuity and allocated from the week paid or payable (Digest 5.13.5.3; Digest 5.13.6.4). Should the employee defer the receipt of the registered portion, the non-registered portion, or both portions, allocation only occurs when the pension becomes payable (Digest 5.13.4).\nIf an individual leaves employment prior to retirement age, the plan may allow the employee to leave all pension entitlement in the pension plans (both registered and non-registered) until retirement age is reached. This is treated in the same way as any deferred pension entitlement. The allocation does not start until the employee elects to receive their pension as it is only then that the pensions are considered payable (Digest 5.13.4).\nOn termination of employment prior to retirement age, a claimant may receive the commuted value of their non-registered pension entitlement. These moneys are earnings and are allocated in the same manner as any other payment made by reason of a lay-off or separation, and the same way as a return of employer contributions (Digest 5.13.8.2).

322,322,322,"In a defined contribution pension plan, the yearly amount of money put into the pension fund is already decided, and it aims to grow a sum of money for retirement. The pension you receive when you retire is determined by the total contributions and interest gathered over time. There can't be extra money left in this type of system because the retirement pay is based on the total contributions in the fund.

In a defined benefit plan, experts need to figure out how much money needs to be added to the plan each year so there will be enough to pay the guaranteed benefits. This can be tricky because they have to consider things like expected future salaries, how long people are expected to live, how much money investments will make in interest, and other factors. If their estimates are off and there's more money in the fund than needed, it's called a surplus. Surpluses belong to the pension fund as a whole, not individual workers.

Pension laws say that the people in charge of the pension fund have to provide yearly reports checking if they've put in all the needed money. Every so often, a detailed report is required to understand if there is more money than needed (a surplus) or not enough money (a deficit).

When there is extra money in the pension fund, what happens to it depends on the pension plan rules. Usually, if a surplus exists, it goes back to the employer who is often responsible for making sure there's enough money in the fund. Even though employers typically get any excess money, there might be exceptions.

If there is unused money found in a pension fund, it can be handed back to the employer or used in different ways like giving a break from making contributions. The decisions about what to do with extra money are usually made together by everyone who contributed to the fund.

How the unused money is divided could affect your ability to apply for employment insurance benefits. If the surplus is handed back directly to the employer, it shouldn't impact your benefits unless the employer decides to share it with employees. If the extra money is used to give better benefits or a break from contributing, it can modify how past financial contributions are viewed.

Surplus funds could change how a pension plan works, like switching from employees and employers contributing equally to only the employer contributing. This change won't impact benefits but could affect your take-home pay as you won't need to put in money for a set period.

In a nutshell, a surplus in a pension fund is extra money that wasn't needed, and how it's handled could alter how your pension works but probably won't directly impact your employment insurance benefits.",65.67803012684992,9.973880549682878,11.792908689023552,13.350063424947146,11.883752642706128,9.775137420718814,45.00306553911205,5.05,0.8690387543879057,0.8743430508507622,2.728475666206463,0.4379667893694223,0.452899510805257,0.058359159769216,4.562367864693446,4.0,2.4685806400244403,23.65,24.5,6.018928476066151,1.3847780126849891,1.0,0.7122759307049409,473,194,0.4101479915433403,2231,20,5.13.11.1,Pension fund surplus,Chapter 5 - Earnings,"In a defined contribution pension plan, the yearly contribution level is set out in the pension plan and is designed to accumulate a reasonable amount in the pension fund. The pension that a plan member will receive on retirement is the amount of annuity the accumulated contributions and interest will purchase. Defined contribution pension plans can have no surplus as the pension to be paid is based on the amount of accumulated contributions in the fund at retirement age.\nIn a defined benefit pension plan, actuaries must estimate how much must be contributed to the plan each year, in order to accumulate an amount sufficient to support the level of benefits promised in the pension plan. This is not an easy task. In estimating yearly levels of contributions for the final average and career average pension plans, the actuary must factor in anticipated future salary levels, longevity, rate of return on the moneys invested, or other assumptions. Higher than expected return on investments, or setting the contribution rate too high, can result in a greater amount in the fund than is required to support all the present and anticipated commitments of the pension fund. This is called a pension plan surplus. The surplus exists in the pension fund itself, and not in each individual employee's accumulated pension credits.\nAs defined benefit pension plans are based on estimates of the amounts needed to be able to pay a future benefit, these plans can have a surplus (for example, a gain) or a deficit (for example, a deficiency). Pension legislation requires the administrator of the pension plan to file an actuarial report annually, certifying that all contributions for that fiscal year have been made. In addition, at specified intervals, a more detailed report is required on the status of the fund, and whether there are any surpluses or deficiencies.\nWhat happens when there is a surplus will depend on who ultimately owns the surplus, according to the provisions of the pension plan. These provisions include any subsequent amendments made to that plan. The surplus will revert to the employer if there is such a provision in the pension plan. Generally, it is the employer who is responsible for making up any shortfalls in pension funding in defined benefit plans. As a result, it is often the employer who benefits by receiving the surplus, should there be one in the fund. However, this may not always be the case.\nA surplus in a pension fund may be discovered when the periodic reports of the plan's status are prepared. It may also be discovered on wind-up of the pension plan if a business closes or the plan terminates. Regardless of how it is discovered, CRA has very specific rules as to whether any identified surplus can be used, and how it can be used. The surplus may be refunded directly to the employer; may be used to provide a contribution holiday (that is, a period of no contributions) for the employer, the employee, or both; or may be used to increase benefits under the plan.\nThe way in which a surplus will be used is often a joint decision of the parties who contribute to the fund, even for pension funds where the employer has ownership of the surplus. In plans where employees make contributions to the pension fund, decisions on what the employer will do with the surplus may be influenced by the employee's representatives.\nWhatever happens with the surplus, the implications for EI benefits will depend on the way that these moneys are distributed to the employee: that is, based on the true nature of these moneys. Due to the limited options open to the employer, a surplus can only be distributed in certain ways. The fact that these moneys may have resulted from a surplus will not change the character of what they represent.\nIf the choice is to have the surplus refunded to the employer in cash, there will be no implication for a claimant's EI benefits, unless the employer chooses to pass the benefits of the surplus on to the employees. Since  the surplus is the employer's, the means used to pass on the surplus will have to be examined. If it is simply given to the employees, it will be handled in the same manner as all gratuitous payments, and will depend on whether the payment is by reason of a lay-off or separation (EIR 36(9); Digest 5.12.2; Digest 5.12.4). If the employer uses the money to satisfy any of their other obligations, such as paying wages in lieu of notice or severance pay , it will be treated as such (Digest 5.12.5; Digest 5.12.6).\nIf a surplus is identified and the choice is made to use that surplus to increase benefits under the pension plan, it will be allocated according to the nature of the payment. If it increases the amount of a periodic or a lump-sum pension, it is allocated in the same fashion as these pensions (Digest 5.13.5; Digest 5.13.6). If it increases the amount of accumulated pension credits, these credits are treated in the same manner as any other pension credits (Digest 5.13.7). If it is refunded to employees on termination, as part of the employer or employee contributions, it is treated as such (Digest 5.13.8).\nIf the choice is to use the surplus to provide a contribution holiday to the employee, the only implication for EI benefits is if the contribution holiday changes the nature of past contributions made. Although a rare occurrence, the nature of past contributions may be altered by the utilization of a surplus to provide a contribution holiday for plan members. A surplus may be used to make a contributory plan (employee and employer contribute) into a non-contributory one (only employer  contributes) for a portion of the years of past service. In these situations, the surplus funds replace contributions already made by plan members, for a specific period of their past pensionable service. Those years of pensionable service, which were funded by the employee's required contributions, are now funded by the surplus funds. The employee contributions that were previously required now become AVCs. If this occurs, when these newly created AVCs come out of the fund, they will be treated in the same way as all other AVCs (Digest 5.13.9).\nContribution holidays for employees, whether for present or future contributions, will not have any impact, as it is only a pause in the requirement to make contributions. Furthermore, as their regular contributions are made out of the employees' gross earnings, the only benefit of the contribution holiday is to increase the employees' net pay.\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tDistribution of pension fund surplus\r\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nPension fund surplus use:\nMethod\nAllocation\n\n\n\n\nRefunded to employer\npassed gratuitously to the employees\nallocation will depend on whether the payment was made by reason of the lay-off or separation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRegulation 36(9); or 36(19)\n\n\nused to fulfil other financial obligations of the employer in regards to separation\nallocate depending on what type of payment the employer is making\n\n\nTo increase benefits of the pension plan\nincreased pension\nallocate as a pension\n\n\nIncreased amount of contributions returned to the employee on separation\nallocate as a return of either employer or employee contributions depending on how identified\n\n\nincreased amount of pension credits in the fund\nnot considered as payable if transferred to a locked-in vehicle or left in the fund\n\n\nTo provide a contribution holiday\nreplaced past required contributions with the surplus and these past contributions become AVCs\nif pension portion attributable to the AVC can be clearly identified-not earnings\n\n\nif AVCs returned to the claimant in a lump sum-not earnings",0.9717244
323,323,323,"Under the Income Tax Act, there are limits on the maximum pension benefits that a pension plan can provide. An employer cannot have a pension plan that promises benefits above these limits. If an employer wants to give benefits above these limits, they have to pay them separately from the pension plan, or the plan may become unregistered. When a pension plan is unregistered, the contributions made to it are not tax-deductible. 

In addition to the limits on pension benefits, the total contributions and interest kept in the plan for an employee cannot go over a certain amount. The law says that if there are excess contributions, they must be returned to the contributor, which will result in a decrease in the pension benefit.

The calculation to see if an employee has gone over the benefit limit happens when they leave the job and choose to move their locked-in pension credits out of the plan. This calculation only applies to employees with locked-in contributions. Other employees will simply get their contributions back.

Employees with locked-in contributions have a right to a pension when they retire. But the final pension amount depends on all contributions made, the length of service, and the interest earned. If an employee moves their pension credits out of the plan upon leaving, any excess above the maximum allowed by the Canada Revenue Agency will be taxed.

The excess may need to be refunded to the employee according to pension laws. If the excess is not locked-in anymore and is refunded to the employee, it is considered a lump-sum pension benefit for the purpose of Employment Insurance. The excess might need to stay in a locked-in fund or the employer's pension plan to be used for an annuity. If the excess is still locked-in, it cannot be used until the annuity is paid out.",63.44911878881989,9.409060559006214,12.494345625449444,13.391614906832295,10.149301242236024,9.59093167701863,43.41692546583851,4.6875,0.8607133189837138,0.8613740503787994,2.73254271502158,0.4953156366055393,0.4410591653290172,0.0543957122435408,4.568322981366459,4.0,2.604938510027569,20.125,18.5,6.909006802717739,1.453416149068323,1.0,0.7994587498166883,322,130,0.4037267080745341,1509,16,5.13.11.2,Pension fund contributions in excess of CRA limitations,Chapter 5 - Earnings,"Under the Income Tax Act, there is a restriction on the maximum level of pension benefits that a defined benefit pension plan, or a combination pension plan may provide. An employer cannot register a pension plan that contains provisions for benefits to be paid in excess of these maximums. If an employer wishes to provide benefits in excess of these amounts, the employer will have to pay them outside the terms of the pension plan, or have their plan un-registered (Digest 5.13.10). Non-registration of a pension plan means that any contributions made to that plan are not eligible as a deduction for the purposes of income tax.\nIn addition to the pension plan's provisions regarding the anticipated level of pension benefits, the accumulated contributions and interest in the plan for a specific employee cannot generate a pension benefit that exceeds the maximum limit. The regulations under the Income Tax Act require that all pension plans include a provision allowing for the return of excess employer and employee contributions, to the contributor. As a result, there will be a subsequent reduction of accrued pension benefit.\nThe calculation of whether a specific employee has exceeded the maximum level of benefits is done on termination of employment, if the employee chooses to transfer locked-in pension credits out of the pension plan. The calculation to determine if there are any excess contributions only applies to employees whose contributions are locked-in. In all other instances, employees simply receive a return of contributions.\nEmployees whose contributions are locked-in have acquired a right to a pension on retirement. However, it is only after all the contributions are made, the length of the pensionable service is known, and interest on the contributions has accumulated, that the final pension benefit can be calculated. If the employee elects to transfer the accumulated pension credits out of the pension plan on termination, any amounts in excess of the CRA maximum are taxable.\nWhat happens to the taxable excess depends on the provisions of the applicable pension legislation. The pension legislation may require that the taxable excess be refunded to the employee. If it is no longer locked in and is refunded to the employee, it is treated as a lump-sum pension benefit for EI purposes. This is because accumulated pension credits are being refunded after lock-in has occurred (Digest 5.13.6). Pension credits, which are no longer locked-in under the provisions of pension legislation, are considered payable, even if the claimant arranges for their direct transfer to a RRSP or purchases a RRIF. Pension legislation may require that the taxable excess be transferred to a locked in vehicle or remain within the employer's pension plan, only to be used to fund an annuity. If under the pension legislation the taxable excess is still considered locked-in and may only be used to fund an annuity, the pension credits cannot be considered payable until the annuity is actually payable (Digest 5.13.4; Digest 5.13.5).",0.9977355
324,324,324,"Pensions and pension credits are seen as a shared asset in court cases involving marriage endings. This means that the pension could be split between the spouses just like any other shared property. The ownership of a pension can be moved from one person to another legally. Once this is done, the pension is no longer solely owned by the original person entitled to it. If part of the pension money is directed to another party by the owner, it doesn't count as a legal transfer. This splitting of pension assets can happen during a separation or divorce, or even while a couple is still married under Canadian or Quebec Pension Plans.

As such, the ownership of the pension may be divided between the spouses, like any other form of marital asset or property.\nLike property, the right to a pension can be legally transferred from one person to another. Once the rights to a pension have been legally transferred or disposed of, the pension is no longer owned entirely by the individual who first had the right to it. Since the ownership of that pension is no longer only the claimant's, the total amount can no longer be considered their pension benefits. However, it must be a legal transfer of ownership or rights, not simply a direction by the owner that part of the moneys due them be paid to another party (Digest 5.13.12.1).\nThis division of pension assets can occur when a couple separates or divorces. However, it can also occur under the Canada or Quebec Pension Plans while a couple is still married (Digest 5.13.12.2). The general principle used in dealing with these types of cases is the following:\nOnce the rights to the asset (that is, the claimant's pension credits, or the pension itself) have been legally and formally assigned or transferred to the spouse, the assigned or transferred portion is no longer the claimant's pension income. The test used to determine this is not to whom the pension payments are distributed or paid, but rather who is entitled to the moneys, or who has a vested right to them.",0.9984251
325,325,325,"When a married couple decides to separate, the court usually divides their pension benefits based on how long they were together while the pension was being earned. This division might not always be half of one spouse's pension. For the split to affect the pension earnings, one spouse must legally transfer their pension rights to the other, not just use the pension to settle a financial obligation from the separation. Once part of the pension is legally given to the other spouse through a separation or divorce agreement, it no longer counts as income for the original owner. Whether a portion of the pension now belongs to one spouse depends on the paperwork provided, like a separation agreement or divorce decree explicitly mentioning the pension separation, not just orders for alimony or child support. If the pension is divided as per the legal agreement, it doesn't matter if the payment is issued in one sum to one spouse; the part meant for the other spouse should still be transferred. The number of payments from the pension administrator doesn't prove the pension division, and getting separate payments could just be a way to make it easier for the spouse to meet their financial obligations.",51.12512315270936,13.332807881773402,12.785403640627711,15.54088669950739,15.90073891625616,11.681379310344829,57.57142857142857,8.285714285714286,0.9004645844300588,0.9268811106681824,2.798705195749531,0.2849833309498196,0.4261335389414206,0.0449099249307074,4.847290640394089,4.0,2.469783909747644,29.0,32.0,8.0,1.4926108374384237,1.0,0.7838861014082799,203,108,0.5320197044334976,1008,7,5.13.12.1,Pension split due to marital dissolution,Chapter 5 - Earnings,"In deciding on cases of marital dissolution, the courts have normally split the entitlement to the pension or the pension credits, based on co-habitation during the period the contributions were made. This may not necessarily be one-half of the claimant's pension. For the purposes of determining whether this split will have an effect on the pension earnings of the claimant, the claimant must be transferring the right to the pension, or the ownership of the pension, and not simply arranging to use the pension to satisfy a financial obligation connected with the marital dissolution. If the rights to a portion of the pension have been legally transferred to the spouse, under the terms of a separation or divorce, then that portion is no longer pension income of the claimant. The amount transferred will not constitute earnings of the spouse who receives that portion of their former spouse's pension. This is because these moneys do not arise out of the receiving spouse's pension contributions during their employment.\nWhether part of the pension paid or payable to a claimant is no longer their property, and whether it has become the property of their spouse, will depend on the documentation presented. This documentation should be in the form of a separation agreement, order or decree, or a divorce decree (nisi or absolute), that clearly states that the pension rights have been divided between the 2 spouses. The documentation must contain a specific reference to the division of the pension rights and not be merely an order to pay alimony or child support. An order to pay alimony or child support is a financial obligation of a claimant, which they may use their pension to satisfy. Satisfying financial obligations does not alter the fact that this money remains paid or payable, and belongs to the claimant (Digest 5.6.1).\nIf the pension has been divided by a separation or divorce decree or agreement, then it does not matter if one payment for the full amount is issued directly to the claimant. The portion belonging to the spouse will not be earnings of the claimant, as the claimant is considered to be legally acting as a trustee only, for the spouse's portion, even if they initially receive both portions. The claimant would be legally bound to forward the spouse's portion to the former spouse. On the other hand, the fact that a pension plan administrator makes separate payments is not sufficient to prove that the pension rights have been divided, and that the amount of earnings determination should be reduced. An arrangement to have more than one payment issued may be made simply to facilitate the claimant's discharge of legal obligations to pay alimony or child support.",0.9864249

If the person who didnâ€™t contribute to the pension starts to contribute, the sharing can also be stopped. 

The couple can also choose to end the sharing of the pension whenever they want. If the person with the pension can prove that they shared part of it, that amount wonâ€™t count as their income.

327,327,327,"Pensions are different from regular earnings because they are paid for the rest of someone's life. If we treated pension income like regular earnings in every situation, it wouldn't be fair. For example, someone who starts a job after they begin receiving a pension would have to pay employment insurance (EI) premiums on that job. But if they lose that job, they might not be eligible for EI benefits, or they might get less money. However, pension income can be excluded from being counted as earnings in some cases.

When it comes to meeting the criteria for exempting pension income, the person must have enough work hours to qualify for EI benefits. These hours must be earned after the pension payments start, and the person must continue to receive pension payments while earning these hours.

If a person is getting more than one pension, each pension is evaluated separately to see if it meets the exemption criteria. It's important to consider when each pension started because the hours worked during that time may count towards meeting the exemption criteria for each pension.

To qualify for the exemption, the hours worked must be from a job taken after starting to receive the pension payments. The person doesn't necessarily need to have received the pension during this time, as long as it was supposed to be paid. If the pension stops being paid because the person goes back to work, the hours worked during that time won't count towards the exemption.

In some cases, the employer might allow the person to restart contributing to the pension plan if they leave and come back to work. If this happens, the hours worked during this period can count towards meeting the exemption criteria.

The exemption rules also apply to CPP and QPP pensions if a person starts working again after receiving these pensions. If someone cancels their CPP or QPP pension, the accumulated hours may no longer count towards the exemption. However, this doesn't apply if the pension was changed from early retirement to a disability pension.

Hours worked during a period when pension bridging benefits are paid can also count towards meeting the exemption criteria. The same goes for pensions paid in a lump sum that are then converted to annuities.

Simply transferring pension credits from one plan to another won't help meet the exemption criteria. The transferred credits are meant to support pension payments in the future, not for meeting the exemption rules.

If a person meets the exemption conditions for a pension, any later increases in that pension due to inflation adjustments will also be exempt.",64.17537194746564,9.310585881387237,11.479024033405114,12.298337779601887,11.210032833983178,10.908893905191878,48.353067925302696,5.681818181818182,0.8656592283930097,0.8819295138120651,2.617399508554441,0.2952421216240201,0.4694427111603043,0.0796164164688312,4.792325056433409,4.0,2.3588333120660687,20.13636363636364,20.0,3.481058545190144,1.4446952595936795,1.0,0.7101251500994129,443,169,0.3814898419864559,2183,22,5.13.13,Requalifier exemption for pension earnings,Chapter 5 - Earnings,"Pensions are different than all other types of earnings, because they continue to be paid for life. To consider the same pension as earnings on every claim for the entire life of the claimant would result in inequities. To do so would mean that claimants who become re-employed after starting to receive a pension would pay EI premiums on that employment, but if they become unemployed may never be able to collect EI benefits, or may only be entitled to reduced benefits. Although pension income is earnings, these earnings can be exempted from allocation if all 3 of the following conditions are met (EIR 35(7)(e)):\n\nthe claimant must accumulate the number of insured hours required to establish a claim (including claims for special benefits)\nthe insurable hours must be accumulated after the date the pension became payable, and\nthe claimant must be receiving pension payments during the entire period they are accumulating the required insured hours\n\nIt does not matter whether an insured hour for a pension requalifier is from fishing or regular employment. Fishing insured hours for regular claims are obtained by using a formula that converts insurable earnings to insurable hours (EIR Fishing 13). For fishing claims, it is not insured hours but insured earnings from self-employment in fishing that determines whether the pension requalifier exemption is met (EIR Fishing 2; EIR Fishing 8; EIR 35(7)e). Pension requalifier insured hours may be earned with any employer, including the employer who is paying the pension.\nWhere a claimant is receiving more than one pension, each pension must be considered separately, for requalification. Pension start dates are critical to this determination. The same insured hours may be counted towards requalifier insured hours for more than one pension, as long as each of the pensions was paid or payable during that period.\nTo be considered pension requalifier insured hours, the hours must be accumulated in employment held after the start date of the pension payments, or after the start date that a pension became payable. It is not essential that the claimant actually have received the pension during this period (for example, when payment is delayed due to administrative difficulties), as long as the pension was payable. It is when the insurable hours are worked in relation to when the pension is paid or became payable that is relevant (Digest 5.6.1.2). \nTo be considered a pension requalifier insured hour, the pension payment must continue during the entire period of employment from which the claimant is accumulating the required insured hours. Some pension plans have a provision that suspends payment of a pension during any subsequent period of employment covered under the same pension plan, with the same employer, or a subsidiary of that employer. If the pension payment is suspended during a subsequent period of employment, the hours worked do not count towards meeting the pension requalifier insured hours (CUB 80755).\nOther pension plans may require the individual to repay the pension received and resume making pension contributions on the new employment, if they subsequently become re-employed with the same organization. Any insured hours accumulated during a period a claimant was required to repay a pension do not count towards pension requalifier insured hours.\nIn some cases, the employer may forgo repayment of the pension received during the entire period or part of the period of re-employment, and allow the employee to restart contributing to the same pension plan. In these situations, any hours of insurable employment accumulated during the EI qualifying period, during which the claimant was re-employed and was in receipt of a pension, would count towards pension requalifier insured hours, even if they restarted contributing to the company's pension plan.\nThe requalifier exemptions also apply to CPP and QPP retirement pensions, should the claimant start subsequent employment after pension payments start. Any insured hours accumulated during a period in which CPP or QPP was paid or payable, count as pension requalifier insured hours.\nA recipient may cancel their CPP or QPP pension within 6 months of the first payment. If the CPP or QPP pension is cancelled, all benefits received must be repaid, and contributions must continue to be made on any new CPP or QPP pensionable earnings. If the claimant cancels their CPP or QPP, any insured hours previously accumulated in relation to the exemption of the pension are no longer counted for this purpose. This is not the case if an early retirement CPP or QPP pension in cancelled in favour of a CPP or QPP disability pension.\nInsured hours accumulated during a period in which pension bridging benefits are paid or payable to bridge to a future company pension, CPP/QPP or OAS payments, meet the conditions to be considered pension requalifier insured hours. When the company's pension plan becomes payable (if not already being paid), payments under that pension are exempted as earnings, if the claimant accumulated the required insured hours while the pension bridging benefits were paid or payable.\nThe requalifier exemption also applies to pensions that are paid in a lump sum and have been converted to an annuity. In these cases, the pension requalifier insured hours must have been accumulated after the lump sum became payable.\nSimply transferring pension credits from one pension plan to another cannot allow the claimant to accumulate pension requalifier insured hours. With a transfer of pension credits, no pension is paid or payable to the employee, as these credits will support the payment of a pension at a later date, when the employee retires.\nIf a claimant has obtained a requalifier exemption of a pension amount, any subsequent increases of that pension due to indexing of the pension would also be exempt.",0.9753702
328,328,328,"Some people can't keep working until they reach retirement age because of health problems. Employers might offer help to these employees in two main ways: through either a long-term disability wage-loss plan or a disability pension. These two are kind of similar but have some important differences when it comes to how they affect things like Employment Insurance benefits.

A disability pension is a regular payment meant for someone who has a long-term or even permanent disability. The payments usually last a long time, sometimes even the person's whole life. These payments don't typically get reduced if the person gets another job or earns other money. They're different from long-term disability payments which might only cover someone for a couple of years if they can't do their usual job.

Disability pensions are usually part of a pension plan and are distinct from retiring early. The amount a person gets is based on how long they've worked or how long they would've worked if they hadn't been hurt. Some disability pensions are set up in a way that combines features of both a disability pension and a wage-loss payment.

In some cases, a person might be able to choose between getting regular payments over time or getting all the money at once in a lump sum. If a disability pension eventually changes into a retirement pension at a certain age, then it's no longer considered a disability pension, and at that point, it will count as earnings.

When someone gets a disability pension, sometimes they might also get additional benefits, like adjustments for increased costs of living earlier than usual. These extra benefits also won't count as earnings until the person reaches a certain age.",63.45666382252561,9.607637737688933,11.89987334104582,12.876548025353486,11.169678205753293,10.419658703071669,46.86713798147245,5.428571428571429,0.7973939730570867,0.8276659746964773,2.9115420681897786,0.4312997477503167,0.4292314844147647,0.0701197029713902,4.699658703071672,4.0,2.5124739761410524,20.928571428571427,23.0,5.457161555689731,1.4436860068259385,1.0,0.7974379176251322,293,150,0.5119453924914675,1432,14,5.13.14,Disability pensions,Chapter 5 - Earnings,"Not all individuals are physically able to continue working until retirement age. An employer can choose to provide coverage for employees who are no longer able to work, through either a long-term disability wage-loss indemnity plan or a disability pension (Digest 5.11.2). As the purpose of a long-term disability wage-loss indemnity plan and a disability pension are somewhat similar, they share some of the same characteristics and may be difficult to differentiate at first glance. Nevertheless, the effect of each type of payments is not the same, for EI benefit purposes. Disability pensions of any kind are specifically excluded as earnings, whereas, wage-loss indemnity payments that are paid from a group plan are earnings (EIR 35(7)(a); EIR 35(2)(c)(i)). As disability pensions are not specifically defined in the legislation, the ordinarily accepted meaning is applicable. This also includes CPP/QPP disability pensions.\nPension plans may provide for retirement due to disability. A retirement due to disability is not the same as taking early retirement. Disability provisions contained within a pension plan are designed to provide income support when an individual can no longer work due to a disability, but cannot otherwise qualify for a retirement pension.\nThe amount of a disability pension is often equal to the regular pension accumulated up to the date of the disability, without the actuarial reduction that is often made when early retirement is taken for non-disability reasons. However, some pension plans may provide a disability pension based on both past and prospective service. In these cases, the pension is equal to what the employee would have received, had the employee stayed employed until normal retirement age, at their present salary.\nAnother approach is to integrate a deferred pension with a long-term wage-loss indemnity plan, should one exist, allowing the employee to accumulate pension service credits for the entire period of the disability. This allows the employee to receive long-term disability payments until normal retirement age, and then receive a pension based on the years of actual work, plus the years of disability.\nThe distinction between a disability pension and disability wage-loss indemnity benefit may seem difficult to draw. Both are likely to terminate should the disability terminate, and both are designed to replace income that the individual could have earned had the disabling disease or accident not occurred. However, a disability pension generally has the following characteristics (CUB 45917):\n\nit is a periodic payment made as compensation for what is expected to be a permanent disability\npayments are likely to last over a long period of time, usually the lifetime of the employee\r\n\t\t\t\t\nthis period may not be as long depending on the length of the employment with the employer\nthis is unlike long-term disability indemnity payments which usually cover an individual for 24 months, for not being able to work in their own occupation\nafter the first 2 years, the plan may only continue to pay if the employee is unable to perform any occupation for which the employee is qualified through education, training, and experience\n\n\nthere is no requirement for the individual to look for and accept work that the individual may be able to perform\nthe provision for the disability pension is usually contained in the pension plan itself, and is distinct from early retirement\nthe amount of the pension is not reduced should the individual obtain other employment or receive any other amounts designed to replace wages\nit is not necessary that the employee have retired from all employment, just that they are retiring from that particular occupation, at that particular employer. The individual is not precluded from working as long as they can find work that they are able to do\nthe amount paid is related to the individual's past years of service or prospective years of service, in the same fashion as an ordinary pension, and is not based on the individual's current salary. There are some disability pensions that are hybrid plans, combining the features of a disability pension with a top-up amount that is more in line with a wage-loss indemnity payment\nit is paid beyond age 65, or it may switch to a regular pension at that time\nany unpaid benefits at death are paid to the spouse\nthere is usually no requirement for a waiting period, or integration with other wage-loss benefits, although it may take some time for the assessment process to be completed, and\nit can be likened to permanent settlement workers' compensation payments\n\nIn certain cases, a person may have the option of receiving a lump-sum payment in lieu of periodic payments. When lump-sum payments are substituted for the periodic payments the claimant would be entitled to under a pension plan, this sum is treated as a disability pension.\nDisability pensions, which convert to retirement pensions at a specified age, under the terms of the pension plan, no longer have the character of a disability pension. These pensions have become retirement pensions. As such, they are considered as earnings from the date they are converted to the retirement pension and are allocated, unless the claimant meets the pension requalifier conditions (Digest 5.13.13).\nSince it is the nature of the pension that has changed, and not the pension plan source, nor the period paid, any insured hours accumulated while in receipt of the disability pension count towards pension requalifier insured hours and the exemption of the retirement pension.\nIn some pension plans, for those individuals who can establish that they are disabled, indexing may be paid at an earlier age than it normally would. In these cases, the indexed amount is not considered as earnings as it qualifies as a disability pension. This exemption continues until the age that the indexing would normally commence, at which time the indexed amount would be considered as earnings.",0.8883576
329,329,329,"Regulation Explanation

Regulation 35(1) states that a pension is retirement income from working, being in the military or police, or from government plans like CPP or QPP.

Regulation 35(2)(e) explains that money received periodically or as a lump sum instead of a pension is considered earnings.

Regulation 35(7)(a) clarifies that disability pensions do not count as earnings.

Regulation 35(7)(e) says that pensions do not count as earnings if enough employment hours have been accumulated.

Pensions That Do Not Count as Earnings

Pensions like Survivor's or Old Age Security Pensions, War Veterans Allowance, and others are not considered as earnings as they are not related to a person's work.

Pensions That Count as Earnings

Pension earnings need to be assigned and allocated based on specific rules mentioned in regulations 36(14), 36(15), and 36(17).

Specific Cases Regarding Pension Earnings

Various scenarios, like returning pension contributions, bridging benefits, alimony or child support, and additional voluntary contributions are explained in different regulations for how they affect pension earnings.

Understanding Pension Regulations

Different rules apply to pensions based on where the money is coming from and how it's being paid out, and whether it should be considered as earnings or not.

330,330,330,"A bonus is something extra given to an employee on top of their regular pay to encourage good work. A gratuity is a voluntary gift given in return for a service. Both bonuses and gratuities are often used similarly in business. When employers pay these, it is seen as income earned from the job. However, if a gift is given due to friendship rather than the job, it's not considered work-related income. Customers can also give gratuities, which may be considered work-related if given for services rendered. 

The timing of when bonuses and gratuities are given depends on whether they are connected to work done or a specific event. For example, if a bonus is linked to reaching production goals, it is allocated to the period when those goals were achieved. Similarly, bonuses related to holidays are allocated to the week of the holiday. Bonuses or gratuities given after a lay-off are dated from the time of the lay-off. If none of these situations apply, the bonus or gratuity is allocated to the period when the services were provided or the event occurred.",65.2877272727273,8.398858800773695,11.20814326018867,11.517214700193424,8.586039651837524,9.272127659574464,42.09090909090909,4.2727272727272725,0.814163076877594,0.8025513953632779,2.6105193159936246,0.5589069871308315,0.4860096556934502,0.0734150093069706,4.558510638297872,4.0,2.526830896112045,17.09090909090909,17.0,4.399474048204676,1.4680851063829787,1.0,0.7537442376135468,188,96,0.5106382978723404,882,11,5.14.0,Bonuses gratuities and tips,Chapter 5 - Earnings,"A bonus is defined as something which is given in addition to what is expected or strictly due, or given in addition to an employee's usual compensation; an incentive to employees to provide efficient and faithful service. A gratuity is defined as something given voluntarily or beyond obligation, usually in return for or in anticipation of some form of service. While there is a voluntary element in both these definitions, in modern business usage the terms have broadened to include amounts that could be included in the terms of a collective agreement. In addition, bonuses and gratuities have become, in many cases, an incentive to ensure employees provide good service (production bonuses), or do something (signing bonuses). Consequently, a bonus or gratuity is not necessarily an unsolicited and unexpected gift from employer to employee. Both the terms, bonus and gratuity, are often used interchangeably in practice.\nThere is usually no question that bonuses and gratuities are earnings when they are paid by employers, since these amounts are clearly income arising out of employment (EIR 35(2)). This is true even if the person who pays the bonus is representing  the employer, such as a receiver in bankruptcy proceedings. However, gratuities that are gifts from an employer to an employee because of their personal relationship or friendship, rather than the employer-employee relationship, do not arise out of employment. The personal relationship is prompting the gift, and not the employment relationship (Digest 5.3.1.5). The giving of a wedding gift to an employee when it is not the employer's practice to do so, for example, may be more closely linked to a friendship between the employer and the employee, than to the employment relationship.\nSomeone other than an employer, such as a customer, may give gratuities. If a connection is established between the employment, the work performed, and the reason for the gratuitous payment, the gratuity is considered to arise out of employment. This is the case when a customer tips a server (Digest 5.14.7). However, if the gratuity given is not related to the work performed or the services provided, such as due to a personal relationship or friendship, the gratuity cannot be said to be arising out of employment. In this situation, the relationship itself prompted the payment, and not the services performed by the claimant.\nThe allocation of bonuses and gratuities is governed by whether the payment is more closely linked to the services performed, or to a particular event or transaction. In other words, the reason for the payment. Some specific allocation situations are as follows:\n\nbonuses and gratuities which have a specific link to measurable production goals and the services required to meet those goals, are allocated to the period in which those services were performed (EIR 36(4))\nbonuses and gratuities most closely linked to a holiday or non-working day are allocated to the week in which the holiday occurred (EIR 36(13))\nbonuses and gratuities paid or payable by reason of a lay-off or separation should be allocated from the date of the event, either the lay-off or the separation, which gave right to the payment (EIR 36(9); EIR 36(10))\nbonuses or gratuities to which none of the other subsections apply are allocated to the period in which the services are performed or to the week of the event or transaction (EIR 36(19))",0.9962961
331,331,331,"Production bonuses are extra payments given to workers when they meet or go beyond set levels of production, sales, or service. Many industries use these bonuses to encourage workers to stay productive. They can be a part of the job agreement, based on a written policy, or agreed upon collectively. Sometimes, these bonuses are a surprise when a company has had a really good year. What's important is that these bonuses are tied to doing more work than expected, either by an individual or a group, within a certain timeframe. How these bonuses are calculated can depend on a formula that considers an individual's or a group's performance over a set period. It might be based on hours worked, amount of work done, or other factors that make sense for the industry or job. These bonuses could be a regular part of a salary or a lump sum paid out periodically or yearly when possible. Since production bonuses are directly linked to the work done during a specific time, they should be divided proportionally based on the work done each week. If they are paid regularly, they should be split based on the work done each week. If the amount of work done each week is unknown, like when the bonus is paid once a year, then the bonus should be spread out evenly over all the weeks in the period it covers.",72.4144245025361,8.421123683183772,10.436869588844216,11.562856028092082,10.204299648849007,9.073304721030038,40.065938353492,4.0,0.8581252694129944,0.8584225376447042,2.8346034660731325,0.6397843090177204,0.4668512848431712,0.0684138668588327,4.467811158798283,4.0,2.4634744503997754,21.181818181818183,21.0,6.307545003164238,1.3347639484978542,1.0,0.6677372334603007,233,121,0.51931330472103,1071,11,5.14.1,Production bonuses,Chapter 5 - Earnings,"Production bonuses are paid when workers meet or exceed specified levels of production, sales or service. All types of industries employ these bonuses as a form of incentive to maintain or increase productivity. Production bonuses may be part of the employment contract, either by custom or by an explicit written policy or collective agreement. Production bonuses may also be paid unexpectedly because of a particularly good year. The central factor is that they are based on exceeding specific work levels, during a specific period, and performance of either the individual, or the individual's work unit.\nThe calculation of production bonuses may be based on a formula related to individual or group performance, during a specified period. It may be based on the hours worked, the amount of work performed, or any other measurable criteria that suits the industry, the company, the job, or the situation (FCA A-600-92, CUB 20966). It may be paid regularly as part of the employee's salary, or in a lump sum periodically or annually, as the employer is able to pay.\nAs production bonuses are directly related to the amount of work performed in a specified period, they are allocated as any payments made under a contract of employment for the performance of services (EIR 36(4)).

333,333,333,"Event bonuses are extra payments that some employees receive during special occasions like holidays, work anniversaries, or the end of the fiscal or calendar year. These bonuses can be in the form of money or non-cash gifts like a Christmas turkey or a retirement present. They are usually fixed amounts given at once, not calculated based on work performance or time employed. Common types of event bonuses include Christmas bonuses, signing bonuses, and bonuses for a good year or long service awards.

Event bonuses are often flat, set payments with no specific calculation method. They might be given as a surprise by the employer or could be based on company tradition or policy. Sometimes, they are agreed upon in union negotiations. Unlike production bonuses tied to work performance, event bonuses are given mainly because of the occasion.

Whether event bonuses are regular, like an annual Christmas bonus, or rare, like a bonus for working 25 years, they are given to mark the event itself. This sets them apart from bonuses linked to specific work goals. If the event falls on a holiday or day off, the bonus is usually given for that week.

These bonuses may be cash or a non-pecuniary gift like a Christmas turkey or a retirement gift (Digest 5.3.2.1). They are usually lump-sum amounts, rather than based on a formula related to the period or conditions of employment. The most common types of event bonuses are Christmas bonuses, signing bonuses, a good-year bonus, or a cash or gift given as a length of service award.\nEvent bonuses are usually flat, fixed lump-sum payments, with no grading in the method of calculation. They may be gratuitous, unexpected and unsolicited expressions by the employer, or there may be a custom, or even a written employer's policy, that governs their payment. In relatively rare cases, they may be included in a collective agreement, as the result of employer-employee negotiations.\nWhether an event bonus is paid regularly, (for example, annually at Christmas), or is an isolated occurrence (for example, only when an employee has worked 25 years with that employer), it is paid primarily because of the event. This is the basic distinction between this type of bonus and a production bonus. Although it can be said that employers generally want to reward only good, productive employees, an event bonus lacks the specific link to measurable production goals and the services required to meet those goals. As there is no specific link to the services performed, an event bonus is allocated to the week of the event that caused the payment to be made.\nIf the event is a holiday or non-working day, the bonus would be allocated to the week in which that event occurred (that is, the week in which the holiday or non-working day falls) (EIR 36(13)).

However, the terms of the collective agreement must be examined to ensure the bonus is in fact being paid for this reason. Signing bonuses are sometimes offered by the employer as a result of the employment contract negotiation process. This most commonly occurs when a collective agreement has taken some time to negotiate. The employer may agree to pay all regular employees a set amount of money in lieu of a retroactive wage increase or a set amount as an incentive to sign. The amount is often the same for all regular employees regardless of the wage, the job, the employee's position or the number of hours worked. This lump sum saves the employer the expense and trouble of calculating a wage increase for the prior period. The employer may prorate the signing bonus in some manner for part-time or temporary employees.\nThe language in a collective agreement may not specifically refer to signing bonuses.  It is imperative that the terms and conditions of the agreement be examined to determine the real nature of the payment. More often than not, regardless of the name given to this payment, its principal purpose is as an incentive to promote the ratification of the collective agreement by the workers. These signing bonuses can usually only be paid when the contract is ratified by the membership, or signed and finalized. Often the collective agreement may contain 2 parts: the Central Agreement (part I) and local agreements (part II).  In these cases, the signing bonuses do not become payable until both parts of the agreement have been ratified. Signing bonuses are considered paid by reason of an event or transaction (ratification of the contract) and are therefore allocated to the week of that event or transaction (CUB 77513).",0.99544984

This bonus is usually calculated at the end of the calendar or fiscal year after the company's books have been audited to determine its profitability. The idea behind a good-year bonus is that if the company did well, then all the employees contributed to that success and should share in the profits.

If the bonus is directly tied to the amount of work done by an individual or the company as a whole, it is called a productivity bonus. This type of bonus rewards employees based on their performance. If the bonus is not based on any specific formula related to the company's profits or other measurable criteria, it is considered more of a general reward rather than a performance-based bonus.

This type of bonus generally recognizes the overall productivity of the company rather than the work of an individual or of a group of workers. The good-year bonus is usually calculated at the end of the calendar or fiscal year when the books are audited, and it is known what the profitability of the company was in the previous year. The premise of a good-year bonus is that if the company had a good year, all the workers were good employees, and should share in the good fortunes of the company. If the good-year bonus can be directly linked to the amount of work performed by the individual, or by the company as a whole (for example, a percentage of the profits paid to the workers), then the bonus would be a productivity bonus, and allocated to the period in which the services were performed (EIR 36(4); Digest 5.14.1). A lump-sum payment that is not based on any formula related to the profitability of the company, or any other measurable criteria, cannot be directly related to the employee's work. Such a bonus is more related to a transaction, whether that is the finalization of the company books, or a decision to reward the employees for a good year.\nOccasionally there is an extra condition of payment, such as a return to work. If a bonus would never be paid if the employee did not return to work, or if any condition for payment was not fulfilled, then the event is the fulfilment of all the required conditions.

336,336,336,"End-of-season bonuses are rewards given to workers who stay and work for the whole season or finish a certain amount of work within a set time. These bonuses are usually found in industries where the working season is short, like farming or tourism. The main reason for these bonuses is to encourage workers to stay until the end of the season and not leave early. If a worker quits before the season ends, they often lose some or all of their bonus. Not getting the bonus can act as a negative consequence to stop workers from leaving early.
  
Workers should know the rules for earning end-of-season bonuses before they start the job. Knowing these rules is part of the job agreement and can be seen as a right of the worker. The bonus might be a fixed amount, an increase in pay based on hours worked, or linked to the type of work done. The bonus is mostly tied to the work done instead of when it's paid out, but one condition to get the bonus is usually completing the season as agreed in the contract. In other words, the bonus is given at the end of the season.

End-of-season bonuses are common in seasonal industries where the season is very short. The main purpose of this kind of bonus is to offer employees a strong incentive to stay with the employer until they are no longer needed and to not leave early. If an employee leaves early for any reason, voluntary or not, all or a significant portion of the bonus is usually lost. The monetary impact of not fulfilling the terms required for payment of a bonus may be a negative incentive or deterrent.\nThe terms and conditions for end-of-season bonuses should be known when the offer of employment is accepted. Therefore, it is an express condition of the employment and may be considered a contractual right of the employee.

It is therefore not a production bonus to be allocated over the period in which the services were performed. Separation or retirement bonuses are paid or payable by reason of a lay-off or separation.

Normally, when someone leaves a job, they might not receive any severance pay.

Employers may refer to these bonuses as production bonuses, but there are often no specific guidelines related to production levels.

Closure bonuses are offered as an incentive to maintain production levels, complete necessary orders for shipment before closure, or prevent sabotage during the final weeks of a company's operation. However, in any work situation, the employer normally expects that an employee will remain on the job as long as required, and any employee who quits often forfeits the right to any severance pay. Therefore, by making the payment of a closure bonus conditional upon staying, the employer is only reinforcing a normally accepted condition of employment. This type of bonus is normally paid at the time of, or just prior to, the closure date.\nEmployers often call these bonuses a production bonus, but the link to production is usually general and vague, with no measurable conditions of payment except that the claimant forfeits payment by leaving before the closure date (CUB 26019). If a direct relationship between the right to the money and the production levels can be established, then the bonus would be allocated over the period from the time the closure was announced to the date of closure (FCA A-600-92, CUB 20966).\nWhenever a bonus is paid to employees, the reason for the payment must be examined. If the company has set no objective productivity goals except to maintain production, then the bonus, especially if paid just prior to, or at the time of the closure, is considered to be paid or payable by reason of the separation.

These plans differ in how and when employees receive their compensation and pay taxes on it. It's important to know which part of the Income Tax Act the plans are registered under to understand what type of profit sharing plan is in place.",65.60001886792455,9.37611320754717,11.602472056035309,12.630943396226415,12.76443396226415,12.259245283018863,46.67169811320755,5.4,0.8415278047323227,0.863851527372996,2.8325363075058814,0.4960837261641923,0.5185318535419955,0.0489114981877866,5.009433962264151,5.0,2.3411627614985884,21.2,21.0,6.675327707311455,1.4150943396226414,1.0,0.725127503795307,106,65,0.6132075471698113,543,5,5.15.0,Profit sharing plans,Chapter 5 - Earnings,"Employers use profit sharing plans as a way of rewarding the good performance of their employees.

This plan is considered a type of direct payment because the rewards are given out periodically instead of waiting until the employee leaves the job. This is the most basic kind of profit sharing plan and does not need approval from tax authorities. Any money or stock given out is considered part of the employee's earnings from work, so it gets taxed in the same year it's received.

Occasionally company stock may be distributed, rather than cash and the employer determines the distribution schedule. As the distribution is made periodically, rather than being held until the participant leaves employment, this plan is a form of direct compensation.\nThis is the simplest form of profit sharing plans. It does not require registration with the CRA as all profit sharing payments are made directly to the employee in cash or stock certificates. Taxation is not deferred, and occurs in the year that these moneys are paid.\r\nAny cash, or the value of any stock distributed to the employees, is earnings arising out of employment (EIR 35(2)). Like all profit sharing plans, the payment of these moneys is linked to the services provided by the employees in their daily work, that assist the company in earning profits. As the share in the profits arises from the performance of services, these earnings are allocated to the week or weeks in which the services were performed (EIR 36(6)).",0.9994856
342,342,342,"In an employee's profit sharing plan, a part of the company's annual profits is put into a trust fund. This money is then given to employees who are a part of the plan, along with the interest earned in that year. The distribution of this money can be based on how much the employee earns, how long they have worked for the company, or another method.

The money in the trust account usually stays there until the employee leaves their job. However, in some cases, employees can take out cash from the fund while they are still working. Employees can also choose to add their own money to this fund, but these contributions cannot be used to reduce taxes.

Ownership rights of the money that the employer puts into the profit sharing plan can differ. It might belong fully to the employee right away, or it might only become fully theirs when they die, leave the company, or retire. If ownership is not immediate, employees cannot withdraw cash while they are still working because they do not have complete rights to the money.

Even though employees may not get any money from this trust fund until they retire or leave their job, they have to pay taxes each year on their share of the profits, the interest earned, and any profits made on investments. Employees do not have to pay income tax on the money they put into the fund because it comes from their already taxed income. This specific profit sharing plan is regulated by section 144 of the Income Tax Act.

The money in the profit sharing plan is considered earnings from work, but it is not seen as payable until the employee actually receives it. This money is linked to the work that employees do daily that helps the company make profits. The earnings are assigned to the time period when the work was done because the profits come from the work provided.

However, some plans may allow cash withdrawals by the employee, while still employed. Employees may also contribute to this fund, although these contributions are not tax deductible.\nVesting (full ownership rights) of the employer's profit sharing contributions can vary from immediate, to vesting only on death, termination of employment, or retirement. In cases where vesting is not immediate, cash withdrawals cannot be made while employed, as the employee has no right to these payments.\nAlthough a participant may not normally receive a distribution from this trust fund until retirement or until employment is terminated, the employee is taxed each year on their share of the profits, the interest accruing in the trust, and any realized capital gains, as though they were in immediate receipt of the moneys.

You won't pay income tax on the profit share you get or the interest your account earns until you actually receive this money. DPSPs are regulated more strictly under the Income Tax Act compared to regular profit sharing plans.

A DPSP is similar to a pension plan in some ways, but there are differences. In a DPSP, you might be able to take out some or all of the money in your account while you still work there, including the part your employer contributed. This isn't possible with a pension plan. When you leave your job or retire, any money you take out of a DPSP will be taxed, but you might be able to avoid some taxes if you use the money to buy an annuity or put it into a special savings plan. Pension plans usually don't let you take out a lump sum of money when you leave your job or retire.

The money in a DPSP comes from the work you did for the company. It's not considered yours until you actually get it.

The entire withdrawal above the employee's own contributions is taxed as income. At termination or retirement, lump-sum payments out of a DPSP are similarly taxed as income, but may be tax-sheltered if an annuity is purchased, or all or some of the payment is transferred to an individual RRSP.

344,344,344,"A profit sharing pension plan is a retirement plan where employers contribute money based on their profits. This type of plan follows the same rules and laws as other pension plans. The profit sharing part is just how the retirement fund gets money. Any money placed into the fund stays there until you retire or leave your job.

Just like other pension plans, profit sharing pension plans are regulated under the Income Tax Act. This means both the money you and your employer put in are tax deductible up to a certain limit. However, the interest earned on the money in the fund is not taxed. But when you start getting benefits from the plan, that money is considered taxable.

Usually, the money from a profit sharing pension plan can only be accessed as annuities when you retire because it's locked in. In special cases, like if you didn't lock in your contributions or have a shorter life expectancy, you might be able to get a one-time payment. 

Any money you receive from a profit sharing pension plan is considered earnings and is taxed. How you receive the moneyâ€”whether as a regular payment, one lump sum, or getting your contributions backâ€”depends on your situation.

351,351,351,"Engaging in running a business, like operating a corporation, counts as being self-employed. Any money earned from this self-employment is considered earnings for getting EI benefits.

If you make money from owning shares in a corporation but don't actually work for the corporation, this income isn't counted as earnings for EI benefits. However, if you own shares in a corporation and you also work for that corporation as an employee, your income could be considered earnings for EI benefits.

For example, if you work for a corporation and receive a salary, that salary is counted as earnings for EI benefits because you earned it through your employment. If you own shares in a corporation, you might also make money through dividends. Dividends are payments made to shareholders to give them a return on their investment in the corporation.

If you work for a corporation and also own shares, you're not considered self-employed just because you own shares. But if you own shares and are actively involved in running the business, you could be seen as being self-employed.

When a shareholder is involved in running the business, they might receive payment for some of their work or even none at all. This payment for work is considered earnings. For shareholders who are actively involved in running the business, their share of the income is considered earnings.

To be fair to everyone, the income earned by a shareholder who is actively involved in the business has to be looked at as earnings for EI benefits. This applies regardless of whether the business is set up as a corporation, sole proprietorship, partnership, or co-adventure.

In a corporate situation, how much money a shareholder gets is based on how many shares they own. Sometimes it's necessary to look into how much of the corporation's income belongs to the shareholder.

If you're self-employed, all the money you earn from running your business counts as earnings. You can't share this income with someone else unless they legally have a right to it.

Any income arising from that self-employment is earnings for EI benefit purposes.\nIncome received from owning shares in a corporation is not treated as earnings for EI benefit purposes if it does not arise out of employment, (that is, the claimant takes no part in the operation of the corporation) (Digest 4.6.3, Digest 5.3.1.6). However, a claimant who owns shares in a corporation could also work for that corporation as an employee under a contract of service, or may be engaged in operating that corporation as a business on their own account, or in a co-adventure (FCA A-296-86, CUB 12019). Some claimants may be paid as employees, but also perform additional functions for which wages or salaries are not paid.\nWhen a claimant is receiving any income from a corporation, it must be determined whether that income is from employment stemming from an employer-employee relationship, from the claimant's self-employment activities in operating a business, or merely from an investment in that business.\nIncome from a corporation is normally earned through the payment of wages or salaries, if the claimant is working for the corporation as an employee. Wages and salary arising out of contracts of employment with corporations are earnings for EI benefit purposes, as they arise directly out of employment.\nIf the claimant owns shares in a corporation, income may also arise through the payment of dividends. Dividends are paid to shareholders to provide a return on the shareholder's investment in the corporation. Directors of corporations decide if or when dividends are declared in a particular year. Additionally, there may be an increase in the value of the claimant's holdings in the corporation, if the net income earned during a specific period, is held by the corporation and not distributed to shareholders as dividends. Determining the claimant's role(s) in the corporation will reveal the type of income they receive.\nEmployees of a corporation may also be shareholders; that is, they are not benefiting from the corporation's profit, other than by virtue of an investment they have made, in order to receive dividends from shares or stocks. As employees, in addition to being shareholders, they hold a position in the organization, as do other workers; they are paid wages or salary, in return for their work. It cannot be concluded therefore, that persons working for a corporation, who also happen to hold shares of the same corporation, are self-employed.\nThe situation is not the same when it is determined that shareholders are engaged in operating a corporation as a business. A determination must be made as to the extent to which a shareholder is engaged in the operation of a business (Digest 4.6.3). While engaged in operating a corporation as a business, a shareholder may receive wages or salary from the corporation for only a portion of the hours worked, or they may not be compensated for the work at all, as an employee would. Payment received for any work performed under a contract of service is earnings from employment, however, it must be determined whether earnings arise from any work performed in operating the corporation, without payment.\nAlthough there is no provision in the EI legislation to attribute a value to work performed without wages or salary, any income arising out of self-employment is earnings for EI benefit purposes (EIR 35(1)(b)).\nClaimants who are shareholders engaged in operating a business as a corporation have argued that due to the corporation's status as a separate legal entity, the net income of the corporation belongs to the corporation, and should not be considered earnings of the claimant. However, claimants who are self-employed in operating a business on their own account, as a sole proprietor, or in a partnership or co-adventure, have their share of the income allocated as earnings. If the claimant's share of the income of a corporation was not considered as earnings, it would give an unfair advantage to those who choose to operate their business through the corporate form of business structure, over those who do so in a partnership or as a sole proprietorship.\nTo remove inequities in the treatment of earnings based on the structure of a business, one must pierce the corporate veil by looking beyond the fact that the business is a corporation, in order to consider earnings arising from self-employment in a corporation (Digest 4.6.8). The legal status of the operation or business in which the self-employed person works, is irrelevant (FCA A-136-96, CUB 31814, FCA A-296-86, CUB 12019).\nWhen the corporate veil is pierced, the claimant's engagement in the operation of the corporation is examined and any income from that self-employment is treated as earnings. The claimant's share of the earnings arising from that self-employment must be determined.\nIf there has been a determination that the claimant is self-employed, the fact that they did not actually receive the income is not relevant; the mere right to receive such income is sufficient (FCA A-136-96, CUB 31814). This applies equally to the farming sector, where, through the piercing of the corporate veil, farming transactions and subsidies of the corporation become the claimant's (Digest 5.16.9; Digest 5.16.2.5). Therefore, payment does not have to have been issued for a determination that the moneys are part of the entire income arising out of self-employment. The definition of income includes income that is received, or to be received from an employer or any other person (EIR 35(1)).\nFor those who work in self-employment, including farming, the net income from self-employment is the amount remaining after deducting the operating expenses, other than capital expenditures, from the gross income from that employment (EIR 35(10)). Since the claimant only has a right to their share of the net income of a corporation, it is this amount that is determined as earnings for EI benefit purposes, when the corporate veil is pierced.\nOnce it has been determined that the claimant is engaged in self-employment, all income from that self-employment is earnings. There is no provision to attribute only a portion of self-employed income as arising from the investment the claimant made in the business (EIR 35(10)). This is true whether the claimant is self-employed and operating their business as a sole proprietorship, through a partnership, co-adventure or corporation.\nIn a corporate situation, the claimant's portion of the income of the corporation is based on the claimant's investment in the corporation, which is represented by the percentage of shares owned. Piercing the corporate veil may be required to determine the claimant's share of income.\nThe claimant's share of the self-employment income is earnings. The claimant cannot assign any portion of that income to any other person, unless that person has a legal right to claim a share of the income from the business (CUB 31091). As well, the income cannot be excluded as earnings, should the claimant's share of the net income of the business be left within the business to meet current or future business obligations.",0.99551916
352,352,352,"When someone is self-employed and runs a business with others, only the money they personally make from the business is counted as their earnings. In a partnership, the money considered to be the person's share of the income is determined by the partnership agreement. This agreement might state a specific percentage of the profits to be shared, which could be different from the ownership percentage. In this situation, the person's share of the profits is based on the percentage outlined in the agreement, not the percentage of ownership they have. 

If it's confirmed that someone is self-employed, all the money they make from their self-employment must be looked at. It's not required by law to figure out how much of the self-employment income came from investing versus actual work. Some of the money earned through self-employment can't be excluded from being considered earnings just because it came from an investment rather than the work the person did. However, money earned from investments that are separate from the self-employment activities and meet specific investment income criteria are not counted as work earnings.

In partnerships, the portion of the earnings that are considered the claimant's share of the income are based on the terms of the partnership agreement. A partnership agreement may set out a percentage under which the net profits of the partnership are to be shared, which may be different than the percentage owned. In that case, the claimant's share of the net income is the percentage of net profits and not the percentage of ownership.\nOnce there is a finding that the claimant is self-employed, all income arising from that self-employment and its activities must be considered. There is no requirement by law, that earnings be analyzed further to determine what portion of the self-employment income arose from investment, versus the self-employment itself. A portion of the claimant's income from self-employment cannot be excluded from consideration as earnings on the basis that it was earned from an investment and not the labour of the claimant (CUB 31090). However, as already mentioned, moneys received from investments that do not arise out of the claimant's self-employment activities, and meet the criteria for investment income, are not considered arising out of employment (Digest 5.16.2.3).\nOnce it has been determined that the claimant is involved in self-employment, the claimant's share of the income is based on the claimant's entitlement according to ownership, or the terms of the partnership agreement, regardless of the extent of the claimant's personal involvement, work, or participation (CUB 59511).",0.99503183

However, it is the moneys or advantages that are earned by labour, or resemble them, that are earnings for EI benefit purposes (FCA A-178-86). Moneys must clearly display the character of a consideration given in return for work done by the recipient in order to be considered earnings (FCA A-597-94, CUB 25472).\nTherefore, all income support subsidies, intended to compensate for lost income, are considered when determining the income of a farmer.

Advances need to be paid back once the service is provided, the product is sold, or the wages are earned. When business profits are involved, the income is what's left after subtracting expenses. This income should be declared as it's earned, not when it's received. A draw is like an advance, where a business owner takes some money from the business based on their ownership stake.

These payments are earnings for EI benefit purposes.\nAn advance may be defined as money paid before it is due, or a loan. A business operator may receive an advance from the business on the wages or salary due to them, or on the business operator's share of the profits. A company may also pay advances based on anticipated sales of products. An advance is a payment for something, before entitlement to that payment is earned, such as:\nan advance on wages or salary\nan advance on commissions before the right to them has occurred\nan advance on sales or services before the right to that payment exists under the terms of the sales contract, or\nan advance taken by business owners on their share of the net income of the business\nAdvances must be repaid. Normally, the repayment of the advanced amount occurs when the product is sold, or when the wage, salary, commission or share of the profits is earned and payable. If the right to the expected payment does not occur, the person who receives the advance must still repay it.\nThe situation is slightly different when an advance against business profits, is received. Earnings from self-employment are the amount of the gross income from that employment, remaining after deducting the operating expenses. Therefore, the claimant should be declaring earnings as they are earned by the business, and not when the claimant is to receive their share of the net income.

The classification into which an expenditure falls depends on whether the expenditure is made for an item which is exhausted while earning the revenue for which it was incurred (that is, an operating expense), or for the purchase of an asset which continues to exist, and will benefit future operating periods of the business (that is, a capital expenditure).

As reported on the business' income statement, these expenses occur from delivering or producing goods, rendering services, or carrying out other activities that constitute the business entity's ongoing major or central operations.\nOperating expenses are the specific expenses and costs associated with a company's main activities to benefit a finite period as they are spent to obtain the revenue  earned in that period. They are deducted from the income earned over the same  period of time that the expenses were incurred. There are 2 types of  operating expenses, ongoing and job-specific, which may vary depending on the  type of business.\nOngoing expenses represent the cost of doing business and occur on a regular basis whether income is generated or not. These may include rent, insurance, wages or  salary for regular employees, licenses, and utilities. They may also include similar  day-to-day expenses such as supplies, property, sales and other taxes paid by  the business, advertising expenses, interest on business loans, maintenance or  repair costs, workers' compensation assessment fees, payroll taxes, and  depreciation. Entertainment expenses are also operating expenses where they are  required to obtain and maintain clientele or customers. Lawyer and accounting fees are also  considered operating expenses, unless these amounts are part of the start-up  costs of a business, in which case they are a capital expenditure.\nJob-specific operating expenses represent the cost associated with a particular activity of the business, that is, a specific product, job, sale, or work performed.  Job-specific operating expenses are costs such as additional wages or salary  for employees hired for that work, transportation expenses and materials.\nOperating expenses include only those expenses relating to the business and not expenses incurred for personal or family reasons. For example, bank charges applicable to the business are operating expenses. However, if the claimant is using a personal chequing account with a flat monthly service fee, to pay business expenses along with personal ones, this is not an operating expense. Operating expenses may also include costs incurred because the business operates out of the claimant's household; however, it must be demonstrated that these costs are in addition to the claimant's normal household expenses.\nIn a partnership, operating expenses may vary and are not necessarily split evenly between the partners. The percentage is based on the partnership agreement. Where one partner has removed themselves from the business for a temporary period of time, and an operating expense is incurred by hiring a replacement worker, only a percentage of that expense may be deducted from that partner's earnings. For example, if there are 2 equal partners, 50% of the cost of the replacement worker's wage may be deducted as an operating expense for the partner who is temporarily away from work. The cost of the replacement worker is an expense of the business, not the individual they are replacing.",0.9936706
362,362,362,"Capital expenditures are money spent to either buy new assets or improve existing ones. An asset is something valuable that is owned by a person or a company. These assets help a business make more money or have access to cash. These assets benefit the business for more than one year, and they are used to make money not just now, but also in the future.

Capital expenditures include buying things like land, buildings, computers, vehicles, paying back a loan, or buying a franchise. These expenditures are different from regular expenses a business has. If a business deducts the entire cost of an asset in one period, it can make the earnings for that time look wrong.

When a business spends money on assets that lose value over time (like equipment and buildings), they have something called operating expenses, which are essentially the cost of using those assets over time. This cost is known as depreciation. Depreciation happens with things like vehicles too. As long as the way a business calculates depreciation is fair and makes sense, it's seen as a normal expense.

Buying inventory is also a capital expenditure, not a regular business cost. Inventory is the items a business holds to sell, materials they use to make products, or products they're still working on.

An asset is a financial contract or physical object with value, that is owned by an individual or company, and which can be used to generate additional value or provide liquidity (Black's Law Dictionary). The assets benefit the business over one or more reporting periods, beyond the period of acquisition or improvement. A reporting period is usually one year. The asset is used, or will be used, to earn not only revenue in the current reporting period, but also revenue in future reporting periods. Capital expenditures are items such as the purchase of land, buildings, equipment such as computers and vehicles, the repayment of the principal amount on a loan, and the cost to purchase a franchise.\nA capital expenditure is not an operating expense. Deducting the entire cost of an asset from the income for a specific period when the asset will be used beyond that period distorts the match of revenue and expenses. This gives an erroneous picture of the earnings gained for that period, for EI benefit purposes.\nWhile the total cost for the purchase or improvement of assets cannot be deducted from gross income, capital expenditures made for the purchase/acquirement of assets with a limited life span, (for example, equipment and buildings), do have an operating expense associated with them. The operating expense most often associated with fixed assets is known as depreciation.\nDepreciation expenses or costs arise from capital expenditures on buildings and equipment, and represent the loss or reduction in their value, over their lifetime. Vehicle depreciation is a common expense of this nature. As long as the method chosen to calculate the depreciation is credible and reasonable, it is accepted as an operating expense.\nThe purchase of inventory is a capital expenditure and not an operating expense. An inventory is goods held for sale or lease, raw materials, work in progress, or materials consumed in a business. In accounting inventory, it can also refer to the segment of financial statements reflecting the value of the business' raw materials, work in progress, and finished goods. However, if the inventory items are sold, the original cost of purchasing the item being sold may be deducted from the sales revenue, as well as the purchase price of any item lost, stolen, damaged or destroyed.",0.99478585
363,363,363,"The money you earn from working is called earnings. This includes income from being employed by someone else or from working for yourself, like having your own business.

For example, if you have a snow clearing business that operates only in the winter, some expenses like vehicle maintenance might happen after the winter season. Even though these costs occur later, they should be linked to the winter season because they help generate income during that time.

When calculating your earnings, it's important to match your expenses accurately with the income they generated. Sometimes using annual financial statements can be better than monthly ones because they include all the costs you had throughout the year.

Your earnings for things like Employment Insurance benefits are usually calculated on a weekly basis because that's how the rules are set up. If you can't break down your income and expenses on a weekly basis, you may need to use other methods like averaging your numbers.

Self-employment on one's own account or in a partnership or co-adventure is included in the meaning of employment (EIR 35(1)(b)).\nEIR 35(10)(c) clarifies how self-employment income is calculated. Income includes the amount of the gross income from that employment, remaining after deducting the operating expenses, other than capital expenditures, incurred therein (EIR 35(10)(b) and (c)). The characterization of the expense must be based on the end product for which the expense was incurred (that is, providing a product or offering service) and not when the expense was incurred (FCA A-423-11; CUB 77802).\nIn other words, on-going operating expenses (for example, salary and rent) and job-specific operating expenses (for example, the purchase of specific materials needed to accomplish the job) are applied to the period in which the work is performed to generate revenue.\nFor example, a snow clearing business may operate during a limited yearly window, but some expenses, such as vehicle maintenance, may only occur after the season is over. Since those expenses occurred to generate income during the winter season, they should be linked to this period. \nTo calculate earnings, the method chosen should be one that most accurately matches expenses with the income that those expenses generated. In some cases, the use of annual statements may be preferable to relying on monthly statements. The former will include all actual expenditures incurred in the fiscal year (such as depreciation), and fixed costs (such as rent). \nEarnings for a particular week may be estimated by using monthly financial statements, invoices, or any other accounting documents. Adjustments may be required upon receipt of the year-end statement.\nEarnings considered for EI benefit purposes, including those arising from self-employment, are determined and allocated on a weekly basis since the week is the basic period used in the legislation. \nIf a weekly breakdown of actual gross income and operating expenses is not possible, the income may be calculated using other methods, such as averaging.\nIf gross income is known on a week-by-week basis but exact operating expenses are difficult to determine, or operating expenses vary widely week to week, income may be calculated by deducting a percentage for the operating expenses. The percentage that the operating expenses absorb of the gross income may be used if such an average is known.\nIf the exact weekly gross income cannot be determined, an average income based on the total gross earnings, after deducting operating expenses for the period in question, may be used. This method should not be used in cases where the claimant is not engaged in self-employment for a considerable time in the applicable period, unless there is no information as to when the actual work was performed (CUB 70120).\nThese methods are used when difficulties arise in determining income, and not only when it is more advantageous to a claimant whose income widely fluctuates over the period of operation (CUB 79773).",0.8820312

- An expressed deal is when both parties openly agree to specific terms either by speaking them or writing them down.
- An implied deal is one that the law considers fair based on the actions of the people involved. It can happen when one person does work without being asked to, and the other person benefits from it knowing that they would get paid. An implied deal is an agreement that can be understood from the circumstances and how things usually work.

Once you figure out if the money came from doing work or from a sale, you can then allocate that money accordingly following the rules.",74.52636824324328,8.609290540540542,10.125756701596842,11.844594594594597,11.085635135135137,9.078054054054054,40.96283783783784,4.125,0.8176338928086417,0.8551485339800516,2.761227538801068,0.40017481420552,0.4752597892303775,0.0717250000344718,4.448648648648649,4.0,2.246633712627492,23.125,24.0,9.879745695107744,1.2864864864864864,1.0,0.5780499193641017,185,111,0.6,842,8,5.16.7,Allocation of self-employment earnings,Chapter 5 - Earnings,"Once calculated, the reason the earnings were paid must be examined in order to determine the period to which they will be allocated. It must be verified whether the earnings arose from the performance of services or were paid as the result of a transaction (Digest 5.16.8; Digest 5.16.9). The type of  contractual arrangements entered into with customers or clients determines which applies. Contractual arrangements of self-employment are either service contracts or sales contracts, and these contracts may be express or implied. \nAccording to Black's Law Dictionary:\n\nAn express contract is an actual agreement of the parties, the terms of which are openly uttered or declared at the time of making it, being stated in distinct  and explicit language, either orally or in writing \nAn implied contract is inferred by the law as a matter of reason and justice, from the act or conduct of the parties. An implied contract may arise where one party, without being requested to do so, renders services under circumstances indicating that they expect to be paid thereof, and the other party knowing the circumstances, avails themselves of the benefit of those services. An implied contract is an agreement that can be legitimately inferred from the intention of the parties, as evidenced by circumstances and the ordinary course of dealing and common understanding\n\nOnce the determination is made with respect to the  nature of the agreement giving rise to the earnings (performance of services or transaction), allocation of these moneys can proceed pursuant to EIR 36.",0.6763991

For example, when a house is sold, the real estate agent earns a commission from that transaction. So, any money earned from these kinds of transactions is considered income for employment insurance benefits. 

When someone makes a sales contract, they're agreeing to hand over ownership of something once the buyer pays according to the agreed terms. This exchange of ownership is what we call a transaction.

A transaction includes the sale of many types of goods and products, including farming products (for example, crops, wood, livestock, eggs, grain, honey, fruit, vegetables, flowers, tobacco, etc.), products built from hand (for example, art, furniture, housing, clothing), but can also stem from services that may not fall as cleanly into the categories mentioned. For example, real estate commission earnings resulting from the sale of a home are transactional-based where, if not for the sale of the home, the earnings would not have been received. Thus, it is the transaction of the purchase and sale, which is considered earnings for EI benefit purposes.\nA sales contract is an agreement under which the seller agrees to convey title to property upon payment by a buyer, under terms of the contract. This conveyance constitutes a transaction. It includes both a present sale of goods, and a contract to sell goods at a future time. Self-employed persons who are engaged in selling goods or products are contracting with their customers for a product. As a result, the income is generated by a transaction.",0.9955942
369,369,369,"A transaction happens when a sale is done, the buyer buys the product, and the seller has the right to get paid. It doesn't matter if the payment is made right away or later. This applies to all self-employed businesses, like farming. The terms in the sales agreement decide when the ownership and sale are complete. A transaction can occur when a deposit is paid, the full price is paid, or when the product is delivered to the buyer. It also happens when a buyer changes their mind and gives up a deposit. 

A transaction also occurs when a seller delivers a product and gets a payment that can be cashed right away. This includes cash tickets given to farmers. A cash ticket is like cash or a check. Even if the payment is delayed, the product is considered sold and the transaction is complete because the seller no longer owns it. When a seller gives products to a company or agency, there might be a fixed price. If the final price is more than what the company paid, the seller gets the difference. The transaction is considered to happen when the product was first sold or delivered.

A transaction doesn't happen when someone delivers goods to a company or storage place without getting paid but gets a receipt instead. A receipt shows what was received for storage. It's also not counted as a transaction when a seller holds onto products waiting for a better price or when they get an advance against future sales. This advance is like a loan that has to be paid back when the product is sold. 

If a seller is paid by a company based on an estimated amount of products sold over a specific time and the exact sale dates are unknown, then the transaction is considered to happen when the payment is received.",81.10678571428575,6.294047619047618,8.515128840125781,9.031746031746032,7.864571428571427,8.156571428571425,39.40476190476191,3.8333333333333335,0.7971338208983926,0.8055886663496494,2.530936952028944,0.5120012282442025,0.4618979200275218,0.0822518858750916,4.3619047619047615,4.0,2.3975800346757428,17.5,16.0,7.690181330039551,1.276190476190476,1.0,0.5490870592533171,315,130,0.4126984126984127,1410,18,5.16.9.2,Determining when a transaction occurs,Chapter 5 - Earnings,"A transaction occurs when a sale is considered complete, that is, when the buyer purchases the product and a right to payment for that product exists. It does not matter whether the payment for the transaction is immediate or deferred. This applies to all transactions arising from self-employment, including farming transactions.\nIt is the terms of the sales contract that determines when ownership is transferred and the sales transaction is complete. A transaction may occur on payment of a deposit or the full price for the item, or only upon delivery of the product to the customer. A transaction also occurs when a customer who backs out of a deal forfeits a deposit.\nA transaction occurs when a claimant delivers a product and receives a payment that is immediately negotiable. This includes cash tickets issued to farmers. A cash ticket is a negotiable instrument and is considered the same as the receipt of cash or a cheque. A transaction occurs in the week that delivery is made, even if the claimant agrees to defer payment for the product to a later date. Although a payment may be deferred, the product is still considered sold and the transaction complete, as the product no longer belongs to the claimant.\nDeliveries made to a company, marketing-type board or agency may result in a set price for the product delivered. If the final price obtained for this product is greater than the initial price paid by the board or agency, the claimant receives the difference. In this circumstance, the transaction occurs when the initial sale or delivery is made. Any subsequent payment based on the difference in price is considered a transaction in the week that the original delivery was made and the product purchased by the marketing board.\nA transaction does not occur when a person delivers a product to a company, board, or agency for later sale, when market conditions are more favourable. It is not considered a sale or a transaction if the item is just delivered to a company, marketing board or storage agency, and no payment for the product is received, but a receipt or a storage ticket is issued instead. A storage ticket is a receipt issued to the farmer, recording the amount, type, and quantity of grain accepted for storage.\nA transaction does not occur if a claimant holds products awaiting a more favourable price, or delivers products for later sale, and receives an advance against the amount to be received when the products are finally sold (Digest 5.16.2.6). This advance is not a transaction as no sale or purchase has occurred, and may never occur. This type of payment is in the nature of a loan that the claimant must repay, using the eventual sale of the product. A loan received by a claimant is not earnings for EI benefit purposes, as it is not income arising out of employment, and must be repaid at a later date. A transaction occurs in the week of the sale of the product, if and when that sale ever occurs.\nIf the claimant receives payment from a company, marketing board or agency representing an estimate of the amount of products sold over a specific period, but the exact dates of the sales are unknown or cannot be reasonably ascertained, the transaction may be considered to occur when the payment is made.",0.9930034

375,375,375,"The Employment Insurance system is like an insurance plan for people who lose their jobs. If someone is fired or laid off from work and they didn't choose to leave on their own, they can get money from this system to help them while they look for a new job.

But, if someone quits their job without a good reason, they can't get this money. The process to decide if someone quit voluntarily is a two-step process. First, the Canada Employment Insurance Commission has to prove the person left on their own. Then, the person who quit has to show there was a good reason for leaving.

It may seem easy to tell when someone quits on their own, but sometimes it's not clear. This is why it's important to gather all the facts from both the person who quit and their employer. Everyone involved should have a chance to explain their side of the story. Each case is looked at individually and all factors are considered to make a fair decision based on the rules and laws.

Accordingly, the legislation provides for claimants to be disqualified from receiving benefits if they have voluntarily left their employment without just cause.\nThe adjudication of voluntary leaving is a two-fold process. The burden is on the Canada Employment Insurance Commission to show that the leaving was voluntary. The Commission also has the obligation to consider all possible applicable circumstances. Once the voluntary nature of the leaving has been established, the onus shifts to the claimant to demonstrate just cause for so leaving. Consequently, the adjudicator must first determine that the reason for separation was in fact voluntary leaving. Once this has been established, it must be determined if just cause is present.\nOn the surface, it would appear that voluntary leaving would be easy to identify. In most cases this is true, but situations exist where the circumstances surrounding the reason for separation may not be straightforward. For this reason, the importance of thorough fact-finding with all interested parties cannot be over-emphasized.\nThe claimant and the employer must have an equal opportunity to provide information. The information obtained from both parties will ensure that the facts of the situation on file are as comprehensive as possible. Final rebuttal must always be given to the claimant. There must be no allegations on file that have not been presented to the claimant with an opportunity for explanation or clarification.\nEach case must be adjudicated on its own merits and all circumstances relevant to the reason for separation must be considered in order to make a fair decision in accordance with the Act, Regulations and Jurisprudence.\nThis Chapter will define voluntary leaving, discuss circumstances where it is at times difficult to determine whether or not the reason for separation is one of voluntary leaving, explain the legal test for just cause, discuss the considerations that must be made and illustrate how to apply the legislation and the principles issued from jurisprudence given certain voluntary leaving circumstances.\n\n\nReport navigation\n\n\n\nPrevious part of report\n\n\n\nTable of contents\n\n\nNext part of report",0.9587248

- Section 30(2) explains how long this disqualification can last.
- Section 30(3) says that the disqualification doesn't apply retroactively. 
- Section 30(4) lets the Commission pause the disqualification if the person is eligible for special benefits.
- Section 32(1) gives the Commission the power to stop benefits if someone takes a leave of absence without a good reason.

- Section 34 lets the Commission pause stopping benefits in certain situations.
- Section 49(2) lets the Commission believe the claimant if the information from the claimant and employer is different but both seem believable.
- Section 51 says it's the Commission's job to hear from both the claimant and employer to figure out why the job was lost.

379,379,379,"Voluntarily leaving a job means that the employee chose to end their relationship with the employer, not the other way around. If you leave a job, certain rules apply. These rules apply whether your job was insurable for benefits or not. However, if you are self-employed, different rules might apply. 

Sometimes leaving a job can mean not being able to get employment benefits, especially if you left for no good reason. There are exceptions to this rule, like if you've found a new job that qualifies you for benefits or if certain parts of the law apply in your situation. 

When someone leaves their job, it's important to figure out if they had a choice or if they were forced to leave, even if it looked voluntary. For example, if things became so bad at work that they had to quit, it's called constructive dismissal. This is tricky to prove sometimes. 

To make things even more complex, there are cases where someone leaves a job temporarily, like taking a leave of absence, and fails to provide a good reason for leaving. In these cases, they could lose some benefits. 

When someone voluntarily leaves a job right before it ends or if the employer makes the job situation so impossible that quitting is the only option, it gets even more complicated.

It states:\n29. For the purposes of sections 30 to 33, \n\nemployment refers to any employment of the claimant within their qualifying period or their benefit period;\n\nTherefore, these provisions apply where a claimant leaves any employment, whether the employment is insurable or not. The only exception to this is where the non insurable employment is for employment under a contract for service which means the claimant is self-employed in the operation of a business that provides a service without setting up an employer-employee relationship.\nSubsection 29 (b.1) of the Employment Insurance Act states:\n(b.1) voluntarily leaving an employment includes\n\nthe refusal of employment offered as an alternative to an anticipated loss of employment, in which case the voluntary leaving occurs when the loss of employment occurs,\nthe refusal to resume an employment, in which case the voluntary leaving occurs when the employment is supposed to be resumed, and\nthe refusal to continue in an employment after the work, undertaking or business of the employer is transferred to another employer, in which case the voluntary leaving occurs when the work, undertaking or business is transferred;\n\nSubsection 30(1) of the Employment Insurance Act states:\nA claimant is disqualified from receiving any benefits if the claimant lost any employment because of their misconduct or voluntarily left any employment without just cause, unless\n\nthe claimant has, since losing or leaving the employment, been employed in insurable employment for the number of hours required by section 7 or 7.1 to qualify to receive benefits; or\nthe claimant is disentitled under sections 31 of the Act to 33 of the Act in relation to the employment\n\nSubsection 30(7) clarifies that any employment referred to in EIA 30(1) means that even though a claimant may not have lost or left their last employment voluntarily, they may still be disqualified due to their separation from another employment. It also stipulates that the claim need not be an initial claim for benefits.\nThe question to be asked is, Did the employee have a choice to stay or leave?    \nEven though a voluntary separation generally results in a final severance of the employment relationship, this is not always the case. A temporary separation may exist as in the case of a leave of absence taken from employment. These situations are also considered voluntary leaving but are dealt with under a different section of the Act. In situations where individuals take a leave of absence from a job but fail to prove they had just cause for so doing, they would be subject to a disentitlement pursuant to section 32 of the Act.\nAdditionally, voluntary leaving that occurs within 3 weeks of the employment's scheduled end date is dealt with under section 33 of the Act    .\nWhen dealing with the issue of voluntary leaving, one must distinguish whether the employee truly left their employment voluntarily or whether instead the separation was a form of veiled dismissal. This is called constructive dismissal.\nHow can one determine whether a loss of employment amounts to constructive dismissal? The phrase constructive dismissal refers to situations where the employer has not directly fired the employee. This question can be one of the more difficult ones to recognize when looking at the reasons for separation. It may look at first glance like the claimant quit their employment but upon further fact finding the information shows that rather than fire the employee, the employer made the situation so intolerable that the claimant had no alternative but to quit   .\nWhether or not the separation is voluntary can often be a complex issue with some cases being more straightforward than others. Circumstances may exist at times which make it difficult to conclude whether or not the case is one of voluntary leaving.

380,380,380,"Sometimes it can be hard to tell if someone lost their job because of something they did wrong or if they chose to leave on their own. Even though these two ideas seem different, they are both looked at in the same way under the law. In both cases, the person did something that led to them losing their job. These two ideas are connected because they both involve situations where the job loss came from something the employee did on purpose.

It can be tricky to figure out if someone lost their job because of their own actions or because they chose to leave. If someone is not sure, the decision can be based on both reasons as long as there is evidence to support it. This doesn't harm the person making the claim.

Sometimes, the situation can get even more complicated. For example, if someone leaves their job because they did something wrong, like losing their driver's license, or if they quit after being sent to prison and don't want to be fired. 

It's not enough for someone to just say the job loss was the person's fault â€“ the authorities need to gather all the facts and think about why the person left their job.

In each case, the claimant has acted in such a manner that loss of employment resulted. These two notions are rationally linked together because they both refer to situations where loss of employment results from a deliberate action of the employee. The two notions have also been linked for very practical reasons: it is often unclear from the contradictory evidence, especially for the Commission, whether the unemployment results from the employee's own misconduct or from the employee's decision to leave voluntarily. In the end, since the legal issue is a disqualification under subsection 30(1) of the Act, the finding can be based on either or both of the two grounds for disqualification as long as it is supported by the evidence. There is no prejudice to a claimant in so doing   .\nThese notions may also become a mixed issue in specific circumstances where the voluntary leaving is the result of misconduct when, for instance, following the loss of their driver's licence, a claimant left rather than being laid off or when a claimant quit their job after being sentenced to a federal penitentiary and did not want to advise their employer of the situation because they preferred not to be fired   .\nThis does not mean the adjudicator may simply determine the loss of employment somehow resulted from the claimant's own actions. The Commission must gather and evaluate the facts. The final decision must reflect the facts considered and why a determination of dismissal due to misconduct, or voluntary separation without just cause, is more valid.

If an employer is reducing their workforce, an employee can decide to leave their job on their own, which could help save a coworker's job. More information about how workforce reductions work will be explained later in the chapter.

The argument that one employee had to be laid off in any event and that the Commission should not concern itself with identifying which employee was to have been laid off does not alter the voluntary nature of the separation.\nHowever, under an employer's work force reduction process, an employee could voluntarily leave their employment thereby preserving the employment of a co-worker.

Although a recall must exist at the time of the lay-off, it does not have to be a known recall date. Nonetheless, there must be a notion that the claimant knew that they were to be recalled. This knowledge may be through an actual recall date, by seniority rights, by custom for seasonal or temporary workers, or even by a verbal arrangement with the employer. In conclusion, there must be some plan, understanding or arrangement whereby the claimant's employment is to restart some time in the future. Furthermore, the job that is available when recalled does not have to be the exact same duties, position or job.\nA person, who is temporarily suspended from duty as a disciplinary action, may decide to make the separation final and refuse to resume their employment. Their failure to resume their employment at the conclusion of the period of suspension is considered to be voluntary leaving   .\nAdditionally, in a situation where the claimant will not continue in an employment after the work, undertaking or business of the employer is transferred to another employer and the new employer has offered employment with no break in service, the voluntary separation will be considered to have occurred at the point where the work or business of the employer is transferred. This could apply to cases where the company is privatized or merged with another but the employment continues within the private or merged company. It does not matter whether or not the actual work was the same.",0.9929635

This applies whether you could have stayed at the same place or moved to a different location for work. Saying that someone else could have been let go instead of you doesn't matter. Seniority rights exist so that employees who have worked longer can keep their jobs over newer workers.

Sometimes, a work agreement might have a rule where those who have been there longer could be laid off first. If this happens, those employees who could have kept their job by asking or using their rights will be seen as leaving the job on their own.",82.19500000000002,6.763333333333335,9.2995712137729,10.333333333333334,8.823,8.003999999999998,33.333333333333336,2.6666666666666665,0.8364792943000794,0.8418767601251602,3.244696511393426,0.3928060447324292,0.380365703312618,0.0464554840940868,4.3,4.0,1.943364779619788,20.0,19.5,3.958114029012639,1.2333333333333334,1.0,0.5436502143433363,120,78,0.65,528,6,6.3.7,Seniority rights not exercised,Chapter 6 - Voluntarily leaving employment,Failure to exercise seniority rights which would enable a person to continue in employment generally amounts to voluntarily leaving employment. This is true whether the employment was to continue without interruption on the same premises or at different premises.\nA contention that another employee would have been released is without merit. The very purpose of seniority rights is precisely to give employees with longer service the right to replace junior employees.\nIt happens sometimes that a labour agreement contains an inverse seniority clause under which employees with longer service can be laid off first. It will be considered that the separation is voluntary for those employees who could have remained employed had they requested it or exercised their rights.,0.9979809
392,392,392,"Sometimes, employers and employees can agree to temporarily set aside seniority rights during layoff times. This means skilled and experienced workers won't be replaced by less effective senior employees from another department just because they have more years of service. By doing this, businesses are able to keep running smoothly and stay competitive.

However, if employees agree to this temporary change, certain conditions must be met to make sure it's considered a layoff and not employees leaving voluntarily. These conditions are: the agreement must be temporary, all employees protected by seniority rules must agree to it, the agreement can't single out specific individuals, layoffs must be based on business needs and not personal choice, the agreement doesn't replace the original contract but just puts seniority rights on hold temporarily, and the agreement must be legitimate and not meant to bypass the rules or favor certain individuals.

Employers can't just decide to extend this agreement on their own; both parties need to agree if more time is needed.

Such agreements avoid temporarily replacing staff who are skilled and experienced in a given sector of the business with employees from another sector selected solely on the basis of their seniority, but who may be less effective and may have to be trained. This allows employers to continue business activities in a viable and competitive way.\nNot exercising seniority rights under normal circumstances constitutes voluntary leaving. However, if the loss of employment is as a result of an agreement between the employer and the representatives of their employees to temporarily suspend seniority rights, and all the conditions described below are present, then the loss of employment will be deemed a layoff.\n\nThe agreement between the parties to temporarily waive seniority rights of employees of a sector of activities must be for a limited period, applicable only during temporary lay offs; and\nApproval of all the employees protected by the seniority clause - not only those subject to the lay-off - is required before their representatives may negotiate with the employer; and\nNeither the approval nor the agreement itself can refer to specified or named individuals. It is sectors of activities that are affected by the agreement, not individuals; and\nOnce the seniority rights are suspended, it is essential that the lay-offs be determined by the business needs and that the individuals have no personal choice to be laid-off or not; and\nThese agreements or letters of agreement are not replacing the collective agreement in effect, but rather, are only temporarily suspending the provisions of the collective agreement dealing with seniority rights; and\nThese must be documented, bona fide agreements, which are not made to circumvent the  EI  Act or to give advantages to certain individuals.\n\nThese agreements cannot be unilaterally extended by the employer. If it becomes necessary to extend the provisions, a new agreement must be re-negotiated between the parties.\nThis situation must not be mistaken with that outlined in Section 51 of the Employment Insurance Regulations (EIR) (work force reduction) which applies to situations in which claimants have voluntarily left their employment and where there have been measures taken to permanently reduce the employer's work force and to protect the jobs of other workers   .",0.99897635

394,394,394,"Leaving a job after being told to leave by the employer, especially after threatening to quit, is considered as leaving the job on your own. Similarly, telling your employer to change something at work or else you'll quit, and then getting fired, is also seen as leaving voluntarily. Sometimes, employees might have to choose between getting fired or following a rule set by the employer. Even if it seems like getting fired, it's still seen as the employee's choice because they chose the option that led to getting fired.

This also applies when an employee chooses to get fired instead of doing things like getting a medical check-up, joining a medical plan, paying union fees, working different hours, or dropping complaints against the employer. It also applies in cases like refusing to follow dress codes, work extra hours, obey an order, or take time off without permission.

However, if someone resigns to avoid getting fired, it's seen as a misconduct issue rather than leaving voluntarily. In these cases, the person might have been fired anyway, but they want to make it look like they quit instead of being fired. It's important to figure out the real reason for leaving and handle it correctly.

Sometimes it's not clear whether someone actually left on their own or if it was a way for the employer to push them out. If there are signs that the employer was trying to get rid of a specific person for some reason, it might be seen as a constructive dismissal.",66.62165961945033,9.793706835799856,11.741389052700956,13.257787174066245,11.839133192389006,9.831007751937983,47.09795630725863,5.545454545454546,0.8929351389408111,0.8907102942466736,3.071714733967129,0.605016574016294,0.4246242927808772,0.0499423724631135,4.573643410852713,4.0,2.3666782196413605,23.454545454545453,24.0,5.382862306577258,1.375968992248062,1.0,0.6778071338267445,258,142,0.5503875968992248,1224,11,6.3.9,Threat of resignation or of dismissal,Chapter 6 - Voluntarily leaving employment,"Separating from employment upon an employer's invitation to do so, after having first threatened to leave, constitutes voluntarily leaving employment. Likewise, a statement made to an employer as an ultimatum that if working conditions are not changed one would cease their employment, amounts to voluntarily leaving if it results in the termination of the employment   .\nCases may arise where an employee is faced with making a choice between being dismissed or complying with an employer's rule. Such an apparent dismissal is but a voluntary separation in disguise, since the employee's decision to choose the option leading to dismissal is one made on one's own.\nThis applies in cases where the employee chooses to be dismissed rather than undergo a medical examination, subscribe to a group medical plan, pay union dues, accept a change in working hours or rather than withdraw accusations against the employer. The principle also applies in the following cases which could be subjected to the misconduct provision: the refusal to wear a tie or a cap, to work overtime, to obey an order or to forego an unauthorized leave of absence.\nOn the other hand, when resignation is submitted as the only alternative to dismissal, the question is one of misconduct rather than voluntary separation. In such cases it may be that an individual's employment would be terminated anyway, but they wish to show quit instead of fired on their record. The true reason for separation must be clarified and adjudicated accordingly.\nIt is uncertain in some instances whether a person in fact leaves voluntarily or whether it is actually a constructive dismissal when there are many indications that all the employer was trying to do was get rid of a particular person for one reason or another   .",0.98265356

404,404,404,"The rule of no reasonable alternative in the law comes from the idea behind the employment insurance system, which aims to help people who lose their jobs involuntarily. If someone quits their job and wants to get benefits, they have to prove that leaving was their only good choice.

What counts as a reasonable alternative can vary depending on the situation. The law doesn't expect people to do the impossible to show a good reason for leaving; it just asks for what's sensible given the circumstances. To determine if someone had a good reason for quitting, these things need to be figured out:

1. What caused the person to leave on their own
2. If there were other ways to fix the situation that were reasonable and if they were tried
3. Why the person didn't use those solutions that seemed reasonable and available

Some situations leave only a few options, like when someone is being mistreated at a small company, or when a workplace is hostile toward them. The solution to a bad situation needs to end it quickly to be seen as reasonable.

People who work in places without unions, have unstable jobs, or aren't full-time often have to rely on their employer when a problem comes up. If the employer doesn't help after the issue is brought up, a sensible solution for the employee might be to find a new job before quitting. But this isn't sensible if the situation is unbearable and can't be tolerated while looking for a new job.

A solution might become less sensible if it takes a long time to fix a hard situation. No one should have to deal with ongoing mistreatment from bosses or coworkers.

In general, someone shouldn't have to look for help that's hard to get at work or in their personal life, or won't fix the issue soon. Sensible options don't involve going to court.

In some cases, a good alternative might be to get help from agencies that handle laws about work conditions, worker rights, or human rights. But the solution needs to make sense and be able to fix the problem within a reasonable time.

Lastly, someone might have valid reasons for not using a sensible solution that seemed obvious, like if the situation was really upsetting and all they could think about was getting away fast. For example, someone shouldn't have to stay in a job where they're in danger or feel they could be judged or face bad consequences from coworkers.

So, when it comes to leaving a job and asking for benefits, the law expects people to have a solid reason for quitting, but it understands that not all situations have a clear answer.",74.46479885057472,8.362056650246306,9.957137785484202,11.424302134646965,10.26447249589491,8.636034482758621,40.845238095238095,4.142857142857143,0.844381982088089,0.8526950290328578,2.672709341838136,0.620824154173047,0.4603061360567681,0.0644727653629325,4.383620689655173,4.0,2.4431975926668965,22.09523809523809,22.0,7.508121075619905,1.299568965517241,1.0,0.6217326904282947,464,210,0.4525862068965517,2114,21,6.4.2,A crucial test: no reasonable alternative but to leave,Chapter 6 - Voluntarily leaving employment,"The test of no reasonable alternative in the legislation stems from the philosophy of the employment insurance system which is aimed primarily at protecting insured persons in situations of involuntary unemployment. A claimant who voluntarily leaves employment and wishes to receive benefits must therefore show that leaving was the only reasonable alternative under the circumstances.\nThe definition of reasonable alternative can certainly vary from one case to another. The legislation does not ask claimants to do the impossible in establishing just cause for voluntarily leaving; all it requires is what is reasonable under the circumstances. What is required is:\n\na determination of what the situation was that led to the voluntary separation;\nwhether other measures or reasonable alternatives which could have remedied this situation existed and/or were exercised; and\nthe claimant's reasons for not using what appear to be reasonable solutions which were available.\n\nSome situations can have only a few outcomes, as in the case of a person who is being harassed by the owner of the small private company for which he or she works, or the person who is employed in a workplace where the general atmosphere is hostile and malicious toward that person. The solution to an intolerable or unacceptable situation must be one which puts an end to the situation very quickly; otherwise, the solution cannot be considered reasonable.\nPersons working in a non-unionized workplace, who are not permanently employed, or whose employment is precarious, are very often at the mercy of the employer when a problem arises that requires a relatively quick resolution. If, after the employee discusses the problem with the employer there is no expressed interest in helping to remedy the situation, a reasonable alternative for the employee could be to secure other employment before leaving. This alternative would not be reasonable, however, if the situation in the workplace were totally unacceptable and could not be tolerated while the person looked for other employment.\nA possible solution may gradually become less reasonable the longer it takes to remedy a situation that, while not intolerable, is difficult. No one should endure a difficult situation that seems to have no end or clearly will not be resolved within an acceptable period. A person does not, for example, have to put up with constant harassment from superiors or co-workers.\nGenerally speaking, a person should not be required to take recourse that is not immediately accessible in their work environment or personal life, or is unlikely to remedy the situation within a reasonable period of time. A reasonable alternative does not include recourse that might be taken through civil or criminal court action.\nA reasonable alternative can in some circumstances include using agencies responsible for enforcing legislation or regulations governing labour standards, occupational safety and health, labour rights or human rights. Again, the recourse must be one that can reasonably be used and can remedy, within a reasonable time frame, a situation that might be tolerable until an investigation is conducted or a complaint or grievance is heard.\nFinally, a claimant may be able to cite valid grounds for not having used an alternative that at first seems reasonable, as in the case where the situation was so traumatic that all the person could think of was getting away from his or her workplace as quickly as possible. For example, a claimant is not expected to remain in a work situation in which there is a real and imminent danger of injury or death.\nThe same may hold true in cases where a person is genuinely afraid of being judged by co-workers or of suffering the consequences that a complaint would have on their career because they have absolutely no faith in the remedy available or doubt that the remedy could change the situation for the better within a reasonable period.",0.98325527
405,405,405,"Reasonable alternatives can change based on whether a problem comes from the workplace or the employee's personal life. If the issue is due to relationships with colleagues, working conditions, or interactions with co-workers, the expectation is that the person with insurance will try these alternatives before quitting: talking to their employer or union, using the employment contract or agreement, asking for a different job or boss, or utilizing labor laws and regulations. If a person left their job because these options didnâ€™t help, they must prove leaving was the only reasonable choice.

Personal problems like wanting to take classes or moving can also affect work. Normally, an employee's personal choices shouldnâ€™t hurt their job. It's tough for someone to prove they had no other choice but to leave because of a personal choice. For instance, quitting to study usually isn't sufficient reason to leave a job according to insurance laws.

If events outside an employee's control affect their job, they should try reasonable solutions before quitting, such as changing schedules, finding temporary solutions, or seeking help with childcare. Just because a person has good reasons to quit doesn't mean itâ€™s considered just cause. Leaving a job for personal reasons like being unhappy with pay or wanting to study usually doesn't count as just cause. But personal situations beyond an employee's control could be seen as a justifiable reason to quit if all other options have been exhausted.",55.597912457912486,10.992532734754956,12.563389971838223,13.774635241301908,13.320516273849606,12.453662551440328,52.95510662177328,6.818181818181818,0.8597899556159974,0.8604944282107883,2.6568061843669257,0.4243088819186498,0.4571281854689783,0.0709835984052652,5.032921810699588,4.0,2.6726296182207814,22.09090909090909,19.0,11.397404373201864,1.522633744855967,1.0,0.7820662576081826,243,136,0.5596707818930041,1268,11,6.4.3,When all reasonable alternatives have been exhausted,Chapter 6 - Voluntarily leaving employment,"Reasonable alternatives vary depending on whether the problem arises from the work environment or the employee's personal life. When the problem is caused by staff relations, working conditions or relations with co-workers, for example, it is generally expected that the insured person will not spontaneously quit their job before using any reasonable alternatives that would remedy the situation.\nDepending on the circumstances, these reasonable alternatives could include:\n\ndiscussing the situation with the employer or the union and requesting redress or adjustments;\nusing the collective agreement or employment contract;\nrequesting a transfer to other duties, another division, or working under someone else's supervision;\nusing the labour standards, occupational safety and health, labour rights or human rights legislation or regulations.\n\nIf a person claims to have left their employment because the available reasonable alternatives did not lead to a satisfactory solution, it is up to the claimant to show that the option of remaining in the job was not a reasonable alternative in view of all the circumstances and that ultimately the decision to leave was the only reasonable alternative they had left.\nProblems, constraints and decisions related to the employee's personal life can also have an impact on their job. These may be the product of personal choices made by the employee, such as a desire to take courses on their own initiative or to change their place of residence. Problems may also be dictated or imposed by events, such as illness in the family or no longer having a caregiver for a child.\nIt is generally expected that personal choices made by an employee will not compromise their employment. It may be difficult for a person who voluntarily leaves employment because of circumstances resulting from a personal choice to be able to fulfill the legislative test of no reasonable alternative.\nFor example, where a claimant has voluntarily left employment to attend a course, the Court has long held that this action does not prove just cause. Although it goes without saying that in most cases claimants who choose to attend courses do so for excellent personal reasons, these reasons however do not constitute just cause for leaving an employment within the meaning of sections 29 of the EI Act\n and 30 of the EI Act.\nThe case law has consistently held that leaving one's employment in order to return to school or attend courses is contrary to the very principles underlying the unemployment insurance system for that employee to be able to impose the economic burden of their decision on contributors to the fund.\nHowever, claimants who leave an employment to take a course on the recommendation of an authority designated by the Commission, or provinces/territories who have entered into a Labour Market Development Agreement with the Government of Canada, are considered to have just cause for leaving that employment provided he or she leaves within a reasonable period.\nAnother example of the impact of a personal choice might be an insured person who wants to live out in the countryside and resigns because of difficulty in finding adequate transportation to get to work. A reasonable alternative in that instance would be not making the deliberate personal choice that leads the person to voluntarily quit their job.\nWhen the circumstances do not result from a personal choice but are dictated or imposed by events, the person is expected to use the reasonable alternatives available to remedy the circumstances so that they can continue in their employment.\nDepending on the circumstances, reasonable alternatives could include:\n\nrequesting a change of work schedule or work days;\nliving closer to the workplace for the amount of time required to find another mode of transportation or to find a solution at work or among acquaintances;\nremaining in the place of residence while the spouse is temporarily absent from the region;\nseeking a solution to child care among family or acquaintances;\nrequesting leave until an adequate solution is found.\n\nIt should be noted that the test for no reasonable alternative should not be confused with whether a claimant acted reasonably in leaving their employment. Good cause is not synonymous with just cause.\nTherefore, although a claimant may have good reason for leaving their employment, this may not be sufficient to establish just cause. Personal choices do not provide a claimant with just cause for leaving employment. Accordingly, reasons such as dissatisfaction with remuneration or leaving one's employment to return to school or to find a better job may qualify as good reasons for voluntarily leaving, but they do not constitute just cause. However, personal circumstances over which a claimant has no control may be considered just cause for voluntary separation when the claimant has exhausted any reasonable alternative before quitting.",0.99453604
406,406,406,"The process of gathering information and understanding why someone chose to leave their job on their own is very important. When it comes to unemployment benefits, it's crucial that everyone involved - the person who left the job, their employer, and the Commission in charge of benefits - all understand their roles and responsibilities.

If someone decides to quit their job and wants to claim unemployment benefits, they need to explain why they left and show that it was for a good reason according to the law. They are in the best position to describe what happened leading up to their decision. On the other hand, the employer needs to provide details to the Commission, especially if the job environment played a role in the person leaving.

The Commission's job is to make sure everyone gives the necessary information for making a decision quickly and fairly, following the rules. They have to be impartial and respectful to both the person claiming benefits and their employer. In cases involving serious issues like harassment or threats, the Commission will ensure the person has a comfortable environment to share their story.

The point of gathering all this information is to understand what happened accurately before making a decision. The Commission will only gather what's needed and will listen carefully and quietly.

In this regard, the Commission shall, as specified by section 51 of the EI Act\n:\n\ngive the claimant and the employer an opportunity to provide information as to the reasons for the loss of employment; and\nif the information is provided, take it into account in determining the claim.\n\nIt is therefore important to clarify the roles and responsibilities of each party (claimant, employer and Commission) in the unemployment insurance system.\nIt is the responsibility of the claimant who took the initiative to voluntarily leave their employment to provide reasons for their decision and to show that the decision was justified within the meaning of the Act. The claimant is in a better position than anyone else to reconstruct the circumstances in their situation. They are the ones who experienced these events and can provide information on and explanations of what happened, the approach they took and the other reasonable alternatives they might have exercised before ultimately deciding to voluntarily leave the job.\nThe employer's role is to provide the Commission with all required information on the circumstances surrounding the separation, particularly where the circumstances are related to the work environment.\nThe role of the Commission officer (adjudicator) is to enable all parties to provide the information needed to make a decision, to facilitate finalization of the claim as quickly as possible and to authorize the payment of benefits within the framework established by the legislation.\nIn seeking the facts, the adjudicator must endeavour to obtain only information that is essential in making a decision. Information gathered must be relevant to the circumstances which existed at the time the claimant left their employment. The established principles of fairness and natural justice must at all times be respected by giving both the claimant and the employer the opportunity to give their account of the facts without deeming either version to be more valid than the other before all facts are gathered. As well, in the process of seeking the facts, the final rebuttal must always go to the claimant.\nThe adjudicator must remain neutral and objective, exercise judgment and common sense and not take an attitude that could imply that they are biased or are judging the actions or behaviour of any of the parties. The adjudicator must be able to listen and be discreet in handling the claimant's problems.\nIn conducting the search for the facts, the adjudicator must adapt to the specific circumstances of the case. For example, where there are indications that a claimant left their employment because of sexual harassment or to protect themselves from threats or violence from a spouse or partner, the claimant should be offered the opportunity to speak to an officer of the same gender in a more private environment in order to obtain the information needed for processing the claim.\nIn conducting fact finding on cases where sexual harassment is being alleged, the adjudicator must not expect a claimant to openly discuss the events that took place, to have kept a record of the steps taken to remedy the situation or to have taken an entirely rational approach.\nThe adjudicator must endeavour to obtain only the basic information the claimant agrees to provide and must, of course, be discreet and considerate. In some cases, the adjudicator may consider gathering testimony from other persons who, in the claimant's opinion, are familiar with the situation. Every effort must be made to deal with the claimant in a compassionate, credible and reassuring manner.\nIn these types of cases the adjudicator will ask the employer to provide the required information on the reason for separation. The officer will simply take the employer's version, and at no time at this stage in the gathering of facts will they reveal to the employer the account given by the claimant unless they agree to such disclosure or the employer mentions those details specifically.",0.9932462

In these cases, it's important for the adjudicator to determine what is true, reasonable, and makes sense based on the facts. Statements from people who saw what happened are more reliable than rumors, especially if the person is neutral.

Usually, a person's first statement is more accurate than later ones. The claimant's words might be more believable than the employer's because the employer might have reasons to hide the truth. The adjudicator looks at all the information and decides what is most likely to be true, even if there are different believable stories.

If the claimant says they were mistreated at work, that story is given more weight even if the employer tells a different story. The adjudicator must decide which version seems most believable. If the claimantâ€™s story is more believable, it doesnâ€™t automatically mean they had a good reason to quit their job. The decision is based on all the circumstances.",64.143737913486,8.651770992366412,11.979248473330829,12.482849872773537,10.152226463104329,11.030076335877862,43.03918575063613,4.466666666666667,0.8127464652061462,0.8487993753873385,2.607054373967417,0.6641445227099703,0.4863751642882078,0.0617845463388678,4.851145038167939,4.0,2.75957365918916,17.466666666666665,19.0,8.065289138579528,1.4770992366412214,1.0,0.8981800840780939,262,134,0.5114503816793893,1316,15,6.4.5,Benefit of the doubt,Chapter 6 - Voluntarily leaving employment,"The legislation authorizes the payment of benefits within a framework established by the Act, Regulations and jurisprudence. This responsibility to determine entitlement to benefits is delegated to the adjudicator.\nThe adjudicator's decision is not arbitrary and must at no time be based on assumptions or vague allegations. In order to be able to determine entitlement, the adjudicator must follow a rigorous procedure which involves:\n\nobtaining from the claimant, the employer or other interested parties the information needed to make a decision;\nconsidering the circumstances of the case and objectively evaluating the facts without prejudice;\ndetermining the credibility of the testimony obtained where there are contradictory statements;\nmaking a decision that is:       \nbased on the preponderance of the evidence (whether the facts support one version of the events over another);\nkeeping with the principles and guidelines established in accordance with the Act, Regulations and jurisprudence.\n\n\n\nIn some situations, the information obtained from the various parties may, while not being totally opposite, vary only slightly. The evaluation of the credibility of the information and statements in such a case is particularly crucial. The adjudicator, therefore, will determine what is genuine, reasonable and plausible, based on the facts rather than simply on presumptions, suppositions or opinions.\nParticular attention should be paid to the source of the gathered information. Statements from a person who has direct knowledge of the events naturally take precedence over hearsay, especially if this is from a disinterested person.\nWithout making it a fixed or inflexible rule, it can generally be said that a claimant's first (spontaneous) statement more accurately reflects the situation than a subsequent (modified or contradictory) statement which may serve the interest of that person in order to justify their position. It could also be said that at times the first statement may not reveal what truly happened because of a fear of not being believed, of reprisals, or simply at that time the person did not know the significance of a particular event or the consequences of their statements.\nStatements from the employer are no more or less valid than those from the claimant. Rather than merely accepting the employer's statements as necessarily true, they must be objectively examined. The employer may have an interest in concealing certain situations, or providing reasons that will not result in criticism, complaints or charges against the employer. It may also be the case that the employer was not aware of what actually occurred or the real reasons for the voluntary leaving.\nThe adjudicator cannot expect that an employer will at any time openly admit, for example, that a person voluntarily left their employment because they were being harassed or being discriminated against, there existed a poisoned work environment or even that there was pressure on the person to quit.\nAfter gathering and evaluating the available information, the adjudicator will decide in favour of the facts which, taking into consideration all the circumstances, are more credible. In some cases, the accounts given by the parties will be equally credible. When the officer is faced with equally credible versions of the facts and cannot decide in favour of one version over the other, then the benefit of the doubt in such a case will be given to the claimant.\nThe officer will accept at face value the statements of the claimant who states that he or she was a victim of sexual harassment or discrimination at the work place, and will give preference to this version of the facts even in the presence of another, also credible, version provided by the employer.\nThe benefit of the doubt is not given merely because there are contradictory versions of the facts present. The adjudicator must first determine which version is more credible.\nWhen the claimant's version is more credible than the employer's, it does not necessarily mean that the claimant has shown that there was just cause for the voluntary leaving. This conclusion would result when, taking into account the circumstances, there was no reasonable alternative for the claimant but to leave employment.",0.97152454

If someone quits for a reason not on the list, they can still argue they had a good reason to leave. The law says that if, considering everything, the person had no other choice but to leave, then they had a good reason. 

This law allows for a flexible review of each case to decide if someone had a valid reason to quit. The legislator wanted to ensure that the decision-maker considers all the goals of the law. The law also mentions that there could be other valid reasons not listed.

410,410,410,"Harassment is when someone acts in a way that is offensive and unacceptable towards another person, making them feel humiliated or embarrassed. This can come from one person or a group, like managers or coworkers, and can create a negative and uncomfortable environment.

This behavior can involve things like making threats, using power in harmful ways, or forcing someone to do things they don't want to do. It doesn't matter if it's sexual or not, any form of harassment is wrong and harmful. Victims of harassment, especially sexual harassment, often suffer in silence because they're afraid of speaking up or worried about what others might think.

This kind of mistreatment doesn't just happen at work â€“ it can also occur outside of work, like in a relationship. Domestic violence, especially against women, is a serious issue that can cause harm, both physically and emotionally. It's important for victims to take steps to protect themselves, even if that means leaving their job or seeking help.

If someone is being harassed, they might try to avoid the person causing the harm, request to change their work situation, or even quit their job. It's important to understand that victims of harassment may behave in ways that seem confusing to others, but it's because they're dealing with a lot of emotional distress.

It's not fair to judge someone for leaving their job because of harassment, especially if the situation was unbearable and there were no other solutions available. If the company had ways to help resolve the issue, the victim should be asked why they didn't use those options. But ultimately, it's crucial to prioritize the well-being and safety of the person facing harassment.",59.54847778981585,10.380704225352115,12.367839424501923,13.527193932827736,12.130929035752978,11.106338028169011,48.2546045503792,5.769230769230769,0.8767077823479971,0.8612649494951422,3.0637549874061025,0.5420747576570165,0.4443221585716514,0.0661729476831603,4.806338028169014,4.0,2.643320436116378,21.846153846153847,22.0,3.839995069030365,1.4788732394366195,1.0,0.7665388633345227,284,156,0.5492957746478874,1430,13,6.5.2,Sexual or other harassment,Chapter 6 - Voluntarily leaving employment,"Harassment is generally defined as any improper behaviour by a person that is directed at and offensive to another person and which the first person knew or ought reasonably to have known would be unwelcome. Harassment may take the form of reprehensible comments, actions or displays which humiliate degrade or embarrass another person. Harassment may come from an individual or a group of persons, managers or employees, creating a hostile and poisoned work environment that quickly becomes intolerable\n\n\n.\nHarassment also includes abuse of power through the injurious exercise of authority for the purpose of compromising a person's employment, damaging performance at work, endangering means of subsistence or interfering with that person's career in any other way. Acts such as intimidation, threats, blackmail and coercion also constitute a form of harassment.\nWhether sexual or non-sexual in nature or committed once or many times, harassment is reprehensible and cannot be tolerated. Sexual harassment in particular is a major problem in many workplaces and is extremely traumatic, both physically and psychologically, for the victim.\nAlthough recourse is available, victims of sexual harassment do not for the most part take any action and instead suffer in silence to avoid being judged by society or out of fear that there will be reprisals or their career will be jeopardized.\nHarassment is not exclusive to the workplace and can take the form of exterior threats, abuse or violence. The victim is usually a woman and the harassment originating from the spouse or other intimate partner may even go on up to the workplace.\nViolence against women is a serious problem that causes injury, emotional trauma and even death, and inevitably affects the victim's performance at work. Victims may feel required to leave their home and even to take leave or leave their employment to escape a violent relationship, cutting off all possible contact with their aggressor to protect their safety or their life or the lives of their loved ones.\nIn general, claimants are fully justified in taking leave or leaving their employment in such circumstances of harassment, abuse and violence. It is their only reasonable alternative, especially since they tend to hide their circumstances from those around them and tolerate the situation, which deteriorates throughout their relationship with the originator of the harassment or violence until there are no other alternatives.\nA victim of harassment may react in a number of different ways that may seem illogical or unreasonable to anyone who is unfamiliar with the psychological profile of the victim and the serious trauma harassment can cause. They will generally try to avoid any contact or confrontation with the person by whom they were harassed, may request a transfer or a different work schedule, or take sick leave. Some victims even quit their jobs spontaneously to escape a situation that has become intolerable or to ensure there is no further harassment.\nThe adjudicator cannot determine whether harassment occurred by examining the behaviour of the harassment victim after the fact. As we saw in the previous section, the adjudicator has to adapt the search for the facts to the circumstances.\nThe fact that a person did not take any recourse or did not await the outcome of any remedy before voluntarily leaving their employment must not be considered against the claimant when the situation indicates intolerable harassment that could not have been resolved immediately or within a few days of the incident. However, if the company that employed the claimant had a credible, coherent and structured policy that the claimant could have used to resolve the situation immediately, the claimant must be asked to explain why they did not use that alternative, which on the surface appeared to be reasonable.\n\nInformation\nSexual or other harassment\n\nReasonable alternatives:\n\n\ndiscuss the problem with the employer;\nrequest a transfer to another division;\ncontact the union;\nuse the provisions in the collective agreement;\nnot necessary to initiate or await the outcome of legal proceedings (labour or human rights).\n\nJust cause:\n\n\nharassment intolerable for any period;\nno other reasonable alternative than to leave;\nexisting reasonable alternatives failed to remedy the situation;\nvalid grounds for not having used reasonable alternatives.",0.9802059
411,411,411,"A spouse or common-law partner may have to move to a new home for various reasons, like deciding voluntarily or if a child is sick and needs medical care. A common-law partner is someone who has lived with their partner for at least a year and shares a life together. There are certain common aspects in these relationships, like living together, sharing money and responsibilities, and raising children together.

If someone has been in a common-law relationship for less than a year and wants to leave their job to follow their partner, they may still be eligible for benefits if they have a good reason. Each case is different, and many factors are considered, like finances and how serious the relationship is.

If someone wants to move to live with their partner, they must show they had a good reason and didn't have other options, like transferring to a new job or living separately for a while. The law is flexible and considers all circumstances before deciding if leaving the job was the only reasonable choice.

Sometimes, people have to move because a spouse gets a new job or is transferred. It's important to see if there were other ways, like commuting or taking leave, to keep the job. The length of the stay in the new place is also taken into account.

If a spouse or child is sick and needs treatment, the person might need to stay in a different place temporarily. Options like commuting or taking a leave of absence are considered. It's important to carefully look at all reasons for leaving a job to move with a partner or child.

It may also be dictated by events such as the illness or serious injury of a dependent child forcing a person or family to temporarily or indefinitely relocate in order to be closer to treatment centres.\nSubsection 2.(1) of the Act defines a common-law partner as an individual who has cohabitated in a conjugal relationship for a period of one year\n\n\n.\nAlthough cases and circumstances may differ, individuals who are in a common-law relationship have certain factors in common. Some basic elements include:\n\nCommon residence\nFinancial interdependence\nSharing of responsibility in running the household\nShared use of assets (car etc.)\nShared responsibility in raising any children\n\nAbsence of these elements puts the existence of such a relationship in doubt.\nThe fact that individuals are in a common-law relationship of less than one year and do not fall within the circumstances prescribed in Regulation 51.1 will not automatically mean that they are not eligible for benefits if they leave their employment to follow their partner. All elements that prompted these individuals to leave their employment must be evaluated. The expression in the Act having regard to all the circumstances requires that all of the evidence of the case be considered.\nEach situation must be examined carefully and considerations of all kinds may apply. In addition to factors already mentioned, additional evidence could include:\n\nthe couple's financial situation (it may be too costly to maintain two households);\nthe seriousness of the relationship in cases where the persons have been living together for less than twelve months\n\n\n;\nthe permanency of a relationship when there is an impending marriage;\nevidence that the couple was in a committed relationship prior to moving;\nthe distance between the old and new places of residence as it may be such that the couple could not have maintained a commuting relationship;\nthe consequences on the couple's relationship of living in separate residences;\nefforts made to secure employment in new area of residence.\n\nOf course, this list is not exhaustive, but it does illustrate some of the issues.\nWhere a claimant failed to prove a one year common-law relationship, the Umpire allowed her claim due to the committed nature of the relationship. Conversely, in another case where a claimant relocated to commence living with her fiancÃƒÂ© with plans to marry in more than 10 months, it was found that she had not shown just cause as the marriage was not imminent and she was not relocating to accompany her spouse as they had no history of cohabitation prior to the move.\nWhen there is no evidence that cohabitation existed, however, to accept that a decision to relocate to begin cohabitation with a person with whom a romantic relationship has begun would be to unreasonably stretch the notion of an obligation to accompany a spouse\n\n\n.\nRegulation 51.1 identifies prescribed circumstances in which a claimant can be justified to accompany to another residence a person with whom they have been cohabiting for a period of less than one year. The prescribed circumstances include a conjugal relationship where one of the two individuals has had or has adopted a child during their period of cohabitation, is expecting the birth of a child, where a child has been placed with one of them during that period for the purpose of adoption or where a claimant has an obligation to care for a member of their immediate family within the meaning of Subsection 55(2) of the Regulations.\nAn obligation to accompany a spouse or common-law partner to another residence must not be confused with a simple desire to do so. A person who voluntarily leaves employment by personal choice to accompany their spouse or common-law partner to another residence when there are other reasonable alternatives or means available to remain in their employment would have difficulty showing just cause as required by the Act.\nIndividuals who are married or in a common-law relationship sometimes have to move when one of them is transferred or obtains employment in another place, requiring the other person to leave their job. In these cases, it must be determined whether the person had other reasonable alternatives, such as requesting a transfer or commuting between the new place of residence and the work site that might have made it possible for them to keep their job.\nThe length of the stay in the other place of residence is a factor to be considered in these situations when one of the spouses or common-law partner obtains temporary employment in another residential area. One alternative that seems to be reasonable is to live apart on a temporary basis, particularly if the person who relocated is able to return to the region of residence from time to time. Asking the employer for leave can also be a reasonable alternative in some instances. Such was the case where a claimant left a permanent job to accompany her spouse to a new location where the spouse had a temporary job only. It was found that the claimant did not have just cause for leaving and was held that a reasonable alternative would have been for the couple to live apart temporarily.\nA couple may also decide to change places of residence for personal reasons which are unrelated to the place of employment of the spouse or the common-law partner. The couple may wish, for example, to move to the country, into the city or to be close to family members. Whether this decision was made unilaterally by one person or was a joint decision made by the couple is of little importance. What has to be decided, once the decision to move was made, is whether the decision of one person to accompany the other was justified. In determining this, one must take into consideration all the circumstances surrounding this move and ask whether, in this specific case, leaving employment was the only reasonable alternative.\nThe Act does not require that one of the spouses or common-law partners be assured of other employment before moving. However, the circumstances surrounding the move must be examined to determine whether leaving employment was the only reasonable alternative before creating the risk of being unemployed\n\n\n. It is important to investigate if other reasonable alternatives were available to the claimant such as requesting a transfer, commuting daily or periodically, living apart on a temporary basis or requesting a leave from the employer.\nThe health of a spouse or child may make it necessary for an individual to stay in another place of residence to allow their sick family member to receive appropriate treatment. A reasonable alternative in this case may be to commute daily or periodically, depending on the distance and the anticipated length of the stay, or take a leave of absence for the duration of the treatment.\nFinally, it is important to keep an open mind when evaluating all the elements that prompted a person to leave their employment to accompany their spouse, common-law partner or child to another place of residence. The situation in which the person finds himself or herself may very well not be reflected by any of the circumstances listed in the Act. What needs to be decided is what is appropriate for that individual in their circumstances.\nThe wording of the Act is sufficiently flexible to be able to make an informed decision as to whether leaving employment was the only reasonable alternative, having regard to all the circumstances. What is involved here is a fundamental test that the person must meet, and the Act is explicit in this regard.\n\nInformation\nObligation to accompany a spouse, common-law partner or dependent child\n\nReasonable alternatives:\n\n\ncommute daily or periodically;\nlive apart on a temporary basis if situation is not permanent;\nlook for employment in the new region before leaving;\nexamine the possibility of a transfer to the employer's branch at the new residence;\nrequest leave from the employer.\n\nJust cause:\n\n\nno possibility of an immediate transfer to the employer's branch at the new residence;\nsituation not strictly temporary or short term;\ndistance too great to commute daily;\ndependent child must live elsewhere.",0.9748423
412,412,412,"The Canadian Human Rights Act protects individuals from being discriminated against based on factors like race, ethnicity, religion, age, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability, or past criminal convictions. Sexual harassment is also considered a form of discrimination under this Act.

It is important to address discrimination because it unfairly prevents individuals from advancing in their workplace. Discrimination can take many forms, like unfair treatment or hurtful actions from supervisors or colleagues, and it can have long-lasting effects on the person being discriminated against.

When someone claims they have faced discrimination at work, officials should take their claims seriously and investigate the situation thoroughly. If the person had valid reasons for not using other options to address the discrimination, their decision to leave their job should not be held against them.

Systemic discrimination can affect groups of people who are consistently denied opportunities for advancement due to factors like sexual orientation or perceived physical abilities. In such cases, using human rights legislation may be a helpful way to address the discrimination.

It is important to consider discussing the situation with the employer, seeking a transfer to a different department, reaching out to the union, or exploring options in the collective agreement before deciding to leave a job due to discrimination.

Workers should try to find a solution to dangerous situations. This could include discussing concerns with the employer, asking for an investigation, or contacting the union or safety agencies. If the situation doesn't improve, they should officially complain to the health and safety regulator.

In some jobs, there are higher risks to health and safety. However, employers should provide protective measures and equipment. Workers can't usually quit just because their job is naturally risky unless the necessary safety measures are missing. Before quitting, they should report the issue so it can be fixed.

This responsibility happens every day, whether you share it with someone else in your family or have others help you like a babysitter or daycare. It becomes more necessary when a child is very young, has a disability, or is going through a hard time. Sometimes, balancing work with taking care of a sick child or family member can be tricky. In some cases, if a child or family member is seriously ill, had an accident, or is in distress, it might be out of your control to juggle everything.

If you need to care for someone but can't work, you might need to ask for help from friends, take a break from work, hire someone to help regularly, or adjust your work schedule. But if you quit your job to take care of your child by choice, it could be harder to prove you had a good reason for leaving. If you quit your job voluntarily to look after your child and then apply for benefits, it might be tough to show that you had a proper reason for leaving.

It also discusses scenarios like leaving two jobs at the same time or leaving a permanent job for a temporary one. The text mentions a part of the law called the Employment Insurance Act which assumes three things need to be true for someone to leave their job: they must have a good chance of getting another job, actually get another job, and that job must start soon. 

If someone leaves their job for a new one but the new job gets delayed or canceled, they might be able to leave their old job as long as they were sure about the new job starting soon. It's important that the new job starts right after the old one ends, unless there's a good reason for a break like moving. Just looking for a new job or getting one after leaving doesn't prove there was a good chance of having a new job at the time of leaving.

It's okay if the new job is not a guarantee, but the person must have a real promise from the employer to be hired. Just knowing about job openings or hoping to find a job is not enough. The text also explains how a court looks at these situations and what factors they consider.

A conditional offer of employment does not constitute reasonable assurance of another employment\n\n\n.\nA person may decide to leave their current employment for other employment which they consider more suitable only to find themselves out of work because the promised employment has been delayed or even cancelled. The claimant would have just cause for leaving their employment under these circumstances only if they were reasonably assured of the other employment in the immediate future.\nThe new employment must be scheduled to begin in the immediate future, that is, in the days immediately following the voluntary leaving so that there is no break or only a short break between the two jobs\n\n\n. A longer break might be reasonable where the promised employment requires the person to move or make other arrangements. Searching for or obtaining other employment shortly after leaving employment does not in itself constitute proof that the person had reasonable assurance of employment at the time of leaving.\nThe new employment does not have to be an absolute certainty. It is important, however, that the person have a genuine promise or reasonable assurance from an employer that he or she will be hired. Simply being made aware of opportunities and being hopeful of finding other employment is not sufficient.\nThe court has confirmed and emphasized the long established principle that simply being aware of an opening does not constitute reasonable assurance of another employment in the immediate future. When fact-finding on such cases is conducted, elements which must be examined in determining whether or not the claimant's situation corresponds to that set forth in paragraph 29(c)(vi) include:\n\nfor there to be assurance, there must be a certainty, some type of guarantee. As the Act indicates reasonable assurance, absolute certainty is not required;\nfor there to be other employment, the claimant must have been in contact with the possible employer, there must have been some offer of employment and there must be some idea of hiring conditions and time frames;\nif the possibility of employment is conditional upon completion of a course, there is no reasonable assurance of another employment;\nfor the employment to be in the immediate future, it must occur in the near future. Although time limitations are not defined by the legislation, the Court has ruled in cases where the delay was eight and thirteen weeks, that this was not employment in the immediate future\n\n\n.\n\nThe fact that the promised employment did not come about or ultimately proved to be short term should not count against the person if he or she acted in good faith.

When someone is working part-time or full-time for one employer and full-time for another at the same time, and then decides to leave one job with the expectation that the full-time job will continue, it can be considered a valid reason for leaving. Full-time work usually means working 35 hours or more per week. 

Sometimes, unexpected situations occur where the full-time job ends after the decision was made to leave the part-time or full-time job, leading the person to claim unemployment benefits. In situations where someone leaves one of two part-time jobs they were doing at the same time, a careful investigation is needed to determine if leaving was the only reasonable choice. The reason for leaving could be related to better pay, more hours, better chances for career growth, or if there was a conflict between the two jobs.

The issue of voluntary leaving is applicable to the employment left voluntarily. When a claimant is working part-time or full-time for one employer and full-time for another employer concurrently, and leaves one employment with the expectation that their full-time employment will continue, then the voluntary separation from the employment they left is with just cause. Full-time employment means that the claimant works the number of hours normally worked by full-time employees in the same occupation or industry. In most cases, full-time employment is considered to be 35 hours or more per week.\nThese cases arise when the full-time employment ends unexpectedly after the decision was made to leave the other part-time or full-time  employment, giving rise to a claim for benefits. Claimants who accept part-time or full-time work in addition to already held full-time work should not be penalized for leaving the employment they accepted,  as long as they do so with the knowledge that their full-time employment will continue. The reason for separation from the employment is not determinative of the issue. It is sufficient that there is an expectation that the full-time employment will continue\n\n\n. In such cases fact-finding will be conducted with the claimant and/or employer to confirm that the claimant was not aware or expecting their full-time employment to end when they voluntarily left their other employment.\nThere may also be situations encountered where a claimant requests benefits after voluntarily leaving one of two part-time jobs which had been held concurrently. In such cases, thorough fact finding must be done to determine whether the claimant's actions were the only reasonable alternative given all the circumstances. In such scenarios, it must be determined whether the claimant left one position for the other as there was more earning potential, increased hours of work, better chances of advancement or permanent employment. Additionally, the fact finding may reveal that there was a conflict between the two jobs such as the hours, duties or violation of interest between the two employers. As with all cases of voluntary leaving, the adjudicator must consider whether the claimant's reasons amounted to just cause in making such a decision versus whether the claimant made a personal choice of one part-time position over the other thus creating an unemployment situation.",0.9955723
417,417,417,"When someone leaves a permanent job for a temporary one, it typically results in them being unemployed eventually. This is especially true if they knew beforehand that the temporary job would only last for a short time. In such cases, the person must prove that they had no better options available to them.

To understand why someone left a permanent job for a temporary one, we need to consider some reasons. These might include: the new job paid better, had better working conditions, offered opportunities for career growth, or was with a well-known employer in a field where they could find better jobs later.

For instance, if someone left a permanent job for a seasonal one with higher pay that they expected to last until December, but then got laid off in October, the timing of leaving the permanent job and the expected duration of the seasonal job are crucial in deciding if leaving was reasonable. If someone leaves a permanent job for a temporary one that will last a long time, then they may be justified in doing so.

It's important to find out how long the new job was supposed to last and if the person knew beforehand about its brief duration. If they were unaware that the job would be short-lived when they accepted it, and if they had good reasons to believe it could lead to better opportunities in the future, then their decision to leave the permanent job might be considered reasonable.

The law doesn't require people to do the impossible to prove that they had good reasons for leaving a permanent job. It just expects them to act reasonably given their circumstances.

This occurs, for example, when a person quits a full-time time or permanent job for temporary or part-time employment knowing well in advance that the new employment will only be of short duration. If the claimant entered into this new employment knowing that it would be temporary, in order to avoid disqualification they must prove that in their situation they had no other reasonable alternative.\nOnce more, the importance of fact finding is raised. This process should clarify the circumstances that led a person to leave their permanent employment for a temporary or part-time employment. Reasons may include:\n\nThe new employment was seen by the claimant as a way to get out of an employment that was poorly paid or had poor working conditions with no opportunity for promotion or a better position;\nThe new employment was more advantageous in terms of wages or working conditions when compared with the permanent or full-time employment;\nThe new employment was with a well-established and recognized employer within a field of activities that presented career opportunities, good possibilities to apply for another position once there or be extended or rehired shortly.\n\nA case of a great interest involved a claimant who quit indeterminate permanent employment in August for seasonal permanent employment at much higher wages expecting to last until December. The claimant applied for benefit when laid off in October. The Court said that in such a case the timing of the voluntary leaving and the expected duration of the seasonal employment are the most important circumstances to consider in determining whether the leaving was a reasonable alternative. Leaving to take seasonal employment when the work season is ending and with no expectation that the requalification conditions of Section 30 of the \nEI\n\n Act could be met creates an unjustified certainty of unemployment\n\n\n.\nClaimants in this situation may be justified in leaving their permanent employment if at the time of leaving there was a definite employment offer and the expected duration of the temporary employment when accepted was expected to be of a lengthy duration.\nThe recommended fact finding on this issue is to obtain from the claimant (and employer) what the expected duration of the new employment was to have been if it was not an offer of permanent employment.\nIn looking at the anticipated duration of the employment, whether the new employment's duration alone was sufficient to support the establishment of a claim could be one factor considered.\nFacts on file would have to show that at the time the claimant accepted the offer of new employment they had no advance knowledge that it would be for a short duration. When they accepted the offer of new employment, they had reasonable assurance, for example, that the new employment presented career opportunities, the possibility of a permanent position in the future, etc. The fact that the promised employment that was initially expected to be for a long duration proved to be short term due to unforeseen circumstances will not count against the person if he or she acted in good faith.\nIf the claimant accepts new employment fully aware that it would be of a short duration, then in order to avoid disqualification, they would have to prove that leaving the permanent job was the only reasonable alternative. Claimants should not deliberately place themselves in a position of possible unemployment. The adjudicator should ask if there were other underlying reasons the claimant wished to leave the first employment and if the opportunity to move to the temporary work provided an opportunity to escape an otherwise intolerable situation.\nAs mentioned previously, the legislation does not ask claimants to do the impossible in establishing just cause for voluntarily leaving. All it requires is what is reasonable under the circumstances. The particular set of circumstances in each situation must be examined in order to determine if the person made a reasonable choice to leave a permanent or full-time employment and give preference to a temporary employment.\n\nInformation\nReasonable assurance of another employment in the immediate future\n\nReasonable alternatives:\n\n\ntry to withdraw the resignation or get the old job back.\n\nJust cause:\n\n\ngenuine promise of other employment in the immediate future;\nnot obtained for reasons beyond the person's control;\nnew employment would not have created an unemployment situation (full-time vs. part-time or on-call, permanent vs. temporary);\nsearching for or obtaining new employment after leaving is not sufficient.",0.9923578
418,418,418,"A person should expect to be paid the agreed-upon wages on time. However, there are times when this doesn't happen. If an employer changes the wage terms significantly or doesn't keep a promise of a pay raise, it could be a breach of contract. If there is a formal promise of a pay raise, a person can leave their job if the promise isn't kept. This is only valid if there was a clear promise, not just a vague one.

Being unhappy with pay, wanting a promotion, or not getting a raise isn't enough reason to quit. It's better to talk to the employer and try to resolve the issue. Only if no solution is reached should a person look for another job.

If an employer reduces pay without a good reason, a person might have a reason to leave. Changing from full-time to part-time with significant hours cut could also be a valid reason to quit.

This goes against the rules in the contract you have with your job or the laws about work hours.

If you don't want to work overtime, just saying no isn't a good enough reason to quit your job. If you get fired for not working overtime, they need to check if you were really being bad at your job or if it's fair for you to be fired.

Some jobs might need you to work extra without paying you more, depending on what you do. If you choose to work extra hours on your own without being asked, you shouldn't expect to get paid for that time unless your boss agreed to it beforehand.

Such actions often violate the provisions in collective agreements or labour standards legislation.\nSimply objecting to working outside the normal schedule does not constitute just cause for voluntarily leaving employment. If a claimant is being dismissed for refusing to work overtime, the guiding question is whether the person lost their employment by reason of misconduct and should be adjudicated according to the principles in Chapter 7.\nA claimant does not have just cause for leaving employment if they frequently have to work overtime and receive leave credits in lieu of pay. In such a case it cannot be said that they have not been compensated for the hours worked.\nWhether or not there is extra pay, being required to work an excessive amount of overtime may constitute just cause for a person voluntarily leaving employment unless the overtime is required in an emergency or on a short-term basis.\nDepending on the occupation and the level of responsibility, however, a person may not receive any additional compensation for overtime hours worked. There will be situations where individuals will devote extra hours to a job on their own initiative. This is considered to be a personal choice and if such overtime is not required or approved by the employer, no compensation would be expected for these hours.\nPayment for overtime hours, at either the normal rate or a higher rate, is often provided for in the employment contract or prescribed by law.

420,420,420,"An employee can expect their employer to stick to what was originally agreed upon in their job contract. This means the employer should not make big changes to their job without talking to them first or giving them proper compensation.

When changes are made to a person's job, a few things need to be considered, such as how big the changes are, how long they will last, if they were decided by the employer alone or agreed upon by everyone involved, and if the changes affect how much the person gets paid. Basically, it needs to be figured out if the changes were unfair, abusive, or broke the terms of the job contract.

If an employer makes big changes to a person's job tasks without discussing it with them first, and it leads to a major difference in the work they do and the money they make, the person may have a good reason to quit. It's important for the person to first try to work things out with the union and check what their rights are with the employment standards board in their province.

If the employer and the person agree to new job tasks, and the person finds these new tasks hard or just doesn't like them, this doesn't give the person a good reason to quit.

In some cases, when an employer keeps increasing a person's job duties without giving them more money or respect, the person may choose to leave. This could be seen as the employer forcing the person to quit, and in that case, the person may have a good reason to leave.

Having occasional issues at work is normal but it's important to try and find common ground to avoid constant conflicts.

If these options don't work or aren't available, then it might be considered a valid reason to leave a job. No one should have to stay in a job where they feel uncomfortable or deal with ongoing conflicts.

427,427,427,"If you ask for and are given time off from work, you are considered unemployed temporarily. If the reason for your time off does not have a good cause, you might not be able to get benefits during that time. This applies for each day you are on leave.

The time you take off work could be just a few days or might be mixed in with days you work. If you choose to take time off with your employer's permission, you might be paid or not. You must agree with your employer on when you'll go back to work, but this agreement doesn't have to be made before your leave starts.

Just because your employer says it's okay for you to take time off doesn't mean that you had a good reason according to the Employment Insurance Act. The Commission will decide if your leave was the best option based on all the information. The same rules about having a good reason for leaving your job apply to these cases.

If your employer tells you to take time off (with or without pay) or it's in your work contract, it's considered a lay-off. Even if you can choose when to take this time off, it's still not considered voluntary. In these cases, you won't be disqualified from benefits.

If you ask your employer to reduce your hours and they agree, those lost workdays will be seen as leave. However, other things like interruption of earnings and availability might also be considered.

If you take time off without a good reason, you won't get benefits until you meet certain requirements outlined in the Employment Insurance Act.

a) Going back to work 
b) Losing your job or leaving it voluntarily 
c) Working enough hours to qualify for benefits without needing to start a new claim

Because the employee's actions triggered this period of unemployment, the reasons for requesting the leave of absence are subject to the same considerations as voluntarily severing the employment entirely. Because the leave of absence is a temporary situation, though, a finding of no just cause results in a disentitlement rather than a disqualification. The disentitlement applies to each day of the leave.\nThe leave may be for a few days or interspersed with employment. The claimant will be disentitled for any days that constitute a leave of absence.\nThe leave that the person took voluntarily with the employer's permission may be with or without pay. The terms of the leave must require that the person return to work on a date agreed to by the claimant and the employer, although the agreement need not be made before the leave begins.\nJust because the employer authorizes the leave, it does not mean that the claimant had just cause within the meaning of the EI Act. It is up to the Commission to determine, based on the information gathered, whether the leave was the only reasonable alternative having regard to all the circumstances. The current adjudication principles concerning a finding of just cause continue to apply to these cases.\nIf imposed by the employer or set out in the employee's contract that the claimant must take leave (without pay or with reduced pay), then this is considered to be a lay-off. Even if the claimant was able to choose the period in which such imposed leave could be taken, this would not change the fact that the leave was not taken voluntarily. In such circumstances, a disentitlement will not be imposed.\nIf the person asks the employer to reduce the employment from full-time to part-time and the employer agrees, then the employer has agreed to the claimant taking leave and thus the days of employment lost are considered as leaves of absence. In such situations however, officers must also consider other issues such as interruption of earnings and availability.\nWhen it is shown that a person has voluntarily taken a period of leave without just cause, a disentitlement will be imposed and the person will not be entitled to receive benefits until they meet one of three relief measures outlined in Section 32(2) of the EI Act.\n\na) Resumes the employment\n\nWhether or not the person returns to work is not an issue with respect to the termination of the disentitlement. It will suffice that the period of leave is over. However, if the claimant did not recommence employment, the adjudicator must consider the issue of voluntary leaving and just cause pursuant to Section 29 and 30 of the Act.\n\nb) Loses or voluntarily leaves the employment\n\nUnlike indefinite disqualifications, to lose employment in these situations does not necessarily mean that the person was dismissed. The condition to terminate the disentitlement will be met if the person is fired or quits the employment. Of course, should the person quit without just cause or be fired for misconduct, these issues must be addressed.\nMoreover, in situations of lay-offs where there is a complete and final severance of the employer/employee relationship that leaves a claimant with no possibility to resume work, a period of leave ends on the same day the employment ends. In such cases, the anticipated period of leave becomes no longer effective and consequently the disentitlement should be terminated on the last day of the final period of leave.\n\nc) After the beginning of the period of leave, accumulates with another employer the number of hours of insurable employment required by Section 7 or 7.1 to qualify to receive benefits\n\nUnlike indefinite disqualifications, the claimant is only required to meet the requalifying conditions; a new claim need not be established. If the claim is a renewal, the disentitlement is terminated at the point the VER is met. If it is an initial claim, and the VER has been met, the disentitlement is not imposed.\nIf the conditions for ending the disentitlement have not been met when the claim ends the disentitlement will be carried over to the next benefit period.\nIf the claimant decides to voluntarily quit the employment while on leave of absence, the disentitlement will be terminated on the date prior to the date the claimant decided to voluntarily leave. The officer must then adjudicate the reason for voluntarily leaving and impose an indefinite disqualification if applicable.\nAdjudicators will impose the disentitlement for each day of leave. However, if the end date of the continuous period of leave is for a future date, the officer will impose an indefinite disentitlement for control purposes, as the claimant must meet specific conditions before the disentitlement can be terminated.\n\n\n\nReport navigation\n\n\n\nPrevious part of report\n\n\n\nTable of contents\n\n\nNext part of report",0.97178054

430,430,430,"The term ""workforce reduction"" can be confusing because it's usually used in human resources and labor agreements to describe ways a company can cut down on staff, either permanently or temporarily. This term is used in a specific rule called Regulation 51. This rule says that if an employee quits their job without a good reason, they can't get unemployment benefits. 

Companies need to change with the market, so they often have procedures for hiring and firing staff. During a restructuring, both employers and employees decide who will stay, who will leave, and what benefits the departing workers will get. When some workers leave, it can help the business stay competitive. 

If a worker quits their job without a good reason, they can't get unemployment benefits. But if they agree to leave their job as part of a workforce reduction to save their colleagues' jobs, they can get benefits. They still need to meet other requirements to get those benefits. 

Regulation 51 allows companies to downsize their workforce by letting some employees go, without those who leave being those who would have been targeted for layoff based on another agreement. This helps companies stay flexible while restructuring. 

To reduce staff numbers, a company may choose attrition, where they don't replace employees who leave. But this method wouldn't qualify for benefits under Regulation 51. Other methods like reducing work hours for everyone or laying off some workers also wouldn't meet the requirements of Regulation 51. 

Just because a company is going through a workforce reduction process doesn't mean that every employee who leaves during that time can get benefits. Only those involved in the agreed-upon reduction process can qualify for benefits. Employees who leave outside of this process can't get benefits related to the workforce reduction process.",59.94289637709389,9.311745227892484,12.526319926815653,13.198597584729256,10.986756914686405,11.914304635761589,45.91040124659135,5.0,0.830380268394947,0.8292110482851665,2.570945625507141,0.6140723372129907,0.4854853223047126,0.0708263891574718,4.996688741721854,4.0,2.623755894863986,17.764705882352942,16.0,6.584557797155633,1.52317880794702,1.0,0.8285824253370252,302,149,0.4933774834437086,1565,17,6.7.2,Within a particular context,Chapter 6 - Voluntarily leaving employment,"Using the term workforce reduction in employment insurance regulations may give rise to some confusion. This term has long been used for personnel management and in collective agreements. It generally deals with a myriad of mechanisms that an employer can use to reduce staff, permanently or temporarily. The term should therefore not be viewed in its usual application but rather applied to a process of limited duration and purpose and within the specific context of Regulation 51. That regulation provides for an exception to the Act\n\n\n which disqualifies claimants who voluntarily leave their employment without just cause.\nBusinesses must constantly adapt to market forces. Employers, both large and small, have always had procedures for hiring and releasing personnel. In a restructuring context, employers and workers reach agreements as to who will stay, who will go and what special provisions will be provided to those who leave. Those who leave allow other workers to stay on and the business to be competitive.\nA person who voluntarily leaves their employment without just cause is indefinitely disqualified from receiving benefit. However, a regulatory provision\n\n\n allows workers who agree to leave their employment under a work force reduction process and preserve jobs of their co-workers, to receive unemployment insurance benefits. Of course, they must also meet the other entitlement conditions which are discussed in other chapters of the Digest.\nThe legislation requires a strictly individual approach to claimants leaving their employment. However, in the context of employer downsizing, a collective approach is acceptable in the sense that all of the workers are affected by the workforce adjustment. As such, the overall number of employees let go will not change, but those who do leave will not necessarily be those who would have been targeted for lay-off under the collective agreement, contract or some other agreement. The end result is that the Commission ends up with the same number of claimants. Whether it is a small, medium-sized or large firm, this Regulation provides firms with the flexibility needed to restructure and reduce their workforce by providing relief from disqualification for those workers who protect the employment of a co-worker under a workforce reduction process.\nAn employer may resort to attrition to reduce the payroll. Attrition will reduce the workforce by not hiring workers when someone leaves for whatever reason. This will result in a reduction of the total workforce but will not meet the requirements of Regulation 51 as lay-off of employees is not an option when we are dealing with downsizing by means of attrition. Employees who quit their employment when employers reduce their workforce through attrition do not receive the befit of the workforce reduction relief from disqualification.\nBesides attrition, an employer may take other measures, such as reducing the work week and sharing the work among all employees or proceeding unilaterally with a lay-off. Neither of these processes would meet the regulatory requirements of Regulation 51.\nThe fact that an employer has a workforce reduction process does not necessarily mean that all employees who leave their employment during this period do so in the context of this provision. Employees who are not covered by the workforce reduction process and nevertheless decide to leave employment cannot invoke the workforce reduction process to obtain relief from a disqualification under the Act\n\n\n. They have not left their employment within the framework of a workforce reduction process.",0.9925005
431,431,431,"This rule doesn't limit an employer who wants to reduce their workforce. However, employees who choose to leave their job as part of a workforce reduction that follows the rule might still qualify for benefits.

The rule is looked at in two parts:
First part:

- The employer has to start the process to reduce the workforce permanently.
- Employees must be given the choice to leave their job voluntarily.
- The employer must document the workforce reduction process.

- Employers are asked to note the details on the Record of Employment.

However, employees who voluntarily leave their employment under a workforce reduction process that meets the regulatory text\n\n\n may come within the exception and not be disqualified from benefits.\nThis regulation is analysed in two stages.\nStage one:\n\nThis initial stage applies to all workers. It involves determining whether a given employer has a workforce reduction process within the meaning of the Regulation\n\n\n.\nFact finding may be conducted first on the issue of compliance with the regulation\n\n\n. The results may be distributed to interested parties or to other Commission offices.\nA workforce reduction process, as defined in the regulatory text\n\n\n, must have the following four elements:\n\n\nThe workforce reduction process is initiated by the employer;\n\n\nThe objective of the workforce reduction process is a permanent reduction in the overall number of employees in the business;\n\n\nThe workforce reduction process offers employees the option to voluntarily leave employment;\n\n\nThe elements of the workforce reduction process are to be documented by the employer.\n\n\n\n(a) The workforce reduction process is initiated by the employer;\n\nIt is the employer who must institute a process designed to reduce the workforce. Whether it is a process affecting only a small sector of the business or involves a larger, national process is of no importance. The number of employees affected, the locations, operations and activities covered by the process; its duration; whether the process grants additional or takes away benefits provided under a collective agreement or by provincial laws, is the employer's responsibility.\nIt is not the Commission's role to approve or reject the employer's plan. The Commission confines itself to determining, in the case of a claimant who left their employment, whether the workforce reduction measures taken by the employer are consistent with the regulatory text\n\n\n.\nIt is extremely important, therefore, that the group covered by the workforce reduction process be identified. If the claimant does not fall within this group, it cannot be said that they voluntarily left employment under this process. The group may be all of the employees, or be limited to a sector, a particular group, or a work site.\n\n(b) The objective of the workforce reduction process is a permanent reduction in the overall number of employees in the business;\n\nThe process established by the employer must lead to a permanent reduction in the total number of employees. This means that at the end of the process the business will have a workforce smaller than the one existing before implementation. There are many different combinations of an employer's workforce that an employer must take into account when determining what will be the overall number that must be reduced. Thus, the overall number of employees may also include seasonal, temporary or on call employees\n\n\n.\nIn other words, even if no worker took advantage of the employer's offer, the employer would consider laying off from within all categories of workers, including seasonal, temporary or on call, or reduce the possibility or frequency of the recall of these employees, in order to reduce the workforce by the numbers initially anticipated.\nWorkforce reduction in a small business might conceivably affect as few as only one employee and, if it meets the criteria, allow a claimant who has voluntarily left employment to avoid a disqualification under the Act\n\n\n.\nFavourable economic conditions, a sudden increase in demand, access to new markets, or the marketing of new products are all factors influencing the business and future workforce levels. These factors are not relevant in determining whether the process is consistent with the Regulation. It is the situation that is prevailing at the time the company instituted the workforce reduction process that is relevant and must be considered.\nThe Regulation does not require that employees who are leaving employment permanently preserve the employment of a co-worker. It is the reduction in the employer's workforce that must be permanent; the saving of the employment of a co-worker does not have the same requirement. Workforce reduction processes that reduce the workforce to a certain level and then, after a few weeks or months, further reduce the workforce to zero, also qualify for the workforce reduction exemption. The employee who takes advantage of the workforce reduction process in this manner during the first reduction of staff is saving the employment of the co-worker who remains until closure.\n\n(c) The workforce reduction process offers employees the option to voluntarily leave employment;\n\nThe employer must offer the employees covered by the workforce reduction process the option of voluntarily leaving their employment. All employees, or a particular group of employees, are offered the option of voluntarily leaving employment in order to preserve the employment of a co-worker who would otherwise be let go. Only an employee who has voluntarily left their employment under a workforce reduction process can take advantage of the Regulation.\nEmployees who leave voluntarily to protect the employment of a co-worker may retain recall rights or some other employment fringe benefit for a period of time after their employment ceases. These recall rights may be retained, for example, in order to be entitled to the payment of severance pay or some other employment benefit. In such cases, as long as permanent workforce reduction exists and the recall rights do not alter that permanent reduction, employees who leave under the program may be covered under the Regulation, if the program meets all the other criteria.\n\n(d) The elements of the workforce reduction process are to be documented by the employer.\n\nThe employer must furnish the Commission with information indicating that this is in fact a permanent reduction in the workforce, that personnel were informed, and that the employees covered by this process were given the option of voluntarily leaving their employment.\nThis might take the form of a letter, a notice, a memorandum or some other relevant documentation. The workforce reduction process may be part of or outside of the collective agreement\n\n\n.\nHypothetical situations or vague uncorroborated statements concerning possible or potential reductions are not acceptable.\nStage two:\n\nThe second stage covers the individual claimant.\nOnce it has been decided that the employer's work force reduction process meets the conditions specified in the Regulation\n\n\n, fact-finding is required for each individual claimant. The employer's confirmation can take a number of forms. The employer and the agent responsible for conducting the fact-finding on the workforce reduction process may agree on a procedure that best fulfils the requirements of the parties and this may involve a contact person with the employer.\nTo facilitate the fact-finding, employers are informed to note the Comments block of the Record of Employment (ROE). Even though the ROE is so indicated, it must be confirmed that the employer's workforce reduction process meets the conditions of Regulation 51(2). This is usually done by the process that the Region has in place for exchange of information on workforce reduction.\nA worker voluntarily leaving employment under a work force reduction process must complete an application for benefits. The agent will then verify whether it can be concluded from the documents provided to the Commission that the claimant voluntarily left their employment under a workforce reduction process that complies with the regulatory provisions. The agent must also be able to conclude that the claimant's departure resulted in the preservation of the employment of a co-worker who would have otherwise been let go in the course of the workforce reduction process. This conclusion can only be made after confirmation by the employer.\nIt is not necessary to identify by name the co-worker who preserved their employment through the claimant's departure. However, the employer must confirm that someone would have lost their employment under this workforce reduction process and that the claimant's departure under this process resulted in the preservation of a co-worker's employment.",0.9954117

436,436,436,"Employment Insurance benefits are given to people who lose their jobs and need financial help temporarily. If someone loses their job because of something they did wrong, like bad behavior, they can't get these benefits. Misconduct means purposefully doing something wrong at work that goes against the job's rules. It doesn't matter if the misconduct happens at work or not. If it affects the job, it's still considered misconduct. Basically, misconduct is when an employee does something on purpose that hurts their ability to do their job correctly. It's not about being part of a group that did something wrong, each person is responsible for their own actions. 

To decide if someone's actions count as misconduct, courts look at the facts of the case. It's not about whether the employer was right to fire the employee, but whether the actions line up with the rules of Employment Insurance. If an employer says an employee did something wrong, the employee gets a chance to explain their side. The key is figuring out if the job loss was due to misconduct. 

In short, to decide if misconduct happened, three things are looked at: if the person lost their job because of what they did, if they did what they're accused of, and if what they did counts as misconduct. The next sections will explain more about how these decisions are made.",72.33689310689311,7.584155844155845,11.362043627235082,11.783016983016983,9.291888111888111,9.79601731601732,41.14585414585415,4.153846153846154,0.830040713151296,0.8228841694918546,2.608426793462568,0.7301249448199513,0.4784145576064201,0.0895154139819485,4.636363636363637,4.0,2.475380547467718,17.76923076923077,16.0,7.083608881982362,1.3766233766233766,1.0,0.7093493336871834,231,118,0.5108225108225108,1116,13,7.1.0,Introduction  (A mixed question of law and fact),Chapter 7 - Misconduct,"Employment Insurance benefits are  intended to provide temporary financial assistance to those who, through no  fault of their own, become unemployed. \n Under the Employment Insurance  Act a claimant who has lost their employment by reason of their own misconduct  is disqualified from receiving benefits.   Likewise, those who are suspended from employment due to misconduct are  disentitled from receiving benefits.\nA finding that misconduct led to the separation from employment  will therefore prevent a person from receiving  regular benefits for all weeks of the benefit period for which benefits would  otherwise be payable following the waiting period.\nA decision to disqualify or disentitle a claimant because of  their misconduct is only rendered after comprehensive and well-documented  fact-finding has been conducted, to fully support the decision. \n The word  misconduct is not defined in the legislation. When this word is  used in a legislative context, it is the prerogative of the courts to interpret  it. It is therefore a question of law. Over the years, jurisprudence has made a  number of clarifications to the interpretation of the word  misconduct.\n In general,  misconduct refers to ill-intentioned actions by an employee; actions that are  incompatible with the reliable and suitable carrying out of the duties for  which the employee was hired. These are actions that result in the person who  worked for an employer and committed these infractions, no longer meeting the  expressed or implicit conditions of employment or work.\n It is not  necessary that the misconduct occur during work or at the workplace or even  while carrying out duties for the employer. An offence committed outside of  work could amount to misconduct, if the infraction was such that the conditions  of employment were no longer met, and it led to the dismissal.\n While this is not  an absolute principle, it can also be said that in order to constitute  misconduct, the actions or omissions alleged must have been voluntary or  willful or of such a careless or negligent nature that one could say the  employee willfully disregarded the effects their actions would have on their  ability to fulfill the conditions of their employment.  Misconduct involves the claimant's own  behaviour, or responsibilities for which they were personally accountable.  Association with a group of individuals is not incriminating in itself, but  group misconduct does not relieve the individual of the responsibility for their  actions.\n The question of  whether or not a particular action or omission of an employee is covered by the  interpretation given to the word misconduct by the courts is a question of  fact, which will be dealt with in later sections. The legal test to determine  whether a finding of misconduct can be made is then applied to the facts of the  case.  Misconduct is thus a mixed  question of law and fact (A-64-06, A-319-14).\n It is not appropriate to question  whether the employer was right or wrong to dismiss or suspend the claimant, or  whether the alleged misconduct was sufficiently serious to justify the  employee's dismissal or suspension.  It  is the facts of an individual case which decide whether the claimant's actions  or omissions constitute misconduct under the EI Act, and whether or not the  employment was lost by reason of that misconduct(A-274-05, A-200-09, A-319-14).\nWhen the claimant denies having committed the  action or omission alleged by the employer, the Commission must obtain, from  the employer, evidence that the claimant did in fact commit the act or omission,  or evidence that the claimant admitted to it.   The claimant must then be advised of the employer's statement and  alleged reason for dismissal and be given the opportunity to rebut the evidence  provided.  Finally, the Commission will  have to demonstrate that the alleged action or omission is directly connected  to the dismissal and that it constitutes misconduct under the Act (A-636-85, A-573-04, A-473-06, A-558-12, A-198-11). \nIn summary, what must be  determined is:\n\nwhether the claimant lost their employment  because of the alleged offence (action or omission)\nwhether the claimant committed the alleged  offence; and\nwhether the alleged offence constitutes  misconduct\n\nThe sections which follow further describe the process for making  these determinations.",0.9557292

- Section 29(a) explains what counts as employment. 
- Section 30(1) says that if someone lost their job because of misconduct, they won't get benefits unless they've worked enough hours in a new job or meet certain conditions outlined in sections 31 to 33. 
- Section 30(2) describes how long the disqualification lasts. 
- Section 30(3) says the disqualification starts from the week of the misconduct. 
- Section 30(4) mentions that the disqualification can be paused if the person is eligible for special benefits like sickness or parental leave. 
- Section 31 discusses what happens if someone is suspended due to misconduct, including how long the penalty lasts. 
- Section 33 explains what happens if someone loses their job due to misconduct shortly after knowing they will lose their job. 
- Section 34 states that penalties under sections 31 to 33 can be paused if the person is eligible for special benefits. 
- Subsection 49(2) requires the Commission to favor the person applying for benefits if both sides present equally believable evidence.
- Section 51 states that the Commission must ask both the person applying for benefits and their employer for their side of the story before making a decision.",43.565000000000026,17.12,15.4700424275458,20.666666666666668,21.2565,11.781999999999996,68.75,11.5,0.8693779826164245,0.8412921875715256,3.3665861513687605,1.1227325630357412,0.5214836492010405,0.0279707716677363,4.816666666666666,4.0,2.7763385160234977,40.0,31.5,28.57154761879961,1.45,1.0,0.8401388774085706,240,123,0.5125,1194,6,7.1.1,Authority,Chapter 7 - Misconduct,"The authority related to the Commission's  treatment of misconduct is found in the EI Act.

443,443,443,"The Commission's job is to gather information to figure out if someone lost their job because of something they did wrong. They let the person who lost the job and the employer explain what happened. The goal is to make a decision fairly and quickly according to the law.

First, the person who lost the job usually tells their side of the story when they apply for benefits. Then, someone from the Commission talks to the employer to hear their side of the story. If needed, the person who lost the job can respond or clarify things. They might even talk to other people who know about the situation.

The Commission looks into each case to understand what happened. For example, if there are signs that the person lost their job due to difficult situations like harassment or violence, they will be offered help and understanding, especially if the person needs to talk to someone of the same gender.

The person who lost their job doesn't need to share more information than they're comfortable with. The Commission will ask for basic info and will be respectful. Sometimes, they might talk to others who know about the situation. They aim to be kind and professional throughout.

The Commission asks the employer for details about why the person lost their job. They consider both sides of the story without revealing one side to the other without permission.

Both the person who lost the job and the employer need to be honest and provide proof for what they're saying. If there are differences in their stories, it will be noted, and both sides get the chance to respond. The final say always goes to the person who lost their job.

The information given to the Commission is not guaranteed to be kept private. However, the person sharing the info is protected by the law. The Commission doesn't give legal advice and should only disqualify someone from benefits as a last resort if they can't get the needed information.

Decisions are made based on what seems most likely to have happened, with a focus on the credibility of the evidence.",76.35526859504134,6.708360881542699,10.33465798735191,10.456749311294766,8.216115702479335,9.117134986225892,35.23278236914601,3.090909090909091,0.8352689515976679,0.8577541500329972,2.493283381580396,0.4966634085585153,0.4777403501659794,0.04419130309,4.542699724517906,4.0,2.3949488594354618,16.5,14.5,6.740312914236117,1.3443526170798898,1.0,0.7118747275520536,363,160,0.4407713498622589,1699,22,7.2.1,Step one: Gather relevant information from various sources,Chapter 7 - Misconduct,"It is the Commission's responsibility  to gather all of the information required to determine whether or not the  claimant lost their employment by reason of their own misconduct.  In doing so, the Commission shall, as  specified in section 51 of the EI Act:\n\ngive the claimant and the employer the opportunity to provide information as to the reasons for the loss of employment\nif the information is provided, take it into account in determining the claim\n\nThe officer's role is to  gather all the relevant information so a decision can be made within the  legislative framework required without delay. This means that all interested  parties are given the opportunity to provide information on the reasons for the  separation, and to rebut the version provided by the other party, if necessary. \nThe first statement regarding the reason for separation often  comes from the claimant when providing information on their application for benefits.\nFact-finding by the  officer with the employer will then take place to obtain the employer's version  of the reason for separation.  This will  be followed with a rebuttal or clarification by the claimant, if necessary, or  even fact-finding with anyone else who may be able to shed light on the loss of  employment. Naturally, to the extent possible, the information will be sought  from those directly involved or eyewitness to the events, particularly if there  are discrepancies between versions already obtained. \nFor example the employer's bookkeeper  may have completed the ROE and be identified as the point of  contact, when in reality the bookkeeper completed the form at the direction of  the person who actually dismissed the claimant and the bookkeeper's information is  only indirect.\nThe officer will adapt their fact-finding to the specific circumstances of  the case; for example, if there are indications the dismissal was related to  trauma or incidents resulting from harassment, abuse or violence. The  Commission's policy in such a situation is to offer the claimant the  opportunity to speak to an officer of the same gender to provide the  information needed for processing the claim. \n An officer must not expect an alleged victim of violence to openly discuss  the events that took place, to have kept a record of the steps taken to remedy  the situation or to have taken an approach that lends itself to supporting a  claim for EI benefits.\n The officer will endeavour to obtain only the basic information the claimant  agrees to provide and will, of course, be discreet and considerate. In some  cases, the officer may consider gathering testimony from other persons who, in  the claimant's opinion, are familiar with the situation. Every effort must be  made to deal with the claimant in a compassionate, professional and reassuring  manner.\n The officer will ask the employer to provide required information on the  reason for separation. The officer will simply take the employer's version, and  at no time at this stage in the gathering of facts will the officer reveal to the  employer the account given by the claimant unless the claimant agrees to such  disclosure or the employer mentions the details specifically.\n Both employers and claimants alike are expected to act in good faith and submit evidence in support of their  allegations.\nThe statements of both the claimant and employer are reviewed and  compared.  Any discrepancies,  contradictions, or additional information given or required are noted. The  other party (claimant or employer) is then given the opportunity to  respond.  Final rebuttal will always be  given to the claimant.  There must be no  allegations on file that have not been presented to the claimant with an  opportunity for explanation or clarification. \nThe officer cannot guarantee confidentiality to the person providing the information. They can, however, stress that the legislation provides that any person who gives the Commission written, oral or documentary evidence required for the proper determination of the entitlement to benefits, the giving of the evidence is an occasion of qualified privilege (EIA 129).\nThe Commission must not rely on this specific provision as a means to  obtain facts. The officer must never offer advice as to whether this provision  would protect the information provided, in any specific case. If the person  providing the information wishes to seek legal counsel regarding the  applicability of this provision prior to releasing the information, a  reasonable period of time will be allowed. \nWhile a disentitlement due to lack of information  can be imposed, this should be considered only as a last resort when reasonable  attempts to obtain the relevant information have been unsuccessful. A disentitlement  must never be imposed when a claimant has acted in good faith and frankly disclosed all the information they have.  Even if the situation remains ambiguous,  whether because the employer chooses not to disclose certain facts or the  employer's version is different, the officer relies solely on the balance of  probabilities, with particular attention given to the credibility of the  evidence (Digest 7.2.3).",0.99194807
444,444,444,"To figure out if an employee was fired for a serious reason, the employer needs to tell the Commission why the employee was let go. They need to explain what the employee did wrong that led to them being fired, why they thought it was bad enough to fire them, if it broke any work rules or agreements, what proof they had to show the employee did something wrong, if the employee knew the rules beforehand, what the employee said about what happened, and if the employer knew about the problem before they fired the employee and why they waited. Crimes or work rule violations don't usually change how this information is gathered. Sometimes it's hard to get all the facts, like if there's a court case going on. The officer will ask the employer to give detailed reasons for firing the employee. Unless a court says not to, the employer should share enough information without harming legal actions against the employee. It's not always necessary to give all the details or names of witnesses. Sometimes, the employer might not have much information, especially if a problem happened outside of work. Just stating the charges without more details usually isn't enough to explain why the employee was fired. Depending on the situation, a newspaper report can be used if there's no direct information. If employers refuse to explain why they fired someone, they might end up paying the employee unemployment benefits.",63.84042625424368,9.797698981516408,12.719339214003902,13.908864579404,11.765126367408527,10.614273858921162,47.63523198792908,5.636363636363637,0.8712782859802246,0.8699729641278585,2.846337388185912,0.8530831136569018,0.4302263727809298,0.0580050663802593,4.721991701244813,4.0,2.429395912126396,21.90909090909091,16.0,17.09574399696946,1.4273858921161826,1.0,0.7756118000425748,241,125,0.5186721991701245,1176,11,7.2.1.1,Fact-finding with the employer,Chapter 7 - Misconduct,"To determine whether or not a claimant was dismissed for reasons of  misconduct, the employer is asked to provide the Commission with information  concerning the reason for the termination of employment, specifying, among  other things: \n\nwhat actions  or omissions caused the employer to dismiss the employee; (i.e. their exact  nature, context and background)\nwhy the employer felt that such actions or omissions  warranted dismissal of the employee\nwhether such action  or omission violated a provision of the contract of employment or a policy or  rule of the employer or an essential condition of the employment\nwhat information the employer relied on to conclude  that the employee committed the action  or omission in question (i.e. testimony, investigations, reports, other sources  of information)\nwhether the person in question had been previously  informed of the employer's rules, policies, requirements or expectations\nwhat reasons the claimant gave for these actions or omissions\nif the employer became aware of such action or omission some time before  dismissing the employee, and the reason for the time elapsed before the  termination of employment (details of the dates involved should be obtained)\n\nCriminal offences or  violations of employment statutes do not generally give rise to different  procedures or a different line of questioning for the fact-finding with regard  to the termination of employment. In some instances, obtaining the appropriate  information concerning a person's actions may prove difficult. The employer  may, for example, be reluctant to provide information if a Court or labour  arbitration decision is still pending. \nThe officer will make the  need for detailed information clear to the employer, particularly with regard  to the actions attributed to the claimant and in what context the incidents  occurred. Unless a Court has ordered a publication ban, the employer should be  able to divulge sufficient information without adversely affecting any action  or proceedings against the claimant. For example, it is not necessary to  provide all the details of an inquiry or the list of those named as witnesses. \nIn some instances the  information at the employer's disposal may be limited, such as when the incident  occurred outside the work place.  A mere  disclosure of the charges with no further detail does not generally provide  enough information concerning the actions or omissions attributed to the  claimant or the elements relied upon to conclude that the claimant committed  such actions or omissions (A-130-96, CUB 76247). Depending on  the circumstances, a newspaper article describing the events and the alleged  involvement of a person may constitute a valid written form of hearsay where  information or details cannot be obtained from persons with more direct  knowledge of the events. \nWhen the employer refuses to provide  information related to the reason for separation, they are advised that failure  to do so may result in the claimant receiving benefits.",0.90652865

To decide which story is more believable, evidence is usually used.

2. The behavior was done on purpose. 
3. There is a clear link between the behavior and being fired. 
4. The behavior wasn't just an excuse for getting rid of the employee.

- There was a specific incident where the employee's actions led to them being fired or suspended. 
- The behavior had a significant negative impact on the employer. 
- The behavior broke the rules of the employer-employee relationship. 
- The employee's actions were done on purpose.

Wilfulness also exists  when the action was so negligent or careless that it appears deliberate.\nWilfulness means that the evidence reasonably leads to the conclusion  the claimant knew the conduct was prohibited or neglectful, but chose to  continue the course of conduct anyway.   It does not matter whether or not the claimant meant to harm the  employer.  Intent is irrelevant in a  finding of wilfulness (A-296-03, A-51-10; CUB 55140).

454,454,454,"It needs to be proven that losing a job was directly caused by the final incident mentioned by the employer or employee. This means showing that the employee was fired because of their actions. The Commission can't say there was misconduct if the employer first gives a less severe punishment before deciding to fire the employee for the same action. For example, suspending someone for a few days in May and then firing them for the same thing in July might indicate another reason for the dismissal. If the employer didn't find out about the action until July and then promptly fired the employee, it's more likely that the firing was due to the action. A delay in firing might happen if the employee was suspended during an investigation before being dismissed.

Being fired for a reason doesn't automatically mean it was misconduct. Even if there is a clear link between an employee's action and being fired, it doesn't always mean there was misconduct involved.

Sometimes, employees might claim that an incident was just an excuse to fire them. If all the signs of misconduct are there, the employee's claim alone isn't enough to stop benefits from being denied. Employees are responsible for their behavior, and even if the employer used an incident as a reason to fire them, the Commission only determines if there was misconduct that led to the dismissal.

When it seems like the issue was minor or there's a long time between the incident and the firing, there might be other factors at play. Evidence needs to be gathered to find out the true reason for firing and to see if misconduct happened.",62.294523809523824,10.367142857142856,13.160352788161608,14.61904761904762,11.919488095238094,10.000428571428577,43.33333333333333,4.666666666666667,0.8769253113053062,0.8840032577514648,2.927485112840872,0.4938499742226213,0.4510912105911481,0.0431876344606088,4.603571428571429,4.0,2.4311934375142275,23.33333333333333,24.5,6.0736223860962,1.4285714285714286,1.0,0.7572776160399184,280,128,0.4571428571428571,1333,12,7.2.4.5,Real reason for loss of employment (causal relationship),Chapter 7 - Misconduct,"It must be shown there was a causal relationship between the loss of  employment and the final incident described by the employer and/or claimant.\n A causal relationship means the  employee was dismissed as a direct result of the alleged actions. There is a  definite connection between what the employee did, or didn't do, and the  dismissal from employment.  The  Commission cannot make a finding of misconduct if an employer imposes a milder  punishment and later decides to dismiss the employee for the same infraction (A-152-96).  For example, if the employer suspends an  employee for three days at the end of May, and then dismisses the employee for the  same act (not a subsequent repetition of the same act) on July 31, it suggests  there may be another reason for the dismissal.   It would be difficult to prove the misconduct in May caused the loss of  employment, even if all other elements required for a finding of misconduct are  present.  If the action occurred in May,  but the employer did not learn of it until July, whereupon they immediately  dismissed the employee, it is likely that the dismissal arises from the action. A  delay may occur if, prior to the dismissal, the claimant was suspended following  the incident while the employer conducted an investigation.  In such cases, despite the delay, a  determination of misconduct may be made.\n Dismissal for cause is not the same as dismissal for misconduct. In both  instances there may be a direct relationship between an action of the employee  and a dismissal from employment (A-875-96, A-1342-92).  Although the employer may be justified in  ending the employment, a simple correlation of an action and dismissal does not  in itself lead to a finding of misconduct. \n Claimants may state the employer used an incident as an  excuse to dismiss or suspend them from employment.  If all the other elements of misconduct are  present, the claimant's statement alone is not enough to prevent a refusal of  benefits.  Employees whose conduct is undesirable  are accountable for their behaviour.  The  employer may have taken advantage of the opportunity, but the Commission does  not have to consider the employer's other reasons for choosing to dismiss an  employee.  The only question is whether  there was an incident of misconduct that resulted in dismissal (A-1040-87).\nWhen the breach seems to be over a relatively small issue,  or when there is a significant lag between the alleged event and the dismissal,  there may be other matters at play.  Fact  finding must secure evidence to establish the true reason for dismissal, to determine  whether misconduct has occurred (A-385-11).",0.99773633
455,455,455,"The term misconduct is not clearly explained in the law. Courts have made some clarifications over time to help understand it better. Now, misconduct under the EI Act is seen as behavior that is intentional or careless to the point where it shows the employee didn't care about how their actions would affect their job. It needs to involve either intentional actions or actions so reckless that they are almost intentional.

Misconduct doesn't just mean not doing your job well. It's about failing in such a serious way that it could lead to getting fired. Employers might not always define misconduct the same way courts do, so it can be hard to know why someone was fired.

If an employee is fired because they couldn't do their job despite trying, it's not misconduct. Simply not being good at a job or not getting along with a boss doesn't count as misconduct. If it's clear the employee wasn't fit for the job, it doesn't mean they were being intentionally bad.

Sometimes inappropriate behavior at work comes from being bad at the job, being careless, or doing something really wrong â€“ and any of these could be reasons for getting fired. So, it's important to investigate well and apply the facts to the legal understanding of misconduct since being labeled with misconduct under the EI Act has serious consequences.

Just because someone is fired doesn't automatically mean it counts as misconduct under the EI Act. You need to be careful and make sure that denying benefits isn't solely based on the employer saying it was misconduct or just their side of the story.

Over the years jurisprudence has made a number  of clarifications to its interpretation.   As a result, its meaning under the EI  Act has evolved to be conduct which must be wilful or at least of such a  careless or negligent nature that one could say the employee wilfully  disregarded the effects their actions would have on their ability to fulfill  the conditions of their employment.  It  requires an element of wilfulness, or conduct so reckless as to approach wilfulness (A-381-85, A-1342-92, A-296-03, A-72-02, A-558-12, A-51-10). \nIn other words, to be considered misconduct under the EI Act, the actions must be intentional or negligent to the point of being deemed  a breach of an obligation arising explicitly or implicitly from the contract of  employment; otherwise there is no misconduct.\nMisconduct is not mere failure to perform an obligation  associated with the employment. It is a failure of such magnitude that the  individual responsible for the action could predict, as a normal outcome, their dismissal or suspension.\nEmployers do not necessarily share the same definition of  misconduct as that found in jurisprudence, and it is sometimes difficult to  ascertain the cause of dismissal. \nMany times, employers express that they had no alternative  but to dismiss the employee as progressive discipline failed to rectify the  behaviour, or that the degree of incompetence or negligence was so great that  immediate termination was warranted.\nSometimes an employee, despite their best efforts, is unable  to do a job and is dismissed.  This is  not considered misconduct.  A genuine  lack of skill, aptitude or ability does not suggest a deliberate action that  reflects wilful behaviour.  Likewise, a  personality conflict between an employee and a supervisor does not represent wilfulness (CUB 36177, CUB 75215).  If the evidence concludes the employee was  not suited to the job, this in itself does not imply wilfulness or misconduct.\nInappropriate behaviour in the workplace can be the result  of incompetence, negligence or misconduct, any one of which an employer could  consider grounds for dismissal. For these reasons, especially given the consequences  of a finding of misconduct under the EI Act, thorough fact-finding and the  application of these facts to the judicial interpretation of misconduct is a  necessity. \nAn employer may well have cause for dismissing an individual, but dismissal does not automatically translate into  misconduct under the EI Act.  Care must  be taken to ensure that a decision to deny benefits is not taken solely on an  employer's assurance that the conduct in question is misconduct, or exclusively  on the employer's subjective appreciation of the events (A-732-95).\nThe employer is not required to prove that the actions or omissions in question  constitute misconduct under the Act nor is the Commission to rely on the employer's belief that the actions in question constituted  misconduct.",0.9711066
456,456,456,"Sometimes it can be hard for an officer to figure out if someone lost their job by choice or if they were fired. For example, a person might decide to quit instead of getting fired so it looks better on their resume. But if someone doesn't tell their boss they won't be at work for a long time, it could seem like they wanted to get fired. The rules about quitting and getting fired are closely connected. In both cases, the person did something that led to them losing their job on their own. Whether someone got fired for doing something wrong or left on their own without a good reason, they could still be disqualified from certain benefits. The officer can't just guess why someone lost their job; they have to collect and review the facts before making a decision. The decision would consider who started the process of ending the job and why. Sometimes, even if a person's reason for leaving their job changes because of a complaint, it doesn't change what happened or why they left. In some situations like constructive dismissal, the employer might make big changes to the job that force the employee to quit.

A person having to choose between resigning  or being dismissed may decide to leave the job in order to preserve their work  record. On the other hand, a person who does not advise the employer of a  prolonged absence from work could be viewed as a person who wants to leave  employment to the point of leading to a dismissal. \nThe sections of the legislation that address voluntary  leaving and dismissal are inextricably linked.   In either case, the claimant has acted in such a manner that avoidable  loss of employment resulted. \nIt does not matter whether  the case is one of loss of employment through misconduct or voluntary  separation without just cause provided that a disqualification would be  warranted in either case. Both grounds could be mentioned in the notice of  disqualification sent to the claimant (A-1398-92, A-78-04, A-562-04). \nThis does not mean the officer may simply determine the  loss of employment somehow resulted from the claimant's own actions.   The Commission must gather and evaluate the  facts.  The final decision must reflect  the facts considered and whether a determination of dismissal due to  misconduct, or voluntary separation without just cause, is more valid.  The decision would involve who initiated the act of severing the  employment and the reasons behind this action.\nThere may be situations for which an original reason for the separation  from employment has been changed as a result of a grievance. This does not alter  the facts of the case nor the events that gave rise to the cessation of  employment (A-291-98, A-319-14). \nThere may be situations, such as in the case of a constructive  dismissal, where the employer simply wanted to get rid of the employee. Constructive  dismissal may involve, the employer unilaterally making substantial changes to  the terms of employment, such as reduction in salary, demotion, removal of  compensation or benefits or transfer to another location.  Employees subjected to such changes may decide  to quit the employment.  Once all facts  of the case are obtained, it may be found to be a case of constructive  dismissal without misconduct, or that the voluntary leaving was with just  cause.",0.95369804
457,457,457,"Progressive discipline is when an employer gives increasing punishment for repeated bad behavior. This usually follows a specific process outlined in a policy or agreement. Evidence of this process includes the employer trying to fix the bad behavior and giving harsher punishments for repeated offenses.

For example, an employer might give three verbal warnings, then three written warnings, a suspension, and finally a warning that another issue could lead to being fired. Progressive discipline can also help employees who struggle with problems like addiction that affect their work.

There are key parts to progressive discipline:

1. Employees are warned about bad behavior and given a chance to improve.
2. Employers give more serious punishments for repeated bad behavior.
3. Employees are told their job is at risk.

To prove progressive discipline happened, specific evidence is needed, like the company's policy, proof the employee got and understood the policy, details of past issues and punishments, proof the employee could defend themselves, and details about the final warning and dismissal.

The final incident that leads to dismissal must be due to intentional actions, not something out of the employee's control. If an employee is dismissed for a minor issue, but it was not intentionally done, they may still qualify for benefits.

If there is no formal process, the evidence must show what warnings were given and what actions were taken. If an employer doesn't address bad behavior, it might seem like they are fine with it.

Progressive discipline often follows a  written policy or provisions of a collective agreement that describe exactly  what process must occur before an employee can be dismissed.  Evidence that an employer tried to correct  undesirable conduct and imposed increased sanctions for repeat occurrences can  be evidence of a progressive discipline process. \nProgressive discipline may be a lengthy process.  For example, some employers may follow  procedures which require that three verbal warnings be documented to the  personnel file, followed by three written warnings, suspension and a warning  that a further infraction may result in dismissal. \nProgressive discipline policies may include provisions to  assist an employee who suffers from an addiction that affects job  performance. \nThe common elements in progressive discipline are:\n\nthe employee is warned that a behaviour will not  be tolerated and is given an opportunity to correct that behaviour \nthe employer applies increasingly more serious  consequences for repeated offences\nthe employee is warned that their employment is  at risk \n\nThere must be specific evidence to conclude progressive  discipline.  This includes some or all of  the following:\n\na copy of the company policy \nevidence that the employee received and  understood the policy, such as a signed (written or electronic) confirmation of  receipt of that policy \ndates and details of previous infraction(s) and  the disciplinary actions imposed \ndocumentation showing the employee was given an  opportunity to defend or discuss the alleged misconduct\ndate and details of the final warning \ndate and details of the final incident and  dismissal \n\nThe progressive discipline sequence must be in regard to a  single, specific behaviour.  The evidence  must show the employee understood another incident could, or would, result in  suspension or dismissal.  An employee who  is dismissed for tardiness, but the last warning was two years ago and the  current infraction is minor, may lack the element of wilfulness in the final  incident. \nThe Commission must look at whether the final incident was  wilful.  For example, an employee who is  late for work because a power failure re-set their alarm clock is tardy  due to a circumstance over which there is no control.  The element of wilfulness is missing in that  final incident.  The employer may be  within their rights to end the employment, but the claimant is not necessarily  refused EI benefits even though the employee may have a  history of being late. \nSome employers have policies that say breaking any three rules will result in  suspension or dismissal.  This means that  an employee may, for example, be warned for being tardy and can never be late  again.  The same employee may be warned  about a dress code violation and subsequently always attend the workplace  appropriately attired.  The employee may  then be warned that any further infraction of the rules will result in  dismissal.  The employee may then be  dismissed for failing to follow a minor procedure, although the infraction  would not normally lead to dismissal.   This is not progressive  discipline.  In the example above, the  disciplinary action following each infraction successfully controlled the  behaviour.  The Commission must follow  the normal process in determining whether the final incident was one of  misconduct.\nIf there is no formal process, the evidence must show the  nature of the warnings and what, if any, sanctions were applied to the  employee.  For example, if an employee is  told they have to get to work on time, but is not warned of any consequences,  it is impossible to conclude the employee understood that being late was  considered so serious as to warrant the loss of employment.  When the employer does not intervene, it  appears the employer condones, or accepts the undesirable conduct. \nProgressive discipline must be in relation to conduct that  both lies within the employee's control and affects the employment relationship (A-416-08).",0.99929917

In this case, the Commission must examine the reason for the dismissal.  If the employer did not discover the inappropriate behaviour until after the dismissal, the dismissal did not occur because of the misconduct.

Misconduct can result from an act or omission that occurred prior to the  start of an employment from which the employee is later dismissed in situations  where the misconduct is the direct cause for the dismissal (A-239-06).\nThe Act speaks of a loss of any employment as a  result of misconduct and does not limit a disqualification to the employment  occupied at the time of the misconduct. The relationship between employment and  misconduct is not one of timing but of causation (A-875-96, A-732-95, A-236-94, A-352-94, A-96-95, A-462-10, A-337-07). \nA case illustrating this occurred in which a claimant was  charged with a driving offence and was awaiting a court date.  During this time, the claimant accepted a position as a  driver where maintaining a valid driver's permit was a condition of  employment.

In adjudicating their claim  for benefits it was found that, the fact that the claimant could not retain their employment and had to resign following the loss of their licence, was a breach of  duty which occurred during their employment and that this breach was a direct  result of their misconduct.",0.9972972
460,460,460,"Sometimes, when someone is fired from their job because of something they did wrong, they might later reach an agreement with their employer. This agreement could involve receiving some money or changing the reason for leaving from being fired to quitting. If this happens, it raises the question of whether this agreement affects the original decision that the person was fired for doing something wrong. 

The key to answering this question is to look at what the agreement says. Just having an agreement isn't enough to change the original decision about misconduct unless the agreement provides new information that goes against what the employer originally said about why the person was fired. If the agreement does cast doubt on the person's misconduct, then it may be seen as the person leaving voluntarily instead of being fired for misconduct.

However, if the agreement includes a clause that says neither party can talk about the issue, it usually can't be used as evidence to change the decision about misconduct. In that case, the question shifts to whether the person left voluntarily, which will be decided based on certain guidelines.

So, in simpler terms, when someone who was fired later agrees with their employer on what happened, it might change whether they were fired for doing something wrong or if they left on their own. It all depends on the specifics of the agreement and whether it provides new information that contradicts the original reason for being fired.",63.97348387096777,10.497322580645164,11.003577315987393,12.984516129032258,14.121169354838706,11.908548387096769,51.81612903225806,6.7,0.8971033361223009,0.9038732871413232,2.9014019167966536,0.5677148501780912,0.4723623063096747,0.0579042849001831,4.915322580645161,4.0,2.443904344349186,24.8,24.0,6.144916598294887,1.3911290322580645,1.0,0.6751955626829944,248,118,0.4758064516129032,1248,10,7.2.5.5,Settlement reached since dismissed,Chapter 7 - Misconduct,"There will be situations for which it has been decided the  claimant was dismissed due to their own misconduct and later the employer and  claimant may agree on a settlement agreement.   They may settle for a certain financial sum or the initial reason for  separation may be changed to resignation instead of dismissal and all  references to termination removed from the former employee's file.  The question then becomes whether such  agreements have an impact on the decision of misconduct originally made by the  Commission and whether voluntary leaving should now be considered.\nThe answer lies in the terms used in the agreement.  An agreement is not by itself sufficient to  overturn a finding of misconduct based on all the evidence on file.  In order to contradict a previous finding of  misconduct, an agreement must contain some evidence which can legitimately  contradict the employer's original position with respect to the reason for separation (A-294-06).  The agent will consider the new facts in  addition to the information already on file, compare them against the initial  decision and determine whether the agreement casts doubt on the claimant's  misconduct. If so, it then becomes a case of voluntary leaving (A-170-98).\nAn agreement that includes a without prejudice clause  (which generally expresses that neither party will make statements on the  issue) is not generally admissible in evidence as proof that the loss of employment  was not due to misconduct and does not constitute new facts that could alter or  affect the outcome of the original decision of misconduct (A-233-94, A-45-96).\nIf it is determined that, based on the additional facts from  the agreement, the loss of employment is not due to misconduct, the question  then becomes one of voluntary leaving and will be adjudicated based on guidance  from Chapter 6 of this Digest.",0.9902728

The Federal Court of Appeal decided that the circumstances when a person leaves their job determine why they left. Things that happen after they leave don't matter. For example, if someone says they will quit, but then gets fired for doing something wrong before they actually quit, it's seen as being fired for misconduct. If someone quits and gets fired before they're supposed to leave for reasons not related to quitting, it's considered voluntary quitting.

If an employee tells their employer they're leaving on a certain date, and the employer tells them to leave before that date without pay, it's seen as voluntary quitting. But if they're told to leave early and still get paid until their specified leaving date, it's also voluntary quitting. Even if they get partial pay, it's still voluntary quitting.

The circumstances that may occur after that  time do not have any bearing on the reason the claimant left their employment (EIA 129).  When an employee submits a notice of  resignation and the terms are accepted by the employer but the employee is  released due to misconduct prior to the agreed-upon date of the resignation for  reasons unrelated to the resignation, the separation must be considered due to  misconduct.  If the claimant resigns and  as a consequence is released prior to the effective date, it will be considered  voluntary leaving.  Situational advice  follows.\r\n  7.2.5.6.1  Notice period not worked - No compensation for the notice period\nIf a claimant gives the employer notice that they are  leaving employment on a specific date and the employer advises the claimant to  leave prior to that date, but does not keep them on the payroll for the notice  period, the reason for separation is adjudicated as voluntary leaving and not  dismissal from employment, as it was the claimant who initiated the separation.  Guidance can be found in Chapter 6 of this Digest.  If a disqualification is to be imposed, the  effective date will be the specified date of resignation, not the date the  employer asked them to leave.  The notice  of resignation must have been formal (verbal or written), and not just a  statement to the effect that they planned on leaving or were looking for other  employment.\n7.2.5.6.2  Notice period not worked - Compensation received for the notice period\nSituations in which the employer advises the claimant to  leave immediately but continues to pay them up to the effective date of  resignation requested by the employee, are treated as cases of voluntary  leaving ,not dismissal prior to voluntary leaving.   Again,  in this situation, it was the claimant who initiated the separation from  employment, regardless of whether or not they continue to work or get  paid.  These cases would be adjudicated  according to provisions in Chapter 6 of this Digest.\n7.2.5.6.3  Notice period not worked - Partial compensation for the notice period\nSituations in which an employer partially  compensates the claimant for the notice period are cases of voluntary leaving  as per provisions in Chapter 6 of this Digest.   Any applicable disqualification is effective from the date specified  in the letter of resignation.\n7.2.5.6.4  Dismissal for misconduct prior to the end of the notice period \nWhen an employer dismisses the claimant prior to the  resignation date, for reasons of misconduct, the adjudication principles for  misconduct are used.  The act that caused  the dismissal could have occurred prior to or after the claimant handed in  their resignation.  In either case, when  fact finding is complete, the adjudication principles set out in this chapter of the Digest (dependent on the reason) would be applied.

Thus, in itself, an unjustified absence may  constitute misconduct.\n Absenting oneself for a frivolous reason, using some sort of excuse or pretense,  or refusing to disclose the reason for the absence, constitutes misconduct.  Misconduct is all the more evident if it is not a first offence.\n When permission to be absent was not granted by the employer and the  contention is that the claimant had to be absent regardless, the reason for the  absence becomes of prime importance (A-440-10). What needs to be determined in  such a case is whether the absence was necessary and unavoidable. Plausible  explanations are acceptable. In case of doubt, however, the claimant can be asked  to provide appropriate evidence. In such a case, it is not so much the failure  to provide proof that may result in a disqualification, but rather the fact  that the absence was without justification.\n In many cases, it is a question of credibility. An employee on sick leave  is not expected to remain totally idle during this period. Depending on the  nature of the incapacity, the time may be occupied with leisure pursuits or  domestic duties compatible with the state of health. However, the illness has  to be genuine and not a mere pretext for going about other business, and it  must remain credible given the type of activities pursued.\n Situations of harassment, abuse or violence, toward an employee may lead the  employee to be absent from work without expressly informing their employer of  the true reason for the absence. A dismissal in such circumstances, in which  the absence is related to the harassment and violence suffered by the claimant,  does not constitute misconduct within the meaning of the Act.\n The same may apply when a person is dismissed due to unsatisfactory  performance or behaviour detrimental to their employment - for example,  absenteeism or not getting along with others at work - if this performance or  behaviour stems from events related to harassment or violence suffered by the claimant  at the hands of a spouse or other individual.",0.99454284

It's not fair to get in trouble for not asking permission if you really couldn't help not being there, like if you were sick, as long as you told your boss and provided proof. Asking permission means your boss knows and agrees that you can be away. In big companies, there's usually a formal way to ask for time off.

470,470,470,"When an employee refuses to do tasks that are normally part of their job, it may be seen as misbehavior unless they have a good reason. If the employee thinks that what the employer is asking them to do goes against the law or their work agreement, they should first try to fix the situation by going through the proper channels, like using complaint procedures, before refusing to do the tasks. This is to prevent getting fired for refusing. 

Some laws about workplace safety let workers say no to doing tasks if they believe it might be dangerous to their own or someone else's health or safety. This right to refuse will usually stay in place until the authorities decide if it's safe to go back to work. However, if not doing the tasks right away could harm someone else, or if the work conditions are normal for that job, the refusal might not be allowed.

When an employee is asked to do extra tasks that are not usually part of their job, it depends on whether the employer's request is fair and reasonable. It also matters if the employee is getting paid extra for these extra tasks, or if the employer asked because it was an emergency. If the difference between the new tasks and the usual ones isn't big, refusing might be seen as misbehavior at first. The employee then needs to explain and justify their refusal.

If the extra tasks are unsafe, the worker shouldn't be required to do them blindly. The worker must have a good reason for saying no. So, if the extra tasks are really dangerous, it won't be considered misbehavior if the refusal was because the employee was genuinely worried about their health, safety, or life, instead of just being stubborn or not wanting to do more work.",66.59964535464538,9.855844155844157,11.20814326018867,12.853546453546455,11.16767982017982,8.857012987012983,44.14685314685315,4.846153846153846,0.8525181313355764,0.8674693270163103,2.673806359605799,0.6652902483313634,0.4700247361753457,0.069749954205848,4.405844155844156,4.0,2.2521775037017244,23.692307692307693,24.0,10.665433853807391,1.3733766233766234,1.0,0.7163709232745797,308,147,0.4772727272727273,1401,13,7.3.2.1,Refusal to perform certain duties,Chapter 7 - Misconduct,"When an employee refuses to  perform duties that are normally part of the job, it may be considered as  misconduct unless the refusal can be justified. If it is contended that the  employer's request contravenes provisions of a statute or the collective  agreement, the employee must, before refusing to perform the duties, take  appropriate steps to ensure the application of the statute or collective  agreement using, for example, grievance procedures. In other words, the  employee must try to avoid provoking dismissal by a refusal (A-200-09). \nSome legislation dealing  with occupational health and safety acknowledge the specific right of workers  to refuse to perform duties if they have reasonable grounds for believing that  there is some danger to their own or other persons' health or safety. This  right of refusal is generally granted to the worker until the designated  authorities have rendered a binding decision concerning the resumption of work.  However, a worker cannot refuse to perform certain duties when the immediate  effect of the refusal jeopardizes another person or when the conditions of work  are normal, given the type of occupation. \nWhen the refusal has to do  with additional duties that are not part of the employee's regular duties, the  decision rests on the legitimacy and reasonableness of the employer's request.  Another consideration would be whether the employee was offered monetary compensation  for these additional duties, or whether the employer's request was a special  request made in emergency or unforeseen circumstances. Unless there is a  significant difference between the duties requested and those normally  performed, the refusal constitutes misconduct on first consideration. It is  then up to the claimant to provide an explanation and justify the refusal. \nIf the additional duties  entail a certain danger, the employee cannot be expected to blindly obey.

For example, someone with health issues or who is older may not be able to work as much overtime as someone who is young and healthy.

Employers should try to give employees some advance notice if they need them to work extra hours. This way, employees can plan around their other responsibilities.

- Were threats made?
- Was there aggressive or hostile behavior that made someone react with violence?
- Was any property intentionally damaged?
- Were weapons involved?

Sometimes, violence happens because of bad relationships between people and can include physically hurting someone. This could be considered misconduct, but we need to be careful when deciding. For instance, if someone asked for help from their boss but was provoked and had to protect themselves, it might not be misconduct.

They might include things like wearing safety gear, not using certain dangerous materials, or following rules for transporting hazardous items.

Safety rules are especially strict in areas where there are high risks involved, like in air and marine navigation, railway operations, or working in places like munitions factories and nuclear plants. If someone breaks these rules and an accident happens, it doesn't always mean they did something wrong. But if someone deliberately disobeys the rules, ignores warnings, is negligent, or not paying attention, then it can be considered misconduct.

Sometimes, if a job involves a lot of responsibility, the person must make sure they do it correctly and not just assume everything is fine. Misconduct can be determined by examining the reasons behind a safety violation.

In some industries such as railways, the entire crew can be held responsible for safety breaches or accidents, even if some members are less to blame. For unemployment purposes, misconduct is only considered if the person directly involved in the incident was at fault.

In high-risk industries like air traffic control or nuclear plants, there might be a special team to investigate safety breaches. Their findings don't change the decision made by the Commission. It's important to carefully look at all the information to decide if someone's actions are considered misconduct under the law.

Employees have rights and responsibilities at work. Rules about alcohol and drug use vary depending on the job. Misconduct can occur if these rules are broken, even if there's no official policy against it. Showing up to work drunk can also be considered misconduct.

Some companies conduct drug tests for safety reasons. Drug use might lead to accidents and affect how well the job is done. Being dismissed for drug use before or during employment can be considered misconduct.

Gambling problems can also affect work by causing loss of productivity or even theft. If gambling addiction leads to problems at work, the employer might have grounds to fire the employee. Addictions like gambling can't be used as an excuse for misconduct.

Guidance found in the  pertinent sections of this chapter, such as absence from work (A-315-05),  insubordination, hostile behaviour and breach of rules should be applied.\n\n7.3.4.3.1  Alcohol \nIt can generally be said that every contract of employment  includes an implied prohibition against the consumption of alcohol during  working hours, except under special working conditions, as in the case of wine  tasting, for example, or in special circumstances such as representing one's  firm at a business meal where alcohol is served.\nAs a general rule, misconduct may exist whenever this  prohibition is violated, regardless of whether or not the business had a formal  regulation in this respect.  This is particularly  relevant if the nature of the employment is such that any consumption of  alcohol is banned or not appropriate, such as for someone who drives a public  vehicle or is a police officer or truck driver.\nThe use of alcohol may not take place on the worksite but  still may affect the ability to carry out work duties.  The situation where a person presents  themselves at work in an inebriated state and cannot adequately carry out their  duties could constitute misconduct.\nAlcoholism cannot excuse a claimant for actions amounting to  misconduct and leading to dismissal.  It  is irrelevant whether alcoholism is a addiction or whether the employer  should have accommodated the claimant (A-213-09).\nFor example, where a claimant was dismissed for absenteeism,  it was decided that without evidence of the absence of wilfulness, the repeated  failure to report to work as a result of alcohol consumption is voluntary  behaviour done consciously and with the knowledge of the effects and consequences  this consumption could have on the employment. \n\n\n7.3.4.3.2  Drugs\nMore and more companies are introducing drug testing  policies for reasons of safety to their employees, customers or the general  public. These policies often require that employees who test positive for the  use of illegal drugs be terminated. The level of drugs found in the employee's  system is often not a factor because many companies have a zero tolerance  policy. These tests are usually administered as a condition of employment,  during the probationary period or at random during the employment.  The fact that the drug use may have occurred  prior to the start date of employment is irrelevant.  Loss of any employment as a result of the  misconduct, which is not limited to the employment occupied at the time of  misconduct, is still misconduct under the Act (A-239-06, A-875-96). \n The fact that some people use substances such as illicit  drugs, or that some people misuse prescription drugs is not new. Awareness that  the abuse of substances may affect the workplace just as the workplace may  affect substance abuse is, however, growing. Many aspects of the workplace  today require alertness as well as accurate and quick reflexes. Employers may  dismiss an employee due to the fact that drugs impede these qualities, which  may cause serious accidents and interfere with the accuracy and efficiency of  work. It is not the act of taking drugs that is the cause for the dismissal,  but the effects of taking drugs on the ability to fulfill the conditions of  employment, that are the reason for the dismissal and the finding of misconduct.\nIt is important to conduct in-depth fact-finding and present  relevant documentation in decisions of misconduct to ensure the burden of proof  that the claimant lost their employment due to their misconduct, is met (A-135-01, A-72-02).\n\n7.3.4.3.3  Gambling\nThe effects of a gambling problem may spill over into the  workplace, primarily through lost time, lost productivity, and in  desperate situations, the gambler may resort to theft.\nIndividuals with gambling problems can become completely  pre-occupied with gambling. The workday can be spent  in the act of gambling, planning the next  gambling opportunity, or plotting to get money for gambling.  Any of these activities may breach the  employment contract.\nAs a result of the lost time, a company's productivity is  often damaged. The gambler becomes unreliable, misses project deadlines and  important meetings and produces inferior quality work.  Employees with severe problems may commit  theft, fraud or embezzlement (CUB 54535).  If a claimant has been dismissed due to a  gambling problem, the employer most likely has background and facts to support  their decision.  Again, it is not the  gambling alone that causes the dismissal, many people gamble and their work is  not affected.  It is the result of the  gambling addiction on the workplace which leads to the dismissal that must be considered  when reaching a decision of misconduct.\nThe Commission, as in all cases of misconduct, must look at  the claimant's explanations for their actions.   If the claimant had been leaving work early to gamble, then the issue  would be addressed similarly to other persons in the workforce who are absent  from work without permission.\nSome of the issues associated with unreliability and  inaptitude can be found in the section on dereliction of duties.\nIn each case the facts must support the conclusion that  misconduct was involved and the claimant would have had to be aware of the  effects this would have on their job (A-381-85, A-1342-92).\nGambling, like any other addiction, should not be used as an  excuse to avoid a finding of misconduct.   There is a strong possibility that a person who loses their employment  as a result of behaviour associated with an addiction may not be entitled to EI  regular benefits (A-255-03).",0.9949352
480,480,480,"An employment contract is an agreement between an employer and an employee. The employer pays the employee for their work. Both parties need to follow certain rules and act ethically. Misconduct refers to actions or behaviors by an employee that go against the goals of the job, create a conflict of interest, or harm the trust between the employer and the employee. This can include things like sleeping on the job, using the employer's resources without permission, or stealing from the employer. Making mistakes due to lack of experience or pressure at work is not considered misconduct unless it happens on purpose or because the employee refuses to follow the rules. 

Making a mistake in judgment at work, unless it involves clear negligence or dishonesty, is usually not considered misconduct. Also, if a person lies on their job application but didn't realize it could make them lose the job, it might not be seen as misconduct. For example, saying they lived in one place instead of another might not be a big deal, but lying about having a degree or a clean driving record could be if those are requirements for the job and the person knew that.",60.68066443327753,10.28860971524288,12.45797560212912,13.668565047459522,11.73178671133445,10.45889447236181,49.749302065884976,6.111111111111111,0.8302769437432289,0.8119161256722042,2.987547577870158,0.8273467047295276,0.4652983714811671,0.0680863530086542,4.693467336683417,4.0,2.587466415229024,22.11111111111111,20.0,10.71286292728351,1.4623115577889447,1.0,0.7416785820098529,199,115,0.5778894472361809,958,9,7.3.4.4,Dereliction of duty,Chapter 7 - Misconduct,"An employment contract can be broadly defined as an  agreement between employer and employee assigning payment and benefits to the  employee in exchange for services.  This  implies respect for rules of conduct agreed to by the parties and sanctioned by  professional ethics, common sense, usage or custom.\nThere are numerous acts and omissions that can be labelled  misconduct, in the sense that they are incompatible with the objectives of an  employment contract, present a conflict of interest with the employer's activities, or have a negative effect  on the relationship of trust between the parties. This would also be the case  where it is a violation of a law, a regulation, or of a professional code of  ethics that results in a breach of a condition of employment leading to the  dismissal. \nThis applies, for example,  to sleeping on the job, making long-distance telephone calls at the employer's  expense, taking supplies for one's own personal use without authorization,  falsifying expense accounts or time sheets, selling articles belonging to the  employer without authorization, or taking money from the employer's till  without authorization, even if intending to later replace it (CUB 76342). \nIncompetence, unsatisfactory performance, inaptitude to  perform certain duties, or an error attributable to intense pressure at work or  inexperience does not amount to misconduct unless it is wilful or the result of  unwillingness to abide by the employer's rules or procedures (A-337-07, A-64-06). The fact that other employees could be guilty of the same misconduct and not be dismissed is irrelevant.\nIn addition, unless there is  clear negligence or dishonesty, an error in judgment in decisions made or actions taken in the course of  employment may not amount to misconduct.\nDepending on the nature of the dishonesty, a false statement  made at the time of applying for work cannot generally support the conclusion  that the loss of employment was due to misconduct.  The Commission will examine whether the  claimant would have had reason to believe that such a false statement would  cost them their employment, if discovered.   A simple misrepresentation as to where they lived at the time of  application, would not affect performance at work, whereas a false statement  that they had the required university degree or a clean driving record would  constitute misconduct if the claimant knew these conditions were required for  the position.  The same false statement  about a clean driving record may not constitute misconduct if the claimant was  applying for a cashier position and had no expectation that the driving record  would affect their ability to do that job and wanted to appear more responsible  to the employer.",0.98086655
481,481,481,"An employer expects employees to behave ethically at work and use company resources wisely. Personal use of resources should not cost the company money or disrupt work. Using resources for non-work reasons is only okay if the employer says so. If employees misuse equipment on purpose, it's considered misconduct.

Misusing company resources can take different forms like making unauthorized calls, using work equipment for personal things, or lying on expense reports. Accepting gifts for special treatment is also wrong.

When it comes to computers, emails, and the internet at work, employees should only use them for work. Emails should not contain offensive content or be used for personal reasons without permission.

Using company credit cards for personal expenses, like private phone bills or personal travel, can lead to losing your job. Each company has rules for credit card use, and misusing them can be considered misconduct. It's important to follow the guidelines and get permission for any personal use.

Employees are expected to use good judgment in the use of company  resources.  Any personal use of company  resources should not incur significant added costs, disruption of business  processes, loss of work performance or any other disadvantage to the employer.  Use of company resources for non-company purposes is appropriate only when  specifically authorized by the employer. \nEmployees can unknowingly compromise the security and  integrity of the employer through the improper use of company equipment.  To conclude misconduct, the claimant would  have had to be aware that they were misusing the equipment or resources but  chose to do it anyway. \nMisuse of company resources can have many different forms.  It may be by making unauthorized long  distance telephone calls (CUB 40938, CUB  27984), using company equipment for personal use  or submitting inaccurate expense accounts (CUB 68295, CUB 75036).  Taking gifts from customers or suppliers in  return for using their services or purchasing their equipment or products is  also a misuse of company resources. \n\n7.3.4.5.1  Computer, internet and email\nEmployees at work should be using the office equipment for  the sole purpose of conducting company business.  The use should not interfere with the  performance of business, the employee's assigned duties, and should not  adversely affect the performance of the employee.\nE-mail in the workplace is not intended to be used for  external broadcast messages or to send or post chain letters, messages of a  political or religious nature, or messages that contain obscene, profane, or  otherwise offensive language or material (CUB 75946, CUB 71685).  Employees may use E-mail to send messages with  union-related content only with approval of management. \nEquipment, such as computers and copiers, are provided for  the conduct of company business. The company may incur costs based on the rate  of use of such equipment.  Personal use  of a company system or network for any purpose except in accordance with  company policy and procedure can be grounds for dismissal for misconduct (CUB 70558).  If the employee requires the use of the  computer to conduct personal business, permission should be sought from the  employer before doing so.  In addition,  such use should not be on work time.\n\n\n7.3.4.5.2  Credit cards\nMany employers issue credit cards to their employees for  conducting day to day business.\n Loss of employment for inappropriate use of company credit cards could  constitute misconduct.  Some examples of  misuse might include using the credit card to cover private expenses; private telephone accounts including  internet/broadband services; purchasing gasoline for personal vehicles;  personal professional association membership fees; travel costs when the  claimant is to receive a per diem or specified travel advance; withdrawal of  cash /cash advances for personal expenditures\n Common sense  dictates the charges for which the credit card can legitimately be used.  Many companies will have a written policy,  but smaller employers may have a verbal discussion regarding the uses for which  the credit card is approved.  An innocent  charge for a small amount, (ex. dry cleaning charges required for clothing  while travelling,) would not necessarily be considered by the claimant as an  action which could cause the termination of their employment, although it is  definitely a personal expense.  All  details of the incident causing the dismissal must be obtained before a  determination of misconduct can be made.",0.9968972
482,482,482,"Jurisprudence says that if a criminal act causes someone to lose their job, just being charged with a crime doesn't necessarily mean they did something wrong. It can be hard to figure out what happened when a crime is involved in deciding if someone should get benefits. The commission can decide on benefits without waiting for the police or court decisions. The charges or verdict in a criminal case don't automatically mean misconduct. It might take a long time from when charges are filed to when a case is heard. The commission decides on benefits based on information from the person applying and their employer. They don't investigate like the police or courts do. Both the person applying and their employer tell their side of what happened leading to the job loss, and the commission makes a decision based on that info. If there's not enough clear info, the decision is based on what is most likely true. The commission can review their decision if asked by the person applying or the employer, especially if new info comes up in court. Being convicted of a crime linked to losing a job can mean no benefits. Being in jail or on house arrest can lead to losing a job due to misconduct. Having a criminal record can make it hard to find work, so some people might not say if they have a record when getting hired.

It is not  unusual in this type of case to have a lengthy delay between the laying of  charges and the hearing. The decision as to entitlement to benefit will not be  delayed in such circumstances unless the case is expected to be heard very  soon. \nThe Commission's decision is  based on the information gathered from both the claimant and the employer.  There will be a reasonable search for the pertinent facts. This is not an  intensive investigation to demonstrate beyond any doubt that the person was or  was not guilty of the infraction, nor is there an exhaustive interrogation.  These roles belong to the Crown and other tribunals of competent jurisdiction,  and not to the Commission. \nBoth the claimant and the employer must be:\n\nasked for their account of the incident that gave  rise to the claimant's dismissal \nable to describe from their own perspective, the  circumstances surrounding the incident that led to the dismissal, and clarify  any contradictions \nmade aware of the fact that the Commission's  decision to pay benefits or not, will be made on the basis of the information  provided \n\nThe employer may be  reluctant to divulge certain relevant information, or may possess little  information when the offence occurred outside the workplace. \nThis information relating  mainly to the actions or omissions of  the claimant is nonetheless essential for arriving at a decision. It is no more  permissible in this type of offence than for other types to rely on vague  statements, presumptions or an assumption that the employer must surely have  had good reasons for dismissing the claimant. \nWhen faced with insufficient or ambiguous information the decision will  rely on the balance of probabilities, on what seems most likely, based on all  of the credible information obtained.\nThe Commission's decision may be revisited once the courts have  rendered judgement, if the claimant or employer request that the decision be  reconsidered.  When the Commission has  ruled no misconduct it is the Court's reasons for the guilty decision or plea  that will be considered. These reasons may bring to light new facts never  presented to the Commission and may result in a review of the decision.  However, if all the facts were before the Commission and the officer originally  concluded no misconduct, that decision cannot simply be changed because the  claimant was found guilty, based on those same facts. Likewise, if the decision  was misconduct and the claimant is acquitted rather than found guilty, the  decision may be reconsidered but there is no obligation to do so. \nWithdrawal of a charge in criminal proceedings often simply means the  Crown lacks sufficient evidence to incriminate the claimant beyond any  reasonable doubt. Misconduct within the meaning of the EI Act is determined on the basis of the balance of probabilities, which  is much less stringent. \nThe offence which constitutes an infraction or a criminal act which results in a conviction under  the Criminal Code would be misconduct  resulting in a disqualification when it led to a dismissal because the employee  could no longer meet the conditions of employment. \nClaimants who are jailed or imposed a conditional sentence of house arrest (CUB 66756) and subsequently dismissed  by the employer as they are not able to provide services, are considered to  have lost their employment by reason of their own misconduct (A-1342-92). \n Having a record of convictions can be a serious obstacle for  individuals seeking employment. As a result, it is fairly common for someone  not to reveal the existence of a conviction record when hired.  If the employer later learns about this  record and decides to dismiss the worker solely for this reason, once reviewed,  the separation may  not be considered to  be misconduct for EI purposes.",0.9351872

Failure to pay traffic fines and particularly  the accumulation of unpaid traffic tickets or failure to comply with a court  order reveals deliberate, reckless or negligent behaviour on the part of the  claimant.  The loss of employment is due  to the fact that the employee is no longer in a position to fulfill the  conditions of the employment contract (A-720-01, A-72-04). \nIf a person loses a driver's licence for neglecting to pay  child support, the loss of licence does not arise from an offence, but rather  from non-compliance with a court order (A-666-02, A-78-04). \nIf the loss of licence is due to non-compliance with a court  order it is possible for a person to prove justification by showing that they  used every avenue available to them for assistance, that they were neither  negligent nor reckless with regard to their obligations and were not defiant  toward judicial authorities.  All factors  must be considered before determining if misconduct exists.\nThere may be situations where an employer decides to suspend  an employee due to loss of their driver's licence, allowing them time to  enquire about re-acquiring the licence.   At the time of the suspension, depending on the facts on file, a finding  of suspension for misconduct may be made.   If so, a disentitlement is imposed.\nIf the employee, upon their return to work after re-acquiring  their licence, is dismissed by their employer due to the loss of their driver's  licence, a finding of misconduct cannot be made (A-90-07).  As indicated earlier, the Commission cannot  make a finding of misconduct if an employer initially imposes a milder  punishment and later decides to dismiss the employee for the same infraction.\nThe Commission will need to collect information from the  claimant concerning the reasons they failed to comply with the court order and  what alternatives were available to them.   Was there any assistance available to individuals who are unable to pay  a fine or fulfill a commitment due to financial difficulties?  If the claimant raises financial difficulties  as justification for their non-compliance, the fact finding should not just  focus on the claimant's financial situation, but also on what measures or  arrangements the claimant made, or could have made, to obtain more time to make  the payment, thereby preventing the loss of the driver's licence.  Should it have been possible for them to make  arrangements, then their financial situation alone cannot be used to make a  finding that misconduct was proven (A-72-04).",0.9974113
485,485,485,"The labor laws give everyone the right to join a labor group or union of their choice and to take part in its activities. Getting fired for using this right is not considered a bad behavior. What's allowed in these activities follows the rules set by state or federal laws on labor or any agreements between an employer and union in a work contract.

Union representatives have to follow their employer's directions like other workers do. Sometimes, a worker might claim they were fired because they were in a union, especially when a new union is starting or during a labor dispute. Usually, if nothing against the rules happened, then the firing was probably for other reasons stated by the employer. 

Dealing with different reasons for firing makes it hard to find out the truth and decide who's telling the truth. To stop someone from getting benefits, there must be clear proof that the loss of the job was because of the person's behavior. If someone loses their job because of reasons other than what's officially said, then they shouldn't be disqualified from getting benefits.

Taking part in a strike that's against the law is considered bad behavior, even if many employees were involved.

Because the employee's actions triggered this period of unemployment,  the reasons for the suspension are subject to the same considerations as having  the employment terminated by the employer.   Since the suspension is a temporary situation, a finding of misconduct  results in a disentitlement rather than a disqualification.  The disentitlement applies to each day of the  suspension.\nThe suspension may be for a few days or interspersed with  employment.  With a finding of  misconduct, the claimant will be disentitled for any days that constitute a  suspension.\nThe suspension from the employment may be with or without  pay.  The terms of the suspension must require that the person return to  work on a date agreed to by the claimant and the employer, in order to  determine the period of any potential disentitlement.\nJust because the employer suspended the claimant, it does  not mean the reason for this was misconduct within the meaning of the EI Act.  The Commission will determine,  based on the information gathered, whether the suspension was as a result of  the claimant's own misconduct.  Current  adjudication principles concerning such a finding continue to apply in these  cases.\nWhen it is shown that a person has been suspended by reason of misconduct, a disentitlement will be imposed and the person will not be entitled to receive benefits until they meet one of three provisions outlined in section 31 of the EI Act.\n(a) The period of suspension expires\nWhether or not the person returns to work following the  suspension is not an issue with respect to the termination of the  disentitlement.  It will suffice that the  suspension is over.  However, if the  claimant does not recommence employment, the officer must consider the issue  of voluntary leaving and just cause pursuant to sections 29 and 30 of the EI Act.\n(b) The claimant loses or  voluntarily leaves the employment\nUnlike indefinite  disqualifications, to lose employment in these situations does not necessarily  mean that the person was dismissed.  The  condition to terminate the disentitlement will be met if the person is dismissed or  quits the employment.  Of course, should  the person quit without just cause or be dismissed for misconduct, these issues  must be addressed in order to assess their entitlement to benefits.\nIn situations of lay-offs  during a suspension where there is a complete and final severance of the  employer-employee relationship that leaves a claimant with no possibility to  resume work, a suspension ends as of the date the employment permanently  ends.  It must be noted that the date the  employment ends is the day on which the employer/employee relationship is permanently  severed.  It is not the last day worked  prior to the suspension.  As long as  the claimant meets all other entitlement conditions, benefits may be payable as  of the end of the disentitlement.\n(c) The claimant, after the beginning of the period of  suspension, accumulates with another employer the number of hours of insurable  employment required by section 7 or 7.1 to qualify to receive benefits\nUnlike indefinite disqualifications, the claimant is only  required to meet the requalifying conditions; a new claim need not be  established.  If the claim is a renewal,  the disentitlement is terminated at the point the Variable Entrance Requirement  (VER) is met.  If it is an initial claim,  and the VER has been met, the disentitlement is not imposed.\nIf the conditions for ending the disentitlement have not  been met when the claim ends the disentitlement will be carried over to the  next benefit period.\nIf the claimant decides to voluntarily quit the employment  while on suspension, the disentitlement will be terminated on the date prior to  the date the claimant decided to voluntarily leave.  The officer must then adjudicate the reason  for voluntarily leaving pursuant to sections 29 and 30 of the EI Act.\nOfficers will impose the disentitlement for each day of  suspension.  However, if the suspension  is to end on a future date, the officer will impose an indefinite  disentitlement for control purposes; to ensure all entitlement conditions are  being met at that time.",0.99214244

Generally, the claimant bears the onus of proof of  entitlement to benefits in general, including in the context of labour disputes.

501,501,501,"The word dispute is not clearly defined in the law. Court cases have looked at dictionary definitions which say a dispute is when two sides disagree and argue about something. A dispute typically involves one side insisting on something and the other side resisting. This can happen in various situations like when negotiations break down, a strike is voted on, or a lockout is announced.

Different signs can show that a dispute is happening, like slow work, meetings to discuss complaints, refusing to work or serve customers, or even protests. A labor dispute is a factual disagreement, and it doesn't always require a strike or lockout. Grievances alone don't mean there's a dispute, but if disputes lead to work stoppages or layoffs, then a labor dispute likely exists.

Just because negotiations are going smoothly doesn't mean there's no dispute. Disagreements can still exist even if there's no strike or lockout. Also, a lockout before employees review employer proposals is still seen as a dispute. It's important to note that some situations, like employees refusing to work without pay due to financial issues of the employer, might not be considered a labor dispute.

In tough economic times, an employer might ask the union to change some terms in the work contract to save money. If the union says no, it might not automatically mean a dispute, but it could lead to one if the two sides can't agree on things like reducing the workforce or wages.",68.0767617866005,8.503225806451617,11.20814326018867,11.824317617866006,10.367009925558314,10.436129032258062,45.68982630272953,5.076923076923077,0.8434849679470062,0.8136415481567383,2.84729220758705,0.7325184160452796,0.4226376093151309,0.0773832829359488,4.725806451612903,4.0,2.675572623900317,19.07692307692308,20.0,6.810190762735804,1.4112903225806452,1.0,0.7072447308118925,248,136,0.5483870967741935,1220,13,8.2.2,Distinctive features of a dispute,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes,"The word dispute is not specifically defined in the  legislation (CUB  21211). Case law has relied on dictionary definitions to the  effect that a dispute means a difference of opinion, a controversy based on  argumentation or the expression of contrary opinions or assertions (FCA  A-186-03, CUB  56057, CUB  37885).\nInvariably, these definitions contain  two elements that are essential features of a dispute: evidence of insistence  by one party and resistance by the other, with respect to specific demands.  These two essential features are present when there is a refusal to negotiate, a disruption of negotiations, appointment of a  conciliator or conciliation board, when the conciliation process fails, taking  a strike vote, or issuance of a lockout notice. The existence of a strike or  lockout is even more decisive.\nA variety of situations may indicate that a dispute exists: ongoing negotiations,  a slowdown, the calling of special meetings, concerted formulation of  grievances, refusal to handle prohibited materials or to serve customers,  refusal to work, demonstrations, withdrawal of services, mass absenteeism or  resignation, picketing, stoppage of work, strategic shutdown of premises,  lay-off, suspension or dismissal.\nA labour dispute is a question of fact; it is not necessary that there  exist a strike or lockout. The essential element is a clear indication that  there is insistence by one party and resistance by another. A labour dispute  exists, and continues to exist, so long as there is insistence by one party and  resistance by the other with respect to  employment, non-employment or working conditions (CUB  39840, and CUB  21211).  Strikes and  lock-outs are pressure tactics available to employees and employers  respectively. Alone, they do not constitute a dispute; rather, they are the result  of a dispute.\nThe existence of grievances is not enough to conclude that there is a  dispute; clearly, where a collective agreement is in force, numerous grievances  may be filed and submitted to arbitration without there being a labour dispute.  However, if a difference between the employer and the union leads to either a  legal or illegal stoppage of work resulting from a strike, lock-out or even a  major lay-off, it would be difficult to conclude that there is no labour  dispute.\nIt cannot be argued that no dispute exists between parties negotiating a  collective agreement, simply because such negotiations are proceeding smoothly,  there is no request for conciliation, and no withdrawal of labour or picketing.  A dispute is a disagreement. The parties negotiating a collective agreement are  in disagreement. The purpose of negotiation is precisely to put an end to the  disagreement (FCA  A-787-81, CUB  6801).\nNor is it realistic to claim there is no dispute where a lockout occurs before employees have had an opportunity to study the employer's proposals. The  same conclusion has been reached with respect to the argument that ongoing negotiations  did not indicate a dispute (CUB  21211).\nFinally, it should be noted that even if the definition of labour  dispute is broad, it does not include the refusal of one or more employees to  continue working without pay for an employer in serious financial difficulty.\nIn a situation of economic slowdown, an employer may ask the union to  reopen the collective agreement in order to lower some monetary provisions of  the current labour contract.  Otherwise  there may be no other choice than to lay off some of the labour force, or even close  the operations (CUB  46110 and CUB  24335). The Union's refusal of such a request cannot by itself,  be considered an element of resistance which is part of a dispute. This could, however, be the starting point of a real dispute between the parties about, for  example, the conditions of the labour force reduction, or a wage reduction.",0.9782054

If a conflict arises with a third party, like the owner of a workplace or the government, and the employer has a say or follows the third party's stance, the employer is also involved in the dispute. Disagreements between employers, like a general contractor and a subcontractor, are not classified as labor disputes. In situations where the employer-employee relationship has broken down with no room for negotiation, a dispute between an employer and recently laid-off employees can be seen as a labor dispute.

A labor dispute suggests that employees are working together, even if only a small group is involved. If an employee clashes with an employer and other employees support the employee, it may be categorized as a labor dispute. The conflict doesn't have to specifically involve the claimant's employer; it can be with any employer that operates where the claimant works, if a work stoppage due to a labor dispute affects them.

Certain employees who can't form an official labor organization due to their job nature can still join professional associations to voice their concerns. These employees, including those who partially own a business, are still covered under labor dispute regulations as long as they are insurable and not self-employed.

Employees can participate in a dispute directly or through a representative or union. Employers can negotiate themselves or delegate this task. In some cases, negotiations happen at a higher level through employer associations or union federations.

It's crucial to ensure that representatives or unions genuinely represent employees' interests in a dispute and have their consent. The legality of their mandate is not the main concern. The same applies to an employer's representative or association.

If employees are involved in a dispute, whether or not they are part of a union or if the union is actively involved doesn't change the classification of the disagreement as a labor dispute. The main factor is the existence of a dispute between the involved parties.

Labor laws account for a transition period where unions may clash over representing employees. Disagreements arising from this situation are also classified as labor disputes, similar to conflicts among employees regarding their union representation.",51.57618827997831,11.138643516006514,13.856773240637724,15.075637547476942,12.888928377645144,12.847628865979376,54.69940314704287,7.0,0.8480663067764707,0.8418663144111633,2.617630333553338,0.5627334989657721,0.4513492627284766,0.0675236659404447,5.118556701030927,4.0,3.0957846263864286,20.42105263157895,19.0,8.634787593606667,1.5902061855670102,1.0,0.9358864582000058,388,177,0.4561855670103092,2042,19,8.2.3,Parties to the dispute,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes,"Among other considerations, in order to  meet the statutory definition of a labour  dispute, one of the parties must be the employee, and the other, either the  employer or other employees (EI Act 2(1)).\nA dispute may sometimes appear to be between employees and a third party  who is not the employer, for example the owner of a place of employment or the  government. If the employer has say in the matter or is bound to adopt the  position taken by the third party, then the employer is deemed a party (CUB  21211).\nA conflict resulting only from relations between employers, such as a  general contractor and a subcontractor on a construction site, does not meet  the definition of labour dispute. When the employer-employee relationship has  been definitively broken and there is no longer any possibility of continuing  negotiations, a dispute between an employer and employees who have recently been  temporarily laid off constitutes a labour dispute (FCA  A-0595.00;  CUB45670A; Digest  8.5.4).\nThe very idea of a labour dispute implies that the actions of employees  are coordinated, even if only a very limited number of employees, such as those  of a single grade or class of workers, are actually involved. This would not be  the case for a disagreement between an employer and a single employee, unless  this disagreement draws in other employees who support the position taken by  the employee.\nThe dispute need not be one between the employer of the claimant and a  group of employees; it can be any employer, doing business at the same place of  employment where the claimant works, and where the stoppage of work  attributable to a labour dispute has occurred. Although not involved in the  particular dispute, a claimant is still affected by the labour dispute  provisions simply because of working in the same place as others who have  provoked the work stoppage and the resulting general loss of employment (CUB  20493).\nBecause of the nature of their work, those engaged in certain  administrative functions or professions may be unable to form an accredited  association under the relevant labour legislation. However, they may still join  professional associations to defend their interests and make demands. They  remain employees under the statute, and conflicts between them and their  employers are considered labour disputes (CUB  48786).  The same is true for employees who own part of  the business, so long as the employment is considered insurable and they are  not self-employed (CUB  28095).\nEmployees may be involved in a dispute either directly, or via a  representative or trade union. Similarly, an employer may negotiate in person,  or by delegating powers to a negotiator or an association. In some cases, there  are no discussions at the local level; employers' associations or a union  federation may conduct negotiations.\nThere is no point in questioning the legality of a representative's  mandate or of the union's accreditation. It is, however, appropriate to verify  whether the representative or the union is actually acting on behalf of the  employees, with their expressed or implied consent, and that they have not  dissociated themselves from the stand taken on their behalf (S.C.C.19094, CUB  8764). The same reasoning applies to the employer's  representative or association.\nWhen employees are directly involved in the dispute, it is immaterial  whether they are unionized or whether the union plays an active role in the  dispute. Nor is it crucial that the employees have the right to strike or that  the employer is entitled to declare a lockout. The key consideration is whether  a dispute does, in fact, exist between the parties.\nLabour legislation provides, among other things,  for a raiding period, and this may result in disputes between  unions about the representation of employees; some may choose to be represented  by one union while others take a different position. Disagreements resulting  from this situation are labour disputes similar to those among employees about  which union should be their bargaining agent (CUB  15967 and CUB  14236).",0.9962633
503,503,503,"The problem between two sides isn't always straightforward. There are specific things that must be involved, like hiring or not hiring people, or the terms and conditions of their work. Disputes usually happen when negotiating a group agreement about things like pay, work hours, job type, productivity, job security, seniority, or benefits. Sometimes disagreements about a contract clause can lead to a labor dispute before the contract ends. Creating a local union or choosing a union to bargain can also lead to conflicts because it might change how things work. Arguments about firing or not firing coworkers can also cause a labor dispute, even if it's just about one person.

The act  specifies that at least one of the following elements must be involved:\n\nthe employment or non-employment of one or several individuals, or\ntheir terms or conditions of work.\n\nIn most cases, disputes arise from negotiations related to the  resolution of a collective agreement (CUB  21211). Normally, such disputes concern terms or conditions of  employment such as wages, hours of work, job classification, productivity, job  security, union security, seniority rights or fringe benefits (CUB  15967 and CUB  14236).\nSometimes labour disputes arise prior to the expiry of a collective  agreement or as a reaction to working conditions dictated by legislation. Such  disputes are often tied to differences about the application or interpretation  of a clause in a collective agreement. Thus, a labour dispute was held to exist  where there was a disagreement over the bonus plan, the method of payment, a  wage cut, hours of work, the applicable hourly rate, indexing, transportation,  identity cards, union security and the grievance procedure, departmental  transfers and the handling of prohibited materials (CUB  21211, CUB  20493 and CUB  20494).\nThe creation of a union local or the subsequent choice of a union as  bargaining agent can also be a source of confrontation that may provoke  disputes. Here there is little question of the existence of labour disputes,  because recognition of a bargaining agent may not only considerably alter  existing working conditions, but may itself constitute a new employment  condition (CUB  21211).\nDismissal or non-dismissal of fellow workers may lead to opposition that  falls within the definition of a labour dispute. Although the word  persons is in the plural in the act a dispute may still exist when  it has been brought about by even a disagreement over the employment or  non-employment of a single individual (Digest  8.2.1).\nHowever, a disagreement arising from the refusal  of employees to commit an illegal act cannot be considered a labour dispute.  Moreover, the refusal of one or many employees to work without pay should not  be included in the definition of a labour dispute.",0.8960641

For example: where employees of different plants have joined  together in a common cause, or where employees of the same employer, but in  different places of employment, are covered by the same collective agreement.  Similarly, there are situations in which negotiations are conducted by an  association of employers and a union federation; any dispute at this level also  involves the local level (EI  Act 36(1); FCA  A-800-87, CUB 11295A; and FCA  A-209-89, CUB 16202).\nIt is not necessary that the claimant's employer be a party to the  dispute.

506,506,506,"The terms ""labour dispute"", ""strike"", and ""lock-out"" are not exactly the same. A labour dispute typically happens before a strike or lockout, although sometimes they can happen at the same time. Strikes or lockouts actually result from a dispute, used as a last option by the involved parties to show their side during the dispute. Just being unhappy or having different opinions is not enough to be considered a full-on labour dispute.

A labour dispute usually starts with negotiations that can vary in length and intensity. The dispute itself is marked by one party standing firm on their position and the other party resisting it. Even if there were no negotiations before a particular case, it doesn't mean there's no dispute; one party may have simply refused to negotiate.

A dispute doesn't necessarily happen right at the start of negotiations; it usually becomes clear during negotiations when the parties take different stances. Sometimes, there might be a disagreement about when a dispute officially starts.

Signs of dissatisfaction, differences of opinion, the existence of grievances, and vague feelings of unrest or discontent are not sufficient in themselves to indicate the presence of a labour dispute.\nA labour dispute is usually preceded by negotiations of varying length  or intensity. The dispute itself is characterized by insistence by one party  and resistance by the other (CUB  21211).

For a sympathetic  dispute to exist mere expressions of solidarity are not enough; there must be real  acts of solidarity (CUB  21211).\nEmployee tactics have included sympathy strikes, or wildcat walkouts;  employers may sometimes show their solidarity by lockouts or plant shutdowns.  It is also common to refuse to handle hot materials, i.e., those  affected by an outside dispute. All of these tactics constitute labour disputes  in and of themselves (CUB  20493).\nAt times, strikers find it advantageous to form picket lines at a place  of employment where there is no labour dispute (Digest  8.2.2; Digest  8.2.5). In other cases, workers  employed at a distinct place of employment may be faced with a picket line set  up at a common entrance. Thus, employee sympathy may also be expressed by  respecting a picket line instead of going to work.\nFailure to cross a picket line amounts to a form of participation in the  dispute; a dispute that has begun elsewhere is deemed to have spread to the  claimant's place of employment. Evidence of non-participation may serve to  disprove this extension of the dispute (Digest  8.6.6 and Digest 8.6.7). Taking  legal means to cross the picket line cannot by itself, of course, constitute a  labour dispute.\nIn cases where an outside dispute has spread from one location to  another, the claimant's own terms or conditions of employment need not be  issues in dispute.

509,509,509,"The term ""place of employment"" has been understood and used the same way for many years. Recent court decisions have supported this understanding. According to the act, a place of employment is where a worker was employed, such as a factory or workshop.

In labor dispute situations, the term ""place of employment"" has a strict meaning. It refers to a specific geographic area where all the conditions for labor dispute rules are met. If there are different activities in the same location, each activity is seen as a separate place of employment.

Recognizing a specific place of employment may lead to disagreements. It's important to differentiate between different cases like distinct geographic sites, activities or services in the same location, construction and logging industries, commercial vehicles, national businesses, and merchant marine.",55.10949718045117,9.70277255639098,14.005844860021307,15.371804511278198,11.671973684210528,13.366917293233085,50.45958646616541,5.625,0.8275133371353149,0.8369681437810262,2.493245144947932,0.5932636373928646,0.4482826523751446,0.0692092660533987,5.2631578947368425,4.0,3.1357620384103475,16.625,16.5,6.460214779711275,1.593984962406015,1.0,0.9014407347519364,133,83,0.6240601503759399,723,8,8.3.0,Place of employment,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes,"The term place of employment has been understood and applied  in much the same way for many years, and recent judgments on this subject have supported  this understanding.

511,511,511,"The term ""premises"" mentioned in the law doesn't always mean a building with four walls. It could refer to a main building and other buildings, or all buildings on the same property.

When deciding if different areas are considered the same premises or different businesses, factors like the type of work done, products or services offered, how departments are connected, management relationships, and physical distance between work areas need to be considered.

Just having different types of tasks being done, like office work versus physical labor, isn't enough to consider them separate businesses. If a company offers distinct services, like a vending machine and a cafeteria, each group of workers can be seen as having a separate place of work.

If multiple buildings are enclosed together, they are usually seen as one place of work if they are part of the same business. However, departments not normally linked to the same company might be viewed as separate businesses.

There have been cases where different departments sharing a location have been viewed as separate businesses, like an electric power plant connected to a sawmill. But a smelter and its associated railway and construction ventures could be seen as one business despite being legally separate.

If different operations, like a sawmill, garage, dock, logging camp, and cardboard mill, are all managed from an office within the mill, then office and mill workers are seen as working in the same place. However, exceptions can be made for office employees only linked to logging operations.

In some situations, a depot within the same building as the main office but associated with operations in a different location can be considered a different workplace. 

Lastly, seasonal repairs may not always be seen as separate from regular operations, but workers contracted from outside for specific tasks might have distinct workplaces from plant employees.",54.28062914721065,11.66964856230032,13.274406872562384,14.870385844187764,14.489515851560585,12.783897763578274,56.664782501843206,7.846153846153846,0.8820652564366659,0.8830263452096418,3.0743532251633834,0.6939986798653645,0.4464307123342367,0.0415332001120262,5.070287539936103,4.0,2.7039514772721405,24.07692307692308,23.0,7.640595410362472,1.5143769968051115,1.0,0.7753908702347333,313,146,0.4664536741214057,1632,13,8.3.2,Activities or services sharing the same physical site,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes,"The word premises used in the act does not necessarily mean a structure surrounded by four  walls (CUB  20493). It may mean a building and secondary structures, or all  buildings located on the same property.\nA thorough examination of the situation is required in order to  determine whether these are the same premises (EI  Act 36(1)) or whether they are distinct businesses, each of  which should be viewed as a distinct place of employment. The same question  arises when there appear to be different departments or services on the same  premises; the question then is whether each department constitutes a separate  and distinct establishment (EI  Act 36(5))\nThe following elements should be considered :\n\nthe nature of operations within the establishments or departments;\nthe type of work carried out in each establishment or department;\nthe nature of the end products or services rendered;\nthe degree of functional integration and interdependence;\nthe degree of interdependence of management;\nthe physical proximity of the places of employment.\n\nIt is not sufficient to have distinct types of operations being  performed, for example, the work of office employees versus that of plant  employees. The same is true for office work, maintenance, shipping, delivery  and purchasing, all of which are usually only divisions of the same firm.\nIn the end, the test is whether the operation constitutes one or more  distinct businesses. When a firm offers two types of services amounting to  distinct businesses, for example a vending machine and a cafeteria division,  each group of workers is considered to have its own place of employment, even  where the services of each division are provided within the same plant.\nWhen several buildings share a common enclosure, they are generally  considered a single place of employment; on a practical level these structures  are only divisions of the same business. The condition, however, is that the  various branches of operations be elements of one and the same business.\nDepartments that are normally not linked to the same firm could be  considered as separate and distinct businesses. It must be determined whether  the departments actually constitute one and the same business, or if they  should be viewed as distinct businesses.\nThere are numerous examples of cases where various departments sharing a  common geographic site have been considered as distinct businesses. Some  examples are: an electric power plant which was considered a necessity to a  sawmill operation; a pastry business and a bakery; a sawmill and a plywood  plant or a cardboard mill; an oil refinery and the marketing division. But a  smelter and its subsidiary railway and construction operations may be regarded  as a single integrated business, even though they may be legally distinct  entities.\nWhere several operations regarded as different businesses, such as  sawmill, a garage, a dock, a logging camp and a cardboard mill, are all administered  from an office within the mill itself, the office and mill workers are deemed  to work in the same place of employment. An exception may be made for office  employees whose duties are exclusively associated with the logging operations.\nIn another context, a depot located within the same building as the  central administration but associated with plant operations a few kilometres  away was a distinct place of employment. The dispute involving the plant and  depot employees did not exist at the central administration building.\nSometimes, it is not possible to conclude that seasonal repair work is a  distinct operation considering the ordinary operations of the plant, although  on other occasions workers employed by outside contractors, whether on  machinery installation or construction work, may be considered to have distinct  places of employment from plant employees.",0.9616515
512,512,512,"This industry hires many workers in different jobs all over the country. Depending on the situation, workers follow specific agreements or laws that apply to their province. Disputes sometimes happen and can stop work in this important industry and related sectors. When looking at labor disputes, it's not just about conflicts between construction workers and employers across a province, but also if there's a dispute at the particular work site. Each construction site is its own workplace where different contractors work. Even if a contractor doesn't have a dispute with their workers, there could still be a dispute at that site. Even if there's a general industry dispute, each construction site is considered a separate workplace. To figure out if there's a labor dispute, you have to look at what's happening at the entire work site, not just with one employer. Each construction worker's workplace is where they do their job, and it must be clearly identified. If construction is happening where other businesses are located, those are seen as different workplaces. For example, if construction is happening at a factory, it's a separate workplace unless the construction is part of the same big company. Any labor dispute at a business or construction site is limited to that specific location, unless it involves other workers and employers in the same place. Workers can't claim their workplace is the company's main office if they actually work at a construction site. If a construction worker is laid off after a project ends and can't find work elsewhere due to a labor dispute, it's not considered a job loss because of the dispute that happened at a different site.

Their working conditions are governed, depending on the  situation, by distinct collective agreements for each group or by legislation  applying to workers throughout a given province.\nIt is thus not surprising that major disputes have halted operations in  this key sector of the economy and in those to which it is directly related. In  applying the labour dispute provisions of the act, it is not enough to determine that a labour dispute exists  throughout a province between construction employers and employees. It must also  be determined whether the labour dispute actually exists on the site where the  claimant is employed, and this requires an investigation for every single  construction site.\nA construction site is generally considered to consist of all  construction work carried out at a given geographic site. Each construction  site constitutes a distinct place of employment at which a variety of different  contractors or subcontractors are involved at different stages of construction.  Consequently, even when specific contractors have no labour dispute with their  employees, a labour dispute may still exist at their place of employment.\nEven when there is a generalized dispute throughout the industry, the  various construction sites cannot be treated as if they constitute a single  place of employment. There are as many places of employment as there are  construction sites. To determine whether a labour dispute exists, what must be considered  are the events that occur on the work site as a whole and not simply the  specific situation of an individual employer. The place of employment of each  construction worker is the site where the work is performed, and this site must  be clearly identified and defined.\nIf the construction work is located at a site where other businesses in  different fields are carried on, such businesses must be considered as  different places of employment. An example would be construction work carried  out at a plant, unless the work is being performed by a division of a single  large firm. Any labour dispute arising at one of these firms or on the  construction site is thereby confined to the specific place where it arises,  unless events show that it has spread elsewhere because other employees and  employers within the same enclosure are actively involved in the dispute.\nA claimant's place of employment cannot be deemed to be the business  office of the employer from which the firm is managed, because the claimant was  employed at the construction site itself.\nA construction employee laid off after work is completed at a specific  site cannot be considered as having lost employment because of a stoppage of  work attributable to a labour dispute, if work cannot be found at another site  because of the existence of such a stoppage of work. This event has in fact not  taken place at the site where and when the claimant actually worked. The loss  of employment is really due to a shortage of work.",0.9966114

For example, someone unloading saw logs is considered part of the woodlands division where they work, not the nearby sawmill.

There must be a  stoppage of work for the labour dispute provisions to apply (Digest  8.1.3).\nIt is important to be aware that, virtually from day to day, the  application of the labour dispute provisions will depend on the development of  the stoppage of work, and whether it occurred on one or several specific days.  This is very much a day concept, particularly when there are  irregular stoppages of work, for example, during sporadic strikes and rotating  walkouts.\nThe issue is whether a business or a given place of employment are  continuing normal day to day operations, despite the presence of a labour  dispute. This may be difficult to determine when, for example, there is a  work-to-rule, a partial slowdown, or when essential services are being well  maintained.\nEverything depends on what is meant by stoppage of work. It may be that  a stoppage of work takes place once the work that the employer offers and  wishes to have performed is not carried out or completed because some of the  employees have stopped working. But it is much less obvious that there is a  stoppage of work when only one or several employees within a large group of  workers withdraw their services.",0.9991756
518,518,518,"The term ""stoppage of work"" in a labor dispute means when work at a business is disrupted, causing a change in the normal operations or services provided by the business. It's important to note that this stoppage is not just about individual employees' work but about the overall functioning of the business, including production, office tasks, and maintenance.

A stoppage of work can happen due to various reasons such as strikes, slowdowns in production, mass absenteeism, or other forms of work refusal. Even things like layoffs or refusing to work normal hours can contribute to a stoppage of work.

If a labor dispute significantly affects the normal operations of a business, then it's considered a stoppage of work, even if it doesn't affect every employee or department. However, a minor walkout that doesn't have a big impact on the business's operation wouldn't count as a stoppage of work.

In conclusion, a stoppage of work occurs when a labor dispute disrupts the regular activities of a business. It doesn't have to affect everyone in the business, but it must have a noticeable impact on the normal functions of at least a portion of the business.",56.014229060913735,11.564003807106598,12.815532586354998,14.52005076142132,13.16534263959391,10.816040609137058,54.06662436548224,7.25,0.8836182270731244,0.8676619629065195,2.746238219139073,0.4566622959091965,0.4863308804254325,0.0815873669820096,4.730964467005077,4.0,2.827297248203993,24.625,26.0,4.553501400021746,1.487309644670051,1.0,0.7779260274088907,197,96,0.4873096446700508,973,8,8.4.1,Stoppage of work defined,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes,"Since the act does not define  stoppage of work (EI Regulation 53), the term should be given its ordinary  meaning. It should not be confused with labour dispute, of which it is only one  outcome (Digest  8.2.1 and Digest  8.2.2).\nA stoppage of work within the context of a labour dispute cannot be  defined in terms of the work of individual employees, but rather by referring  in general to what constitutes the normal operations of a business (Digest  8.4.2). The latter include not only production departments, but also  office work, maintenance services, and others.\nA stoppage of work refers to a breakdown in the normal operations of a  firm or to a change in the usual delivery of services, as a result of a  reduction in operations and in the number of employees. The fact that  activities continue elsewhere will be of no consequence as it is the activities  at the premises where the claimant worked that are relevant (CUB  15424).\nA stoppage of work does not refer only to a strike or lock-out (CUB  80535). It may also be used to refer to production slowdowns, concerted  refusals of work, mass absenteeism, walkouts, suspensions, dismissals and  shutdowns.\r\n      Even lay-offs resulting from the dispute may be deemed to cause a  stoppage of work or help make a partial stoppage of work more widespread. Other  examples include suspension of the night shift or a refusal to work normal  overtime.\nNot resuming work after a general lay-off or at the beginning of the  active season could also be a sign of a stoppage of work, if it is established  that activities would normally have resumed at a given time. The delay in  resuming the normal activities at a specific moment may be seen as a stoppage  of the normal activity (EI  Act 36; Digest  8.4.3 and Digest  8.5.2).\nTo conclude, the existence of a stoppage of work depends on the impact  of the labour dispute upon the normal operations of the business (Digest  8.11.1). If the dispute has a marked effect on these operations, then there is  a stoppage of work. There is no requirement that this stoppage of work be  generalized throughout the firm (CUB  21211). The stoppage may even be confined to a certain number of  employees, or to a single operation, so long as it has some significant impact  in terms of a slowdown or change of normal operations carried out by this more  limited group of employees (Digest  8.4.2).\nClearly, a walkout that has only a negligible impact on the operation of  a group does not meet this definition of stoppage of work. However, it would be  very difficult for claimants who willingly participate in this partial strike to  prove they are unable to find suitable work. Such situations may arise, for  example, during the period preceding a generalized stoppage of work.",0.99825674
519,519,519,"When there is a disagreement between workers and their employer, it doesn't always mean that all work stops right away. There are usually negotiations and events happening before a decision is made. 

In these situations, the reduction in work happening at a business is a key factor in determining if there is a work stoppage. This reduction can be seen in the entire business, a specific group of workers, a single department, or even just in a specific task. Even if a specific group of workers stops working, it might not affect the whole business greatly. 

Two main factors are typically used to decide if there is a work stoppage. One is the quality and quantity of goods and services being produced. Even if production levels seem normal, a decrease in quality can still signal a work stoppage. Another factor is the number of employees working. The number of employees is usually related to production levels. 

To decide if there is a work stoppage, factors like production levels and the number of employees are compared to what would be normal without the disagreement. If these numbers drop significantly, there might be a work stoppage. 

When trying to decide if a work stoppage has ended, regulations come into play. If the number of employees working and the production levels are at least 85% of what is normal, then the work stoppage is considered over. If not, then the work stoppage continues. 

There might be situations where special measures are taken to keep work going even during a disagreement. In these cases, it's important to look at what would have happened without these measures to determine if a work stoppage truly occurred.",69.89461300309598,7.675252837977297,10.590485417798838,10.776057791537667,9.180247678018578,10.183859649122804,42.37874097007224,4.294117647058823,0.8462248742580414,0.8360752503077189,2.477881056239818,0.4042816230711038,0.4578602863511145,0.0628848169192526,4.719298245614035,4.0,2.6711873039537943,16.764705882352942,16.0,5.8262025950185325,1.4175438596491228,1.0,0.709119247888149,285,122,0.4280701754385965,1381,17,8.4.2,Scope of work stoppage,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes,"The existence of a labour dispute does not necessarily imply a sudden  halt to all operations of a business, without prior signs. There may be several  measures and events related to negotiations and the willingness of the parties  to reach a concrete agreement.\nNowhere in the act is  there any standard that measures a stoppage of work or its scope to determine if  it fits the definition. The approach generally adopted has been that there be  an appreciable reduction in the normal operations of a business before reaching  any conclusion that a stoppage of work exists within the terms of the labour  dispute provisions.\nReference has often been made to the business as a whole in order to  measure this reduction in operations; however, at other times this has been  confined only to employees on strike, to a single department or service within  a firm, or to employees of a single bargaining unit (FCA  A-340-79, CUB  12992A). A dispute between the employer and a specific group of  workers can disrupt the activities of this group and yet not significantly  affect the operations of the business as a whole. This does not mean that there  is no stoppage of work.  Rather, a total  stoppage of work or a marked reduction in work in any major department of a  firm constitutes a stoppage of work, no matter whether this involves production  or support services, such as administration or maintenance. This may be the  case even if a single activity within a department is interrupted, or if other  operations of the business continue more or less normally, despite the stoppage  of work.\nDepending on whether or not the dispute and stoppage of work have  repercussions on the entire firm or only on specific operations, the reduction  in operations attributable to the dispute can be measured against the entire  firm, or only those operations affected by the labour dispute.\nAmong the many indicators that can individually reflect a business's  level of operations, there are two main ones that have been established and  used historically to determine whether a stoppage of work has occurred. First is  the production of goods and services in terms of both quality and quantity.  Even if, from a quantitative standpoint, a near-normal production level is  maintained, there is still a stoppage of work if there is an appreciable  decline in quality (CUB  69099C).\nThe number of employees still at work is the second determining factor.  Although it is not the sole and absolute test, it generally corresponds to the  level of production. The level of income of the business, however, is not an  element to be considered.\nThere is clearly a significant reduction in the normal activity where  the production of goods or services has completely ceased or where there are no  longer any employees at work. However, how does one judge the situation where  the presence of a dispute influences the drop in production or in the number of  employees at work, but there is not yet a total interruption. What must be  determined is when exactly the reduction in the normal activities that  corresponds to a stoppage of work, occurred.\nSimilarly, it must later be determined whether there is a termination in  the stoppage of work. What must be considered in either case, is the level of  employees at work and the level of the production of goods and services of a  business or a group of workers, and not what their normal level would be, had  there not been a labour dispute and a stoppage of work.\nThe regulations that define what constitutes the termination of the  stoppage of work should be used to resolve the question of when the stoppage of  work occurs and continues. The stoppage of work ends, according to the  regulation, when the number of employees at work and the activities in respect  of the production of goods and services represent at least 85% of their normal  level (Digest  8.11.1). If this minimum of 85% is not attained in one or the other case,  the stoppage of work continues to exist.\nWhen determining the start of the stoppage of work, the reverse of the 85%  rule (i.e., a reduction of more than 15% of the work force or activities), is  one factor that can be used.  This  factor, however, should not be systematically applied. There must be  flexibility in its application, as, in any given situation, there are  indicators which reveal an appreciable stoppage of work, such as a significant  reduction in the production of goods or services or in the number of employees  at work, as compared to the normal situation.\nThere may be occasions, however, whether, due to exceptional or  temporary measures that, in spite of the dispute, the employer maintains or  resumes a normal level in terms of the number of employees at work or in the  activities related to the production of goods or services. What must then be  determined is what the actual situation would have been without these  exceptional or temporary measures. It may be concluded that a stoppage of work  occurred in the case where, in the absence of such, there would have been a  significant reduction in the number of employees or in the activities related  to the production of goods or services, when compared to the normal situation.",0.99276614
520,520,520,"The word ""attributable"" in the Act means that there is a cause-and-effect relationship between a labor dispute and a work stoppage. If there is a dispute at someone's workplace due to others places of work, it doesn't count unless it affects the claimant's workplace directly. If multiple places of work are involved in a dispute, each stoppage must be proved separately. A strike or lockout is directly linked to a labor dispute, even if other factors are involved. When a work stoppage happens during a labor dispute, it is assumed to be related to the dispute unless proven otherwise. Even if the work stoppage is caused by something else like the business shutting down for reasons not related to the dispute, it can still be connected to the dispute. If there are rumors of a strike leading to layoffs and subsequently a work stoppage, it is considered linked to the dispute. Sometimes, absenteeism or acts of vandalism during a dispute are not separate from the dispute itself. If there are multiple reasons for a work stoppage, it is important to determine if the dispute is the main cause. If a new event becomes the main cause of the stoppage, like a fire or a natural disaster, then it is no longer attributed to the dispute.",68.24083640552999,9.131986175115204,9.3871,10.891981566820276,10.90801843317972,9.66175115207373,50.27142857142857,6.2,0.890306638346778,0.8950247317552567,2.714342191372985,0.2768418954567644,0.4357830960772746,0.0418995599694865,4.56221198156682,4.0,2.635638537213064,21.7,21.5,4.382921400162226,1.3778801843317972,1.0,0.6332340547796564,217,96,0.4423963133640553,1021,10,8.4.3,Cause-and-effect relationship between labour dispute and stoppage of work,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes,"The word attributable inserted between stoppage of  work and labour dispute (EI  Act 36(1))  in the act was added to establish  a cause-and-effect relationship between a labour dispute and a stoppage of  work. The labour dispute provisions specifically contemplate a stoppage of work  as a direct result of a labour dispute.\nIn addition to the fact that a stoppage of work cannot exist without its  cause (FCA A-354-79, CUB  5193B; FCA  A-512-88, CUB  12992A), this relationship must also exist at the claimant's  actual place of employment. A stoppage of work due to a dispute at another  place of employment does not meet this condition unless that dispute has also  resulted in a dispute at the claimant's own place of employment (CUB  20493 and CUB  16592).\nWhen there is a generalized dispute at several places of employment, for  example, in the construction industry or in public transit, the stoppage of  work must be distinctly established for each place of employment. The stoppages  may occur at different dates depending on the actual situation at each of these  places. The fact that it is one and the same dispute does not change that.\nWhen a stoppage of work arises during a labour dispute, the  cause-and-effect relationship is a logical deduction unless some other  explanation for the situation can be proven. In the case of an employer who  indicates they will temporarily close the business if such a cause-and-effect  relation is established, this clearly supports that the stoppage of work was a  direct result of a labour dispute.\nThis relationship is all the more obvious when the stoppage of work  takes the form of a strike or lockout; by its very nature, this type of event  is directly linked to the existence of a labour dispute. The fact that a  lockout was declared the day before the employer shut down operations, only to  reopen two days later with a reduced labour force, does not change this  relationship. Other forms of stoppages of work are also attributable to a  labour dispute where the stoppage results from earlier negotiations; however,  the lack of negotiations is not a crucial factor.\nThe link between the stoppage of work and the dispute need not be  direct, so long as the stoppage of work can be said to be an event related to  the dispute or that, had there been no dispute, the stoppage of work would not  have occurred. The latter is true even when the stoppage of work is provoked by  others, and not by the employees or the employer.\nWithout formally denying the existence of a labour dispute, some have  linked work stoppages to causes unrelated to the dispute: the economic  situation, the impending move of the business, overproduction, seasonal market  fluctuations, weather and even natural disasters. As is always the case, the  relevant facts must be examined in reaching a decision; there is no issue with claims  where it is established that, had there been no dispute, the firm would still have  shut down (Digest  8.11.3 and Digest  8.11.4). But it is important to keep in mind that in many disputes not  everyone plays by the rules. With action and reaction, demand and resistance,  threat and counter-threat, it is always appropriate to ask where reality  actually begins, and on what objective and undisputed facts conclusions can be  based (CUB  21211). The mere fact that an employer takes advantage of a  stoppage of work to prepare to move operations or to make renovations is not  conclusive.\nSome may claim that the stoppage of work was caused by lay-offs  resulting from a shortage of work. It is important to go beyond the events  themselves, and clarify whether the shortage of work resulted from the labour  dispute, or if lay-offs would have taken place regardless. When rumours of a  strike result in fewer orders and thus provoke numerous lay-offs, the resulting  stoppage of work is deemed to be attributable to the dispute.\r\n      Generalized absenteeism under the pretext of illness is sometimes used  as a strategy during a labour dispute. Similarly, the claim that a stoppage of  work was provoked by acts of vandalism is of no help where the sabotage is  attributable to the dispute.\nWhen there are two causes for the stoppage of work, the issue then is  whether the dispute is the principal cause. Generally a subsequent event will  not change the cause-and-effect relationship between the dispute and the  original cause of the stoppage of work, unless the dispute becomes of secondary  importance. This subsequent event then becomes the principal cause of the  stoppage of work; examples include fires or natural disasters. Even if it is  established that the original cause of the stoppage of work had nothing to do  with the dispute, the fact that, because of a dispute, there is a delay in the  return to work following a period of lay-off or at the beginning of the season,  constitutes a stoppage of work attributable to the dispute (Digest 8.4.1 and Digest  8.5.2; CUB  80780).",0.9882733

That is, to determine whether the claimant has lost employment or is unable to resume an employment because of this stoppage of work.\nDespite its apparent complexity, this issue is not difficult to address.

When there's a disagreement between an employer and employee that leads to work being stopped, both parties usually want to resolve it to get things back on track. Laws protect employees in these situations, ensuring they have the right to return to work when things start up again. 

Losing a job can also happen if you're bumped out due to seniority or if your work is postponed, even if you find another job right away. The government considers all the jobs you held when a work stoppage occurred, regardless of how many jobs you had. This includes jobs you planned to start but couldn't because of the work stoppage. 

However, the government's rules only apply to jobs that meet certain criteria, like having a boss. Self-employment doesn't count.

This does not mean that an interruption of less than seven consecutive days is not a loss of employment. The terms used and the reasons invoked make little difference, whether in respect of a strike, leaving or failing to show up for work, refusal to cross the picket line, lock-out, or suspension.\nIn these circumstances, there is no denying that the employer-employee relationship may be affected by the existence of a dispute, especially if it evolves into a stoppage of work. Usually there is not a total breakdown in relations between the parties. In principle, each has an interest in reaching some common ground that may produce an eventual solution to the dispute. Most provincial codes as well as the Canada Labour Code include specific provisions guaranteeing the employee's right, with precedence over any other individual, to return to work when operations start up again.\nFew stoppages of work amount to a permanent separation between the parties, in the form of resignation, dismissal or even lay-off, arising prior to or after the start of a stoppage of work, or even once the stoppage of work has ended (Digest 8.5.5, Digest 8.5.6 and Digest 8.13.0).\nLoss of employment may also result from bumping based on years of seniority, or postponing work to a later date, even where the total time worked according to the collective agreement is eventually honoured (FCA A-1415-84, CUB 9598). The fact that another job has been found immediately does not mean there has been no loss of employment.\nThe wording of the legislation relating to labour disputes (EI Act 36(1)) requires that the loss of every employment the claimant held at the time of the stoppage of work, be taken into account.  This is the case regardless of whether the claimant was working at more than one job at the time their employment was lost, or if employment was continued in other jobs afterwards. This also includes employment that a claimant expected to start with a new employer at a definite date, but could not start because of a stoppage of work attributable to a labour dispute. The wording applies to all previous employment that the claimant was unable to resume, for the same reason (Digest 8.5.2).\nThe employment at issue must nonetheless meet the definition found in the legislation (EI Act 2(1)), which effectively eliminates self-employment, as there is no employer-employee relationship. As long as this employment falls within the definition, it may also include any employment worked in Canada or overseas, as well as employment that does not meet the minimum conditions regarding insurability.",0.9108156
523,523,523,"The law says that if someone can't go back to work because of a labor dispute, they might not get employment benefits. This applies if the person was on leave for a while (like vacation, sickness, or maternity leave) and couldn't return to work because of the ongoing dispute. 

It can be tricky to figure out if someone can't go back to work because of union activities, or if they're casual or seasonal workers waiting to be called back. The law needed to be clearer about who might be affected by labor disputes.

If someone is away for a long time, like doing union work or working somewhere else, we need to see if they can't go back to their job because of the situation. This also applies to people who can't return to work after being laid off or when their contract ends.

Being ""unable to resume employment"" means not being able to go back to a job the person had in the past, even if it was a while ago and not the last job they had. It must be with the same employer, even if it's not the same job or location.

It's important to remember that being ""unable to resume employment"" includes both people who can't go back to work because of a labor dispute and those who choose not to return to work.",68.73275862068967,10.87689655172414,10.686352973137792,14.013793103448275,12.09271551724138,6.927413793103444,44.94827586206897,4.625,0.8263830883162362,0.8831338187058767,3.370324411257169,0.6955237532704105,0.458883896346862,0.0595295237980041,4.038793103448276,4.0,2.1077145471733667,29.0,29.0,11.683321445547923,1.2844827586206895,1.0,0.5694224915128184,232,104,0.4482758620689655,985,8,8.5.2,Unable to resume an employment,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes,"Because the specific phrase a claimant . . . unable to resume an employment, because of a work stoppage attributable to a labour dispute appears in the legislation (EI Act 36(1)), this claimant is subject to the provisions concerning labour disputes.\nAccordingly a claimant, on leave when the stoppage occurred, who could not, after a period of vacation, illness, injury or maternity, resume their employment because the stoppage of work continued, would be connected to the loss of employment attributable to the stoppage of work. The disentitlement, should it apply, would be effective the date the claimant was to have returned to work (CUB 21571and CUB 20347).\nThe connection may be more difficult to find in cases where a claimant is not able to resume employment after a leave of absence for union business (FCA A-661-83, CUB 8639). Similar issues may arise between casual workers who are subject to recall, and seasonal workers. (FCA A-787-81, CUB 6801; FCA -1036-92, CUB 21236; and FCA A-549-81, CUB 6827). These claimants do not literally lose employment at the beginning of the active season but, rather, the possibility of employment.\nIn order to eliminate all the ambiguity as to whether the provisions concerning labour disputes applied in a claimant's situation, it was necessary to add a specific reference to a claimant . . . who is unable to resume an employment in the legislation (EI Act 36(1)). This establishes an equitable treatment of a claimant who has lost employment and a claimant who is unable to resume employment, when both are for the same reasons.\nWith respect to situations where the leave is of a longer duration, for example, for union business or working at another job, it is more appropriate to consider the question whether the claimant is unable to resume an employment. This approach should also be used where a claimant is unable to resume an employment on return or recall to work after a lay-off or at the end of a contract. The same could be said for the casual or seasonal worker whose return to work is prevented by the fact that there is a stoppage of work attributable to a labour dispute (Digest 8.5.8).\nThis does not mean that all persons who have a possibility of being recalled by the employer during a stoppage of work automatically fall under the category of claimants who are unable to resume an employment. At the outset it must be reasonably concluded that, had it not been for the stoppage of work, the employer would have taken these workers back at a given date or time, and consequently, in the absence of the stoppage of work, these workers would have been at their jobs. However, an unconfirmed possibility or non-assurance of working, or the sole existence of a right of recall, is not sufficient to arrive at such a conclusion.\nThe employment to which we refer must be an employment that the claimant held in the past, regardless of whether it is in the recent or distant past. It is not limited in any way to the employment that the claimant held immediately prior to their last employment or prior to the filing of their claim for benefits. This expression may even refer to an employment at which, for one reason or another, the claimant has stopped working during the benefit period, and did not later resume because of a stoppage of work due to a labour dispute.\nIt must however be in respect of the same employer for whom the claimant has already held employment, but not necessarily in the same occupation or even the same place of employment. The fact that a claimant could not, because of the stoppage of work, commence a job at a date provided by an employer, for whom they have never worked, does not fall within this category. What would be more at issue there, is whether the loss of employment would be subject to the labour dispute provisions.\nFinally, it must be emphasized that a claimant who . . . is unable to resume an employment also includes those persons who are prevented from resuming their employment because of a stoppage of work, as well as those who decide, voluntarily, not to resume their employment.",0.98974764
524,524,524,"Events in everyday life can be connected in a chain reaction known as the domino effect. This is when one event leads to another and then another. The labour dispute clause works in a similar way, linking together a labour dispute, work stoppage, and loss of employment or the inability to return to work. 

A work stoppage refers to when a business's normal activities are halted, usually due to a strike or lockout. If someone loses their job or can't return to work, it must be directly related to the work stoppage for it to qualify under the labour dispute clause.

If someone loses their job before the work stoppage, they are not covered by the labour dispute provisions. However, if a person is on leave during a work stoppage and can't return to work when the leave ends, it is considered a loss of employment due to the work stoppage.

Determining the status of a casual worker during a work stoppage can be tricky and depends on their job history. If an employee is reinstated after a work stoppage, any change in their job status must be taken into account when considering their loss of employment.

If an employee's job was set to end after a work stoppage for reasons unrelated to the dispute, or if they were given notice of dismissal during the stoppage, the relationship between their job loss and the work stoppage stays the same until their employment is permanently terminated.",61.62656024096388,10.8495140562249,11.979248473330829,13.815421686746989,12.319036144578313,9.601124497991968,47.79156626506024,5.7,0.8919217586517334,0.8760119080543518,2.937531710917868,0.552178143366715,0.462273446200931,0.0620937115331583,4.522088353413655,4.0,2.507921997832818,24.9,23.5,10.044401425669925,1.4176706827309238,1.0,0.7072835329398014,249,111,0.4457831325301205,1157,10,8.5.3,Loss of or unable to resume employment because of a stoppage of work,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes,"Many events in everyday life are linked by what is called the domino effect, a kind of chain reaction by which one-event causes a second, which creates a third. The labour dispute clause has a similar effect with respect to three events: labour dispute, stoppage of work and loss of employment or being unable to resume an employment (Digest 8.1.3).\nThe term work stoppage does not refer to the employees' labour, but rather to the employer's operations (CUB 16553). A work stoppage means a stoppage of the normal activity of the employer's business.  The stoppage of work may be caused by a strike or lockout, which may be legal or illegal.  The Commission has the burden to show that there was a work stoppage.  A permanent closure of the business is not a work stoppage attributable to a labour dispute.\nLoss of employment or being unable to resume an employment, and a stoppage of work do not necessarily take place at the same time. Following the reasoning inherent in the labour dispute clause, this loss or inability to resume employment within the meaning of that clause must occur following the commencement of the stoppage of work, or must at the very least coincide with it. The issue then is whether this loss or inability follows an event associated with the dispute and the stoppage of work (CUB 39840 and CUB 21211) or whether it would not have occurred at that specific time, had there not been a stoppage of work (CUB 76451 and CUB 56343). In either case, it is reasonable to conclude that a cause-and-effect relationship between these events indeed exists. Whether the relationship is direct or indirect is not relevant.\nWhile the situation is far less clear when loss of employment or being unable to resume an employment precedes the stoppage of work, an effect cannot precede its cause. Consequently, a claimant who lost employment or was unable to resume it prior to a stoppage of work is not covered by the labour dispute provisions (EI Act 27, EI Act 28, EI Act 29; Digest 8.5.5 and Digest 8.5.6). Whether or not the loss of employment or being unable to resume it can be blamed on an imminent stoppage of work is not relevant.\nEmployees are often on leave at the time of a stoppage of work. Relations with the employer are not definitively broken in such circumstances, even if the leave is unpaid. A person who is unable to return to work once the leave ends is considered to have lost an employment, or is unable to resume an employment because of a stoppage of work, if the stoppage is still in progress (Digest 8.5.2 and Digest 8.5.7).\nSometimes an employee's status at the time of the stoppage of work can be difficult to determine. The case of a full or part-time employee, working on a temporary, permanent or probationary basis, generally poses no real problem. There is a clear link between the loss of employment or being unable to resume an employment, and the stoppage of work for the period the employee would have remained at work, had such stoppage of work not taken place.\nThe situation of a casual worker is much less clear. This situation must be determined in terms of the job history and the likelihood of continuing at the job had there been no stoppage of work (Digest 8.5.12).\nFor an employee who is reinstated in the job following a grievance, the fact that the employee's status at the time of the stoppage of work was not known until several months following the stoppage is not relevant. Consequently, the ruling on loss of employment must be reconsidered in light of the new status, even if the claimant is not aware of this fact until after the stoppage of work (CUB 16582).\nAn employee whose job was scheduled to come to an end after the commencement of the stoppage of work for reasons unrelated to the dispute may be in a similar situation as an employee who has received final notice of dismissal effective after the beginning of the stoppage of work. The relationship between the initial loss of employment and the stoppage of work remains unchanged (FCA A-181-83, CUB 7842A;  FCA A-270-91, CUB 19037) until such time as the employer-employee relationship is permanently severed  (FCA A-942-85, CUB 11403 and FCA A-1036-92, CUB 21236; Digest 8.13.0).",0.9909566
525,525,525,"Labor disputes can get complicated when more than one group is involved, like an employer and different local unions. Sometimes there are multiple disputes happening at the same workplace. Each negotiation for a collective agreement counts as a separate dispute. For example, if both blue-collar and white-collar workers are negotiating with the employer and the blue-collar workers go on strike which leads to some white-collar workers being laid off, there could be considered two separate disputes. If the white-collar workers were laid off due to the blue-collar strike, they might be able to qualify for certain benefits. However, if the employer locks out the white-collar workers after the blue-collar strike, it becomes harder for the white-collar workers to qualify for those benefits because now there are two separate disputes happening.",55.5078836930456,11.272338129496404,12.745084868956482,14.15875299760192,13.804988009592329,12.449208633093528,51.2242206235012,6.5,0.8195020318031311,0.8131466954946518,2.90279184960036,0.7473406066328502,0.4509123658059828,0.0312986804274561,5.0215827338129495,5.0,2.345875382006324,23.166666666666668,21.0,11.451588924201255,1.5107913669064748,1.0,0.771496783795943,139,79,0.5683453237410072,719,6,8.5.4,Multiple disputes or stoppages,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes,"Several factors may complicate a labour dispute, including the number of parties actually involved. This often happens when a dispute involves an employer or an association of employers and several locals of the same union or even several unions. The first issue is to determine whether one or several disputes are underway at the claimant's place of employment.\nGenerally, there are as many labour disputes as there are collective agreements under negotiation. There is a single dispute when the major issues relate to a master collective agreement, when negotiations deal with the industry as a whole or when various groups of workers form a common front, creating for example a joint committee or even making the signing of each collective agreement an essential condition for the settlement of every dispute (FCA A-512-88, CUB 12992A; FCA A-814-91, CUB 20138). Where there is more than one dispute at the claimant's place of employment, the impact of each stoppage of work on the loss of employment or being unable to resume an employment in question must be identified.\nWhen several unions are locked out by an employer, the resulting stoppage of work may be attributable to all of the disputes, and not simply to a single dispute (CUB 67605, CUB 39832A, and CUB 25474). The fact that one union is responsible for the event that brought about the lockout, or that this event occurred at another place of work, is of little importance.\nThe situation can be illustrated where blue and white-collar workers are negotiating with the same employer for the renewal of their respective collective agreements. To back up their demands, the blue-collar workers go on strike, and this results in some of the white-collar workers being laid off. It is necessary at this stage to decide if there is one complex dispute, in which both white and blue-collar workers are involved, or two distinct labour disputes. The question is important, specifically because the exempting conditions apply only with respect to the dispute which resulted in the work stoppage, and led to some white-collar workers being laid off.\nIn this situation, there are clearly two labour disputes involved.  If the employer locked out the white-collar workers a few weeks after the blue-collar workers launched their own strike, the lay-offs of the white-collar workers prior to the lockout are considered to have been caused by the blue-collar strike, and therefore fall under the labour dispute provisions (EI Act 36(1)). The white-collar workers in this case lost, or may have been unable to resume their employment due to a stoppage of work attributable to a labour dispute of blue-collar workers. However, if it can be shown that they were not concerned with that labour dispute those white-collar workers would likely not have any difficulty meeting the exempting conditions (EI Act 36(4)).\nThe situation would be different if the employer, equally in dispute with the white-collar workers, decides to lock them out. From that point on, it would be considered that the white-collar workers, who had earlier been laid off, could not resume their employment due to a stoppage of work attributable to two labour disputes in progress. In this context it becomes more difficult for these white-collar workers to prove that they continue to meet the exempting conditions, as they have become parties to the labour dispute.",0.9980459
526,526,526,"When employees are laid off or their return to work is canceled and it's due to reasons unrelated to a dispute, it's just a coincidence and not covered by labor dispute rules. But if the lay-off or cancellation is because of a labor dispute that might lead to a work stoppage, then it's considered part of the dispute.

The labor dispute rules consider the connection between events like layoffs and work stoppages, even if the stoppage hasnâ€™t happened yet. The time gap between a layoff and a work stoppage, and whether a strike mandate has been given, can show if a work stoppage is on the way. If a work stoppage occurs, employees might lose benefits.

If a layoff or cancellation of work return happens for multiple reasons and one is related to an impending work stoppage, it's important to determine if the imminent stoppage is the main reason. The rules of the labor dispute are strict to avoid any confusion if someone loses their job before or during a stoppage.

When there are mass layoffs or cancellations of work returns before a work stoppage, the labor dispute rules apply, even if the job loss happened before the actual stoppage. If an employee is suspended before a work stoppage due to dispute-related activities, the rules apply after the suspension ends.

If an employee is permanently fired before a work stoppage, the labor dispute rules usually don't apply. But if the employee is rehired after resolving a complaint, the rules apply retroactively from the start of the work stoppage.",62.66574614065184,10.503567753001716,11.389717465364855,13.108061749571185,12.281454545454544,10.019320754716976,50.50600343053173,6.363636363636363,0.9059529840946198,0.8995313776863946,2.7985598800062337,0.4540493199158207,0.4536562504427162,0.0487973106151683,4.6,4.0,2.605943858993592,24.09090909090909,23.0,6.501112428647682,1.4150943396226414,1.0,0.7013184958415609,265,112,0.4226415094339623,1255,11,8.5.5,Lay-off prior to stoppage of work,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes,"The fact that a dispute is underway and a stoppage of work is imminent, when the lay-off of one or several employees takes place, may be due simply to chance and be unrelated to the lay-off. It may be the same when an employer cancels the fixed recall of a number of employees. These cases are not subject to the labour dispute provisions.\nThe same cannot be said when the lay-off or the cancellation of a recall is attributable to the existence of a labour dispute and to signs of an impending stoppage of work. This relationship may be the result of outside factors, such as a breach of the contract or postponement of orders by customers who fear that, given the circumstances, these will not be completed within deadlines, or who support a boycott organized by the union. Or it may be the result of internal considerations, in reaction to initiatives taken by workers, such as a work slowdown, or in anticipation of operational problems following an intentional damage of equipment. It is not unusual in these situations for employees to be suspended or dismissed because of their involvement in such incidents, even prior to the stoppage of work occurring (Digest 7.3.0).\nAlthough the wording of the labour dispute provisions (EI Act 36(1)) refers specifically to loss of employment or being unable to resume it as a result of a stoppage of work, the interpretation historically followed has been that these provisions may apply in anticipation of a stoppage of work. It is enough to show a cause-and-effect relationship between either of these events and the stoppage of work, even if this is only impending.\nThe numbers of days between the lay-off or cancellation of a recall, and the stoppage of work, as well as the fact that a strike mandate has been given to the union executive, may be signs of an anticipated work stoppage. The eventuality of such a stoppage of work in the short term may well prompt an employer to lay-off or to cancel the recall or return to work of some or all of their employees. The shorter the interval between the lay-off or cancellation of recall and the stoppage of work, the more likely it is that these events are linked to the stoppage of work. It is imperative that the stoppage of work actually take place in order for a claimant to be disentitled from benefits.  If a disentitlement applies, it cannot take effect until the first day of the stoppage of work. When the lay-off or cancellation of the recall has two originating causes, the issue is whether or not the imminence of the stoppage of work is the principal one.\nThis approach is clearly supported by the strict wording of the labour dispute clause (FCA A-0595-00, CUB 45670A; CUB 76451 and CUB 56343). Consistent application of the labour dispute provisions avoids a double standard, depending on whether a worker lost employment or is unable to resume it immediately before or after a stoppage of work.\nJurisprudence has held that the timing of events is important; an actual stoppage of work is essential and must precede or coincide with the loss of employment referred to by the labour dispute provisions (CUB 9830A). This may be significant where the lay-off occurs for a reason related to an employee's specific situation. In this context, the claimant who is permanently laid off, as an isolated incident prior to the stoppage of work, with no chance of recall, will not be considered to have lost employment because of the stoppage of work. The fact that the loss of employment was caused by the impending stoppage of work has no effect on entitlement to benefits in these circumstances. The same principle may be applied in the case of the claimant whose return to work with an employer on a fixed date was permanently cancelled, with no hope of returning, due to the imminent stoppage of work.\nPrecedence is generally given to the interpretation applied in most judgments, especially in cases where there are mass lay-offs or cancellations of recalls before a stoppage of work. Usually these employees are involved or implicated in the labour dispute. The application of the labour dispute provisions cannot automatically be ignored, simply because the loss of employment or being unable to resume it precedes the stoppage of work. The finality of the lay-offs or cancellation of recall, as well as each individual's situation, must be carefully considered.\nWhere an employee is suspended prior to the stoppage of work for activities connected with the dispute, or for other reasons, this loss of employment cannot be considered definitive. The provisions of the labour dispute clause would apply, but only from the end of the suspension period.  This is because it is at that moment that the loss of employment is considered to be a result of the stoppage of work caused by the dispute.\nThere is general agreement that based on what has been said above, it is inappropriate to apply the labour dispute provisions to a permanent dismissal that occurred before the stoppage of work. This is not the case when, after settlement of a grievance, an employee is reinstated and all rights are recognized retroactively. The labour dispute provisions apply in this case from the beginning of the stoppage of work in the same way as they do to all employees, even if the claimant's status as an employee was actually only defined several months later  (CUB 16582).",0.9945634
527,527,527,"Leaving a job on your own is different from being laid off because when you leave your job, you make the choice to end your connection with your employer. This is different from when an employer tells you to leave. The same thing happens if you decide you don't want to return to work on a specific date.

If you choose to quit your job or not go back to work while there is a disagreement at work, this decision could be because of the disagreement or for other personal reasons. In some cases, the disagreement at work should not be considered when thinking about the reasons for your decision.

Thinking that there might be a long disagreement at work can make you make decisions about your future. For example, you might choose to quit your job before the disagreement starts because you think the disagreement will last a long time, you don't agree with what the union is asking for, or you want to go back to school.

Once you've left your job for good, whether it's because you thought there would be a disagreement at work or for another reason, you are no longer an employee of that company. If you leave before a disagreement starts, you can't later say you lost your job because of the disagreement. This is because you chose to leave before the disagreement happened.

Just because benefits won't be denied because of these rules, it doesn't mean you'll automatically get benefits if you leave your job. Other rules must be followed to decide if you should get benefits, like if you had a good reason to leave your job or if you meet all the conditions to get benefits.

It's important to know the difference between leaving your job for a real reason and leaving as part of a plan related to a disagreement at work. If you genuinely quit your job, you've completely cut ties with your employer. This means you can't later join a strike. However, if you leave as part of a plan related to a disagreement at work, you might not get benefits.

It's not right to use benefits to help employees who are on strike or involved in a disagreement. If you leave your job because you think there will be a disagreement at work but you haven't completely cut ties with your employer, you won't get benefits. This also applies if you don't go back to your job for the same reasons.",74.82692211526442,8.32711338917365,11.101131339891392,12.378597324665584,9.753151643955498,7.962375296912118,39.73509188648581,3.8947368421052633,0.8454660144117143,0.837947898051318,2.7821973178686368,0.4417090368313046,0.4464321532694709,0.0814060135079168,4.268408551068884,4.0,2.490204006623998,22.157894736842103,20.0,8.815435970917191,1.294536817102138,1.0,0.6269434102200715,421,147,0.3491686460807601,1873,19,8.5.6,Voluntarily leaving prior to stoppage,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes,"Voluntarily leaving a job is not the same as a lay-off, as it is the claimant who takes the initiative to break the links with the employer; the break is not dictated or imposed by the employer. The same may be said when a person decides not to go back to work at a given date.\nA claimant's voluntary decision to quit employment or not to resume employment while a labour dispute is underway, or when a stoppage of work seems imminent, may be motivated by the stoppage of work or by totally independent reasons. In the latter case the labour dispute provisions should not be considered in ruling on these reasons.\nThe threat of a potentially lengthy labour dispute may lead a claimant to make certain decisions with respect to their future, based on an evaluation of the situation, personal criteria, and the claimant's position within the firm. For example, a claimant may voluntarily resign or not resume an employment prior to the stoppage of work because they believe that the strike will last a long time, they do not support the union demands, or they wish to return to studies.\nWhether the decision to voluntarily leave employment was made in anticipation of a stoppage of work, or for other reasons, one thing is for certain: after this definitive resignation, the claimant is no longer an employee of the firm. It cannot later be said that employment was lost or not resumed because of a stoppage of work attributed to a labour dispute.  This is because the employment has already been deliberately lost or not resumed, even if it was in anticipation of a stoppage of work (FCA A-1082-84).  The labour dispute provisions would not apply.\nAlthough if may appear that this approach is inconsistent with the provisions of the legislation, the fact that benefits will not be denied based on these provisions does not necessarily mean that benefits will in fact be paid to a claimant in this situation.  Other provisions of the legislation must be applied in making the final determination regarding entitlement to benefits, including, but not limited to whether just cause exists for voluntarily leaving employment, or whether all qualifying and entitlement conditions are met.\nA distinction must be made between loss of employment resulting from a genuine resignation and one that could be considered a fabricated departure.  The former is a case of a genuine individual resignation which amounts to a complete and permanent break in the employer-employee relationship. There is no risk that benefits the claimant might receive would influence the claimant's behaviour in the dispute. By totally changing their status, these individuals can never become strikers. They may thus avoid the provisions relating to labour disputes, however, whether they will actually receive benefits would be considered under the provisions of voluntary quitting or refusal to resume work (EI Act 29(1)).\nIn the case of a fabricated departure, the resignation may be reversible because the employer-employee relationship is not totally broken; either the employee has not yet taken that final step, or the break is only superficial in that the employee is involved in picketing or other union activities. The same is true for mass resignations, which are usually only one of several pressure tactics used against the employer to force the granting of demands. The employees' interests remain linked to the future of the business.\nEI benefits should in no way be used to assist employees who are on strike or who have an interest in the dispute. In this context, the traditional approach continues to be justified in that the claimant has clearly left employment because of an impending stoppage of work without, however, breaking all links with the employer. It is the same when the claimant, voluntarily, and for these same reasons, does not resume a previous employment, without definitively breaking all links with the employer. Disentitlement to benefits takes effect from the first day of the stoppage of work, provided of course that such a stoppage actually begins.\nLoss of employment that occurs between a claimant's fabricated resignation (one that is actually linked to a labour dispute), and the start of a stoppage of work which may never occur, could be considered under the provisions of disqualification under section 27(1)(a), (b) of the act. A worker who voluntarily fails to report for work on a day to day basis because of a dispute and impending stoppage of work would have difficulty proving they are unable to find suitable employment.  Because employment is available with the employer and this worker chose not to take it, the issue to consider is the individual's availability for work. A disentitlement pursuant to section 18(a) of the act would likely be justified for as long as the employee fails to show up for work, until the stoppage of work occurs (EI Act 36). This principle also applies to the claimant, who voluntarily does not resume an employment for the same reasons, without definitively breaking all links with the employer.\nThe labour dispute provisions will not apply to those who can show that they have truly resigned their employment by completely separating from the employer, before the start of the stoppage of work. In the case of a fabricated or non-permanent separation, the claimant will be disentitled because of a failure to prove availability during the period from the date they leave employment, until the start of the stoppage of work.",0.98871326
528,528,528,"The rules about work disputes usually don't affect employees who are on leave when the work stoppage happens. This exemption lasts until the day the employee was supposed to come back to work if there hadn't been a stoppage of work. If an employee loses their job or can't go back to work because of the stoppage, this only counts from the day they were supposed to return. If the employee was laid off for a different reason while on leave, this rule doesn't apply. This same rule applies to different types of leave like sickness, injury, maternity, or taking care of a sick family member. If an employee doesn't return to work after being on leave for union duties, they might not be covered by these rules. Sometimes employees continue getting paid during approved leave, like for vacation or sick days, which can make them ineligible for benefits related to work stoppages. If an employer stops paying employees on leave because of a work stoppage, this could be seen as losing their job due to the dispute. In these cases, the rules about work disputes should be followed from the day the payments stop, even if the leave period hasn't ended.

A cause-and-effect relationship between the loss of employment or being unable to resume it, and the stoppage of work, only exists as of the date the employee was to resume employment.  A disentitlement under the labour dispute provisions would apply as of that date.  This would not be the case where the employee had previously been laid off during a period of leave, for a reason unrelated to the dispute.  This approach will be applied equally in the case of leave for illness, injury or quarantine, pregnancy, caring for a newborn or a child placed for the purposes of adoption, or caring for a critically ill child or other family member.\nThere may be other forms of leave such as, leave for union business, from which a claimant fails to return to work once the reason for the leave ends.   These individuals are considered as unable to resume an employment, and therefore, they would be subject to the labour dispute provisions (EI Act 36(1)). A prolonged leave for the purposes of being engaged in other employment could also fall within this category, unless the claimant clearly meets the condition in section 36(1)b) of the act.\nFrequently, a claimant continues to receive payment from their employer, which totally or partially compensates for loss of earnings during a period of approved leave. This is especially true for vacation or sick leave, for which the claimant may receive full pay for some or all of the period of leave. Remuneration may also be in the form of special payments to supplement training allowances received from other sources.\nWhere a stoppage of work is attributable to a labour dispute, an employer may stop paying employees on leave. This break in earnings constitutes a form of loss of employment caused by a stoppage of work attributable to a dispute. In such a case, the labour dispute provisions should be considered from the time the payments stop, even if the original period of leave has not ended.  All facts must be carefully reviewed to determine if a claimant meets the conditions to be exempted from a disentitlement.",0.9924213
529,529,529,"When employees are laid off from their jobs, whether it's regular, seasonal, or casual work, it's common for their employer to call them back to work at some point. Sometimes the date for being called back is pre-determined, while other times it depends on the employer's needs.

When there's a labor dispute causing a work stoppage around the expected date of being called back to work, it needs to be decided if the employees are unable to go back to their old jobs and if they are covered by labor dispute rules. Previously, these cases were considered as loss of employment before a law change addressed them specifically.

Now, it's important to show that if there wasn't a work stoppage, the employees would have been recalled to work. This can be proven by things like getting a notice to come back to work or being scheduled to work on a specific date. If employees miss out on opportunities to go back to work due to a labor dispute, they could be considered unable to resume their previous employment.

This does not apply if employees are called back solely because of the increased need for work during a labor dispute. In that case, they would be entitled to benefits under different rules, not related to labor disputes.",66.2757070707071,10.08787878787879,12.060818386365153,13.77777777777778,11.92299494949495,9.368909090909089,44.44444444444444,4.888888888888889,0.8670020923018456,0.8845991151673454,2.913221802619866,0.4726262440428586,0.4594875046084967,0.04883609585349,4.486363636363636,4.0,2.4148772704642694,24.444444444444443,21.0,8.247708248842503,1.3681818181818182,1.0,0.6914322182229391,220,115,0.5227272727272727,1022,9,8.5.8,Recall to work,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes,"Whether employees are laid off from regular, seasonal or casual employment, it is very common that they may be recalled by their employer. In some cases, the period or date of recall is more or less determined each year, while for others, recall depends on the employer's requirements at a given time.\nIn such circumstances, entitlement to benefits must be carefully considered when, at the pre-set or anticipated recall date, a stoppage of work caused by a labour dispute prevents reinstatement. A determination must be made as to whether these individuals are unable to resume a previous employment and, if so, whether the labour dispute provisions apply to their cases.\nBefore the specific reference to a claimant unable to resume an employment (EI Act 36(1)) was added in the legislation, most of these cases were considered under loss of employment. Prior to this change, cases involving seasonal workers whose jobs end each year at the end of the active season (FCA A-209-89, CUB 16202; FCA A-1036-92, CUB 21236), of casual employees whose patterns of employment may vary greatly, or an unemployed person who  may or may not be recalled, the adjudication of these cases was  much more difficult (FCA A-801-82, CUB 7464; and FCA A-594-91, CUB 19771).\nThe amendments that were made clarified this situation, and now the entitlement to benefits is considered under the provisions of a claimant unable to resume an employment, which more correctly corresponds to the real situation of these claimants.\nIn this context, it is not enough that the worker, unemployed at the time of the stoppage of work, has only an undefined possibility of working during this stoppage; a moral guarantee, or a simple right to recall may be sufficient in some cases, but not in others (FCA A-044-90, CUB 17664). In fact, to be considered as a claimant unable to resume an employment because of a stoppage of work, the evidence must reasonably conclude that the employee would have been recalled and consequently have had employment, had there been no stoppage of work.\nExamples of this include: issuance of a recall notice by the employer or posting of a work schedule requiring the employee's services at a specific date; the fact that the previous termination of employment was only temporary for a pre-set period, and that the employee was to return to work at a specific date (FCA A-209-89, CUB 16202) or, finally, that the scale and regularity of employment reasonably indicate that the claimant would have worked during a stoppage of work (CUB 48815). By not following up on such an offer of or opportunity for employment, the employee is clearly unable to resume a previous employment (FCA A-595-00, CUB 45670A). Such situations require that the labour dispute provisions be applied.\nThe same reasoning applies when a claimant who has been laid off by an employer has reached agreement about reinstatement or an eventual return on a specific date or set period, but could not return on the specified date because of a stoppage of work attributable to a labour dispute (FCA A-595-00, CUB 45670A).\nIn the same way, the seasonal worker should not be considered  unable to resume an employment before it can be reasonably concluded that the employer would have reopened at the beginning of the active season, had there not been a stoppage of work  (FCA A-787-81, CUB 6801 and FCA A-1036-92, CUB 21236).\nThe cause-and-effect relationship between being unable to resume employment and the stoppage of work exists as of the date when the employer would have recalled the employee, had there not been this stoppage, provided the stoppage was continuing at that time. Until this time, there can be no disentitlement pursuant to the labour dispute provisions.\nThe same approach cannot be taken in the specific case of an individual who is recalled to work by an employer simply because the employer requires additional services due to the stoppage of work itself, without which there would have been no recall (Digest 8.5.13).  Although the labour dispute provisions would not apply in this scenario, entitlement to benefits would be considered under other provisions of the act and regulations.",0.9964784

It's important to figure out if a job loss happened because of a work stoppage specifically.

The same principle applies when a claimant is unable to resume a permanent or temporary employment for the same reasons (EI Act 36).\nThe following are not relevant in determining whether loss of employment is attributable to a stoppage of work:\n\nthe fact that the job has just started; is short-term or about to end;\nthat the claimant was hired to replace workers on leave or was discharged on the eve of the stoppage of work;\nthat this employment had been accepted during the off-season of a usual occupation;\nthat the employment was obtained through a union travel card;\nthat the claimant was a regular employee of another firm; or,\nthat the claimant was a student whose job was only to last until the return to school.\n\nSimilarly, whether an employee has already been employed for longer than initially expected is irrelevant if the employment ceases because of a stoppage of work. An employee assigned to a factory where a stoppage of work occurs two days later has still lost employment because of a stoppage of work. The issue is whether the employee was at that job at the time of the stoppage of work, and not how long they were to stay there or whether they should have been elsewhere.\nIt is important to clearly establish the reason for any loss of employment during a stoppage of work, especially in the case of an employee hired on a temporary basis. Even if the loss of employment occurs during a stoppage of work, that may be simply coincidence. Whether or not there was a stoppage of work, this temporary employee would have been laid off for a reason independent of the stoppage of work, for example where a predetermined period of employment has come to an end, in which case the labour dispute provisions are not applicable.

There are also those on an  on call list who have no set schedule or expectation as to when they will  receive their next call in.\nOnce the status of the casual employee is clarified, the impact of a potential labour dispute on the employee can be determined.  The Commission looks for a distinction between two situations: the person who would undoubtedly have worked at some point during the stoppage of work, had there been no stoppage; and the person who had only a vague possibility of being called during that period (Digest 8.5.8).

534,534,534,"An employer might hire new staff even if there is about to be a work stoppage. They might need to replace employees who have left or add more workers to increase production or prepare for a busy period. Sometimes they may recall workers who wouldn't normally be called back to try and reduce the impact of the work stoppage.

If the work stoppage happens, it can affect employees who were hired or called back because of the stoppage, as well as those who were hired for regular business needs. The difference is that the ones called back for the stoppage will follow different work laws. It can be hard to tell the difference between employees hired for which reasons, especially if they were hired shortly before the work stoppage.

Employers might admit hiring someone specifically for an expected work stoppage, while others might say the hiring was permanent. Sometimes, looking at why the employee was let go after work resumed can help clarify this. Over time, it may become clearer whether the employee was hired for regular work or because other workers were not doing their jobs during a dispute.

In most places, hiring replacement workers during a work stoppage is allowed. These workers are linked to the stoppage but are not subject to the same work laws as the regular employees involved in the dispute. Each situation is unique and should be looked at individually.

Just because a strike might happen doesn't mean every new hire is related to it. If someone initially refuses work due to an expected stoppage but later accepts different work and is then affected by the stoppage, they might not be protected by the same work laws.

On the contrary, besides new employees hired to compensate for regular staff turnover, the employer may sometimes increase the work force to increase production, build up inventories, or complete major contracts ahead of schedule. The employer may also attempt to recall some employees who would not have been recalled in other circumstances, in order to mitigate the anticipated or real impact of an eventual stoppage of work.\nIf the stoppage of work does take place, the fact that a claimant has lost an employment or is unable to resume an employment will affect both the employee hired or recalled because of the stoppage of work, and the employee hired or recalled to meet the ongoing needs of the business.

The reason for hiring or recall must be established, to determine if it is a case of a job having been created because of the impending stoppage of work?\nSome employers readily admit that one or more workers were hired or recalled in direct connection with an anticipated stoppage of work. Others may indicate that the employee was hired or recalled permanently. In the latter case, to help clarify the true reason the employer may be asked why the employee was laid off once work resumed following settlement of the dispute.\nThe passage of time may help to show whether the employee was hired or recalled to perform regular work as a replacement for an individual on sick or maternity leave, for example, or whether it was to perform work that regular employees were refusing to do during a period of dispute. The employee may in fact have obtained a job, not lost it, because of an impending stoppage of work.\nIn most provinces, labour legislation does not prohibit strike breakers replacing employees involved in a stoppage of work. The hiring or recall of workers as strike breakers during a stoppage of work is clearly linked to it; the fact that they have lost employment or are unable to resume an employment, whichever is the case, does not render them subject to the labour dispute provisions. Each case must be considered based on its own set of facts.\nEven if it is known to the general public that a strike may take place, this does not necessarily mean that every hiring is linked to this fact. Even if the claimant might initially have shown a valid reason for refusing work offered in such a situation, this does not exclude the application of the labour dispute provisions if the claimant eventually accepts genuine employment not related to an impending stoppage of work, and then subsequently loses or is unable to resume that employment because of this stoppage of work.\nIt must be kept in mind that employment is not considered suitable if it arises as a consequence of a stoppage of work attributable to a labour dispute (EI Act 6(4)(a)); and Digest 9.4.4).",0.99602216

536,536,536,"Workers can participate in a labor dispute in different ways, but what matters most is being directly involved in the dispute itself, not necessarily just joining a work stoppage. This involvement usually happens when the workers are part of the negotiations with their employer, often through a representative. It's important to understand who is actually part of the dispute and who has a direct interest in it to figure out who is participating. Even if someone doesn't agree with what the parties in the dispute are asking for, or with the union representing them, they can still be part of the dispute.

Participation can take various forms like rejecting the employer's offers, getting other union members involved, signing petitions, going to meetings, supporting strikers, voting, slowing down work, resigning conditionally, refusing to work or follow orders, not showing up for work, stopping services, walking out, or joining a picket line.

These ways of participating typically show support for employees who are part of a union and are in a dispute with their employer. These actions usually reflect the behaviors of workers directly involved in the dispute. Sometimes, people who are not part of the dispute might take sides to show support for those who are part of it.

Simply expressing support for those in the dispute doesn't mean someone is actively participating. What matters is looking at the actions of each individual.

But it is  participation in the actual dispute that must be examined, which is not necessarily  the same thing as participation in the stoppage of work (CUB  55320).\nIt is evident that individuals are participating in a dispute when they  are parties to the dispute being negotiated with the employer, usually through  a representative. It is therefore important to distinguish who is a party to  the dispute and who has a direct interest in it, in order to determine those  who are participating in the dispute. The principle does not change, even if a  person disagrees with the demands of the parties involved in the dispute, or  who have a direct interest in it, or disagrees with the demands of the union  which represents them.\nParticipation may take other forms: rejection of the employer's offers,  recruiting union members, signing a petition, attending meetings, passing a  resolution supporting strikers, voting, engaging in a slow-down, submitting a  conditional resignation, refusal to work, to obey orders or to handle  hot materials, failing to report for work, withdrawing services,  walking out or leaving the job, and participating in or honouring a picket  line.\nThese traditional forms of participation are an expression of support  for the demands of employees who are usually unionized and in dispute with their  employer. They generally characterize the actions and attitudes of workers who  are parties to the dispute and have a direct interest in it. It may also be  that, out of solidarity for these workers, other persons take an active  position in respect of the dispute (Digest  8.2.3).\nMere expressions of support for those involved in the labour dispute does  not mean these persons are participating.

Simply not expressing disagreement or distancing oneself from the union's demands can be seen as involvement. Being part of the dispute is enough to be viewed as participating. Disagreement or disapproval with the union does not make a difference unless the entire group collectively disagrees.

The fact that an employee belongs to a union or another association,  does not necessarily mean that the union has the authority to act in the  member's name on all matters. It is the claimant's actions and position in  relation to the dispute that determines their participation in it.\nIt has been held that employees belonging to a union involved in a  dispute are participants if one or more of the following circumstances apply. If they:\n\nfollow the position  established by the union,\nattend a union meeting where a  decision is taken to go on strike or to adopt other pressure tactics,\nfail or refuse to go to work, respect  a picket line, or,\njoin a picket line under  orders from the union.\n\nThere are many examples of support  being given voluntarily by an employee to the union. It does not need to be on  a large scale; the simple fact of not expressing one's disagreement or  dissociating oneself from their union's demands may amount to participation in  the dispute (Digest  8.6.6  and Digest 8.6.7).

Even if it is usually set up when a  strike occurs, a picket line may also appear when the employer has decided to  reduce operations because of a dispute, or to shut down the establishment until  the dispute is resolved. It goes without saying that honouring a picket line is  no longer relevant when there is a total lock-out, because clearly no duties  can be assigned to those who report for work. However, to those who are a party  to the dispute, it demonstrates obvious proof of participation (FCA  A-270-91, CUB  19037)).\nUnionized workers traditionally honour picket lines as a form of trade  union solidarity (CUB  63282 and CUB  48786). Honouring a picket line, whether by solidarity or out of  adherence to union principles, or any refusal to cross a peaceful picket line,  is considered participation. The fact that a clause in the collective agreement  may stipulate that employees who refuse to cross a picket line do not violate  the contract, or that another clause provides that, where a picket line is set  up, the collective agreement is deemed to be terminated, does not change this.\nThus, workers who refuse to cross a picket line and who fail to report  for work are considered to be on the side of the strikers and supporting their  demands (FCA  A-269-91, CUB 19033). It would  be contrary to the purpose of the statute to consider that they are still  entitled to benefits. On the other hand, when workers who are not involved in a  dispute cross the picket line, this does not mean that they are participating  in the dispute by supporting their employer; they are merely honouring the  contract of service with their employer (Digest  8.6.1).\nWhether honouring the picket line stems from personal convictions or from  someone else's advice rather than from union policy, is irrelevant.  Participation depends on whether a picket line was honoured and not whether  there were good reasons for doing so. The issue is whether the refusal or  failure to cross the picket line amounts to a voluntary withdrawal of labour (Digest  8.6.6 and Digest  8.6.7).",0.9991322

However, just because they wouldn't have crossed the picket line doesn't automatically mean they were participating in the dispute. It only applies if an authorized person informed them about being laid off, told not to return to work, or given other similar instructions.

If a group of workers didn't work because the strikers weren't working, they are not considered to be participants in the dispute. But if the employer had work available, it doesn't matter how long the work would last; as long as there is some work, the employees should do it. Any vague statements by the employer should be clarified.

There are times when an employer might stop all operations after being informed by a union about a picket line or lay off workers because they didn't show up for work. In such cases, these employees would be seen as participating in the dispute. If it's unclear who stopped the work, workers should have approached the employer to show they were ready to work.

If some plasterers claimed that there was no work because of a laborers' strike, it wasn't accepted as a valid reason. But if most laborers checked and found no work due to a carpenters' picket line, those who didn't check wouldn't be considered as participating because they already knew there was no work.

This applies  only to the extent that an authorized person notified the employee of the  lay-off, cancellation of the recall to work, or equivalent instructions.\nSimilarly, a group of employees are not considered as participating in a  dispute if there are definite signs that work would not have been available by  reason of the strikers not being at work (CUB 76451 and CUB  56343).

In this case, the  employees would be treated as participants. Should there be doubt as to who  took the initiative of interrupting work, the workers' failure to approach the  employer with a view to informing and assuring the employer of their  willingness to continue their work will work against them.\nAn unsupported contention that work would not have been available for  plasterers because of a labourers' strike was not accepted.

Action by strikers must be examined on a daily basis;  they may be peaceful one day and violent the next.\nHowever, it is not necessary for a worker to attempt to force their way  through the picket line if the circumstances are such that personal injury or  damage to their property can reasonably be expected to result from such an  attempt.\nAmong the many factors to consider are:\n\nwhether the picketers were few  in number;\nwhether any attempt was  actually made to cross the picket line;\nthe sincerity of such efforts  and if they were made by only a few or by a group of workers;\nwhether non-strikers  outnumbered strikers;\nwhether the two groups  belonged to affiliated unions;\nwhether an effort was or  should have been made to obtain the picketers' consent;\nwhether the non-striker had no  alternative but to fail to report for work;\nwhether it was practical to  seek police protection; or,\nwhether the strikers were  violent or made threats (Digest  8.6.8).\n\nIn all cases, a worker must prove by sufficient credible evidence that they  considered a legitimate fear of violence and that this very fear was the reason  for their failure to cross the picket line. If the fear is legitimate, undue  weight should not be given to the fact that a worker did not seek police  protection, since protection cannot easily be afforded 24 hours a day.",0.99543506
543,543,543,"Fear varies from person to person and is based on how someone sees what is happening around them along with other factors. Let's take the example of someone who needs to cross a picket line. They might be afraid because they think they could be hurt by the people on strike or face revenge later on.

There isn't a specific rule to decide if this fear is justified. Fear alone isn't enough. It's only considered justified when there is real proof showing that violence could happen. Guessing or just thinking something might happen isn't good enough. If there is no past violence and no clear sign that the strikers will turn violent, then the fear isn't seen as reasonable. But if there were strong hints or threats of violence, then the fear would be seen as justified.

For example, if there are threats of violence, a big difference in numbers between workers on strike and those not on strike, or if they are from rival groups, then the fear of violence might be understandable. Past violence somewhere else or a long time ago isn't enough to make fear reasonable by itself.

Fear of harm to oneself, family, or property can also make the fear of violence real. This doesn't include being treated badly or called names. Just being in a place where violence could happen isn't proof enough.

If a worker doesn't cross a picket line out of fear, they have to prove that their fear is real to be seen as not quitting voluntarily. Just saying they're scared isn't ok, they have to show that what they fear is likely to happen. 

It's important to look at both sides of the situation and see if danger is real. Picketers need to be watched to see if they are being hostile to those who want to go to work. Situations can change day by day, and violence is more likely when the dispute is long, illegal, or if the employer brings in others to work. Some trades and unions are known to use intimidation tactics regularly.

Looking at news and police reports can help understand what's happening. If the police report says nothing happened, it doesn't mean nothing bad occurred since not all incidents get reported.

Lastly, not every worker needs to feel this fear, but those who do must be able to show why they didn't want to cross the picket line.",80.61859490986214,6.443149522799576,9.54385415503706,9.959703075291625,7.80497030752916,7.909560975609754,33.923647932131495,2.869565217391304,0.8195711943236265,0.8178216048649379,2.603114802266026,0.6358446683146979,0.4423214936138542,0.0594657814505062,4.314634146341463,4.0,2.184430603446365,17.82608695652174,18.0,7.190889005407518,1.278048780487805,1.0,0.6213722795680428,410,194,0.473170731707317,1852,23,8.6.8,Legitimate fear of violence,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes,"Fear is quite clearly a state of mind, something that differs greatly from  one person to another. It is one's appreciation of events, combined with several  other factors. An individual, confronted with the obligation to cross a picket  line, may fear immediate acts of violence or subsequent reprisals by those  involved in the dispute.\nThere is no benchmark or absolute rule for determining whether an  individual is justified in fearing violence. Fear alone, in this context, is  not the determining factor; it becomes legitimate only when it is based on  concrete elements and on facts which show that such constraints exist.  Unsupported assumptions or mere possibilities are not enough. Where no violence  has occurred and where nothing suggests that strikers are determined to resort  to force or violence, fear is regarded as being unjustified. But fear is  legitimate where any attempt to cross a picket line would very likely have led  to acts of violence or reprisals (CUB  63282 and CUB  48786).\nIndications that may support a legitimate fear of immediate violence  are, of course, serious threats of violence. An imbalance in numbers between  non-strikers and strikers, the fact that they belong to rival unions, or a show  of force may also be indicative of potential violence. Violence that occurred  elsewhere or several years earlier does not alone make fear legitimate.\nFear of reprisals against one's person, family or property may also  amount to a legitimate fear of violence. Reprisals here refer to those of a  physically violent nature and do not include moral harassment such as being  treated with contempt and called a scab. The fact that the place of employment  may lend itself to reprisals is not enough.\nThe only possible way a worker may show that their refusal or failure to  cross a picket line does not amount to a voluntary withdrawal of labour is by  demonstrating that their fears are legitimate (FCA  A-373-82, CUB 7065 and FCA  A-269-91, CUB 19033). Unsupported  declarations of fear on behalf of an individual group of organized workers for  the purpose of obtaining benefits must be carefully scrutinized. In principle,  individuals can only testify as to their own fears. Those who speak on behalf  of others should be asked to indicate their sources.\nA study of the facts is essential to review both sides of the dispute  and determine if the threat of violence is legitimate. The situation may also  change from day to day. The behaviour of picketers must be examined to see  whether there are signs of hostility toward those who wish to report for work,  and to what extent this animosity takes the form of threats, aggressiveness and  violence. Violence is more likely to be present when the dispute is prolonged or  illegal, following the suspension of union leaders, or if union recognition is  at issue. The same is true when the employer resorts to strike breakers. Some  trades and union locals may be known for their regular use of intimidation  tactics.\nNews releases and newspaper articles may be useful in researching and  evaluating the facts surrounding strikers' behaviour (Digest  8.1.10). A police report indicating that no troubles were reported is not  necessarily conclusive because even unreported violence or threats must be  taken into account.\nLastly it is not necessary that all members of the same grade or class  feel this legitimate fear of violence. However, it must be felt and shown by  the workers themselves that this fear is the reason they did not attempt to  cross the picket line.",0.9746402
544,544,544,"The ways in which a person can participate in a work stoppage can vary, and they don't have to be involved for the entire duration. For instance, if a worker who is not part of the disagreement and doesn't have a direct stake in it decides to support the strikers by joining a picket line for a brief time or even just one day a week, they are still considered part of the labor dispute. This person is seen as participating as long as they support the workers on strike.

If an individual continues to participate, they won't meet the conditions that would exempt them from penalties. However, if they stop participating but meet other exempting conditions, they will not face penalties. The involvement of coworkers in the same position as the individual does not matter.

546,546,546,"Historically, the term ""financing a dispute"" meant providing money to help employees who were involved in a labor disagreement that caused them to lose their jobs. Anyone who gave money to support these employees, whether they did it willingly or not, was seen as financing the dispute as per the labor laws. However, a recent decision by the Supreme Court made a stricter interpretation of what it means to finance a dispute. This decision aligns better with the overall goal of the law and prevents innocent people from being punished because of a labor dispute. The Court emphasized that financing a dispute involves actively giving money to the workers involved in the disagreement, and it must be a voluntary contribution. The Court also clarified that if money supporting the workers comes from a fund set up by an international union where members are required to pay dues, those members are not considered to be financing the dispute. In Canada today, unions do not act as representatives for employees, so paying union dues does not necessarily mean someone is funding a strike. To put it simply, financing a dispute requires a direct and voluntary connection between the financial support given and the labor disagreement. These two aspects are very important.",55.75726741095164,11.251355661881975,12.838901577100671,14.264965443912812,13.663503455608712,12.24095693779904,53.36576289207868,7.0,0.8587137013673782,0.8511138558387756,2.9826372719093026,0.7868459007435759,0.4146912828905165,0.0295907596523221,4.985645933014354,4.0,2.881185410115,23.22222222222222,24.0,7.5832824581118015,1.507177033492823,1.0,0.8364862555598163,209,124,0.5933014354066986,1062,9,8.7.1,What does financing a dispute mean,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes,"Historically, this expression signified the general fact of providing  financial assistance to one of the parties to the dispute, namely the  employees, in order to help them set up and maintain a stoppage of work  attributable to a labour dispute, resulting in the loss of their employment. This  meant that anyone who provided a monetary contribution to this financial  support, whether voluntarily or not, directly or indirectly, was considered to  be a person who was financing a dispute, pursuant to the labour  dispute provisions of the act. \nSince then, a Supreme Court's majority judgment has resulted in a more  restrictive interpretation of the word finance. This judgment  better reflects the purpose of the act  as a whole, and prevents innocent victims of the dispute from having their  benefits denied. It was argued that the act  should be interpreted in a way that would be compatible with the values in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms concerning the right of freedom of association (FCA  A-021-77, CUB 4454 and S.C.C  19094, FCA  A-175-84, CUB  8764).  The judgment  maintained the concept that the word financing used in the labour  dispute provisions implied an active connection between the payment and the  dispute, and a direct action on the part of the claimant to provide financial  support to the workers involved in the dispute. Furthermore, according to the  Court, the word financing requires active participation by the  claimant, a free and voluntary contribution to this same cause. \nThe Court found that these elements were not present where the financial  support provided to the workers in the dispute is issued from a fund  established and administered by the international union; in that case, the  person had no choice but to pay union dues, a portion of which was diverted to  that fund, and had no voice in the decision of the international union to  finance the dispute.\nThe Court emphasized some important principles regarding the  union-employee relationship that exists nowadays in Canada. The point was  stressed that, today, unions are neither agent nor mandatory for the employee;  upon this construction, a claimant who pays mandatory union dues could not be  held to finance a strike through such dues.\nTo sum up, the word financing implies a meaningful  connection: a direct action between the contribution and the labour dispute and  requires a free and voluntary participation by the claimant to provide  financial support to the dispute. These two characteristics are essential.",0.9940665

Now, it's not just about giving money to employees in a dispute to be considered as financing that dispute. Even though giving money is important, just giving money doesn't automatically mean someone is funding the dispute.

The actual name for the money being given doesn't matter much, whether it's called strike pay, picket pay, lock-out pay, relief money, or a loan. What's crucial is that this help actually reaches the workers who are part of the dispute.

It's tricky to figure out who contributed and how if we don't track the money back to where it came from.

548,548,548,"The money that a union uses for its activities comes from union dues that are taken from the pay of workers who are part of the group that the union represents in negotiations. These dues can be saved in a general fund for different purposes, or in a specific fund to help members financially during conflicts. Sometimes these funds are managed by the local union, but more often they are managed by a larger union that represents common interests on a bigger scale.

Local unions are connected to the larger central union and send a portion of their members' dues to ensure services like legal defense and financial support during disputes are provided. These funds are important to achieve union goals and are looked after by demanding measures like mandatory dues.

Employees usually have to pay dues to the union and might have to become a member. However, they could have an option not to become a member right away or at all. The Supreme Court decided that in a situation where employees are required to pay dues without having a say in how they are used, the employees are not considered to be funding a dispute based on specific court points.

This commonly happens with strike funds that are made up of dues that must be paid. In these cases, it is not hard for individuals to prove they are not financing a dispute. This applies no matter the union's level or how the fund is managed to assist employees during disputes. Even if employees are part of the group involved in the dispute, they are not considered to be funding it.

If employees willingly donate or have a say in funds used to aid workers in disputes, then they are considered to be financing the dispute. However, if a union decides to provide financial support without employees being able to influence the decision, then employees are not viewed as funding the dispute.

These may be used to set up a general fund for various uses,  or to set up a specific fund designed to provide financial support to its  members, for example, in case of labour disputes. Such funds may be established  and managed strictly by the local union or, as is more frequently the case, by  a central union of provincial, national or international scope which represents  their common interests. The local unions are affiliated with the central union  and remit a percentage of the union dues deducted from their own members in  order to guarantee various services, such as professional defense and a  relative protection of their income in case of disputes.\nIt would not be possible to pursue union objectives without these  incoming funds and without insuring its continuance through union security by  demanding certain measures such as mandatory payment of union dues, among  others. An employee is generally required to pay dues to the accredited union, obliged  to become a member of the union, may be free to not become a member, or there  may be a certain delay before an employee becomes a member.\nWhat this means is that a specific situation where the employees are  obliged to pay union dues into a fund over which they have no voice or control,  is in line with the Supreme Court's conclusion. It was decided that the two  essential elements that characterize who is financing a dispute  were not present in such a situation (Digest  8.7.1 and Digest  8.7.2).\nThis is not an exceptional situation since most strike funds are comprised  of mandatory union dues. Consequently, in most cases, these individuals will  have no difficulty proving that they are not financing a dispute within the  meaning of the exempting clause.\nThis applies regardless of the level of the union's constitution and  administration of a fund that will ultimately support the employees in the  dispute. It is independent of the fact that the contributing employees are  members of the negotiation unit that is a party to the dispute, or that they  are receiving strike indemnity from this fund.\nA situation may be different from the one studied by the Court, either  because the employees contributed voluntarily to the fund, or had a voice in  the decision to use this fund to support the workers involved in the dispute.  This would be the case when an employee voluntarily contributes, whether  through regular dues or by a special fund-raising campaign, to a fund  constituted and administered at some union level, and having a specific  objective to help the workers involved in a dispute.\nA second situation of this kind may be where the decision to provide  financial support to these workers is made at a general or special meeting of  union members of the negotiation unit to which an employee belongs. The decision  of the majority of the members to provide such a support will bind this  employee, whether or not they agree with this decision, and even when there is  no other choice than to contribute to the fund that is used for financing. It  can be said generally that a person should accept not only the advantages, but  also any disadvantages that may result from their association with others.\nIn both of these situations there is an active and direct connection  between the payment and the dispute, and a free and voluntary participation  from the employee. These are the two essential characteristics of who is  financing a dispute.\nA decision by a union executive, to unilaterally provide financial  support to the workers involved in a dispute from a fund made up of mandatory  dues, does not bind the individual employees. This is true, even if  theoretically they have a right to question this decision or can present a  motion of disapproval. It cannot be said that this decision of the union  executive means that the individual employee, who was obliged to contribute to  the fund used for financing and did not have a significant right to decide in  favour or against this support, is financing a dispute.\nWhile the majority of the members may vote in favour of financial  support to the workers involved in a dispute, some may officially declare  themselves to be against this position, or as non-unionized or probationary  employees, did not have the democratic right to take a position on the  question. Such arguments could lead to the conclusion that these persons are  not financing a dispute.",0.9827062
549,549,549,"Union dues paid to a shared strike fund are the main way unions support their members during strikes. These funds might not always be enough, especially if the strike lasts a long time. In such cases, unions might seek help from other unions or groups at the same workplace to provide additional financial support. 

For example, another union or local group at the workplace not in the dispute can offer money to support the workers on strike. The Supreme Court has specified two important conditions for this support. One is that the majority of the local union members must agree to provide this financial aid.

Sometimes a local union might use its own money to help during a strike, such as by covering costs like renting space for strikers or printing signs. These expenses, which are approved by the union leaders, should not be considered as being paid for by each union member.

In situations where essential services need to continue during a strike, some workers might choose to donate part of their pay to support the striking workers. This is a direct and voluntary way for them to contribute to the strike.

Individual members of a union might also choose to donate money to help during a strike. When members give money freely to support the workers on strike, they are considered to be helping finance the strike.",71.30133226037198,8.137864806866954,9.2995712137729,10.170100143061518,10.190951359084409,10.031416309012876,41.30507868383405,4.25,0.8531539656899192,0.8487057209014892,2.668373085966499,0.4762609039449286,0.4456741119425276,0.063738449146543,4.652360515021459,4.0,2.277753205248614,19.416666666666668,19.0,4.590902840279774,1.3690987124463518,1.0,0.6223915895037766,233,121,0.51931330472103,1104,12,8.7.4,Other forms of financing,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes,"Union dues remitted to a consolidated strike fund established  specifically for the defense of its members undoubtedly constitute the main  source of financing for the payment of strike indemnities. Rarely, however, are  such funds so large as to meet all needs, particularly if the strike is prolonged.  Some unions will resort to other means, call upon other resources or invoke  union solidarity to obtain financial support for the workers involved in the  dispute.\nAnother union organization or local working at the same place of  employment but not involved in the dispute may show their solidarity to the  workers involved in the dispute and provide financial support either in a lump  sum or continuous manner. It will then be necessary to determine whether the  two characteristics judged essential by the Supreme Court are present in this  situation (S.C.C  19094, FCA  A-175-84, CUB  8764; Digest  8.7.1 and Digest  8.7.2). Such would be the case when it is specifically following the  decision of the majority of the local union members, that this financing  support be provided (Digest  8.7.3). \nIt may be that a local union will use its own funds to support a  dispute, by financing certain activities or operations for the benefit of the  strikers, for example by renting premises for their use, printing picket signs,  or even advertising in the media. Such expenditures that do not go specifically  to the workers involved in the dispute and that are usually authorized by the  union executive should not be considered as being financed by each of the  members.\nIn the case of essential services, some employees who are required to  continue to work despite the dispute will agree to remit part of their wages as  a contribution to the cause of the strikers. By such a direct and voluntary  contribution, these employees are without a doubt financing a dispute.\nCertain members of a local union may also be financing a dispute  on their own.

550,550,550,"Union rules often state that there is a waiting period at the beginning of a strike before any financial help is given to workers. This waiting period ensures that the strike is ongoing. The amount of financial help provided to strikers depends on factors like if they are married and how involved they are in strike activities like picketing. 

The funding for the strike doesn't start when the first payment is made, but rather from when the strike benefits become available. This funding continues as long as the workers are being helped during the strike. Just because the strike benefits are being paid out, it doesn't necessarily mean that someone is providing the funding for the dispute.

In some situations, if the local union gives the workers loans during a strike, the funding period starts from the first loan given and ends with the last loan given.

If the strike is funded through one lump sum payment instead of weekly payments, the funding begins on the day the lump sum is given and continues until the strike ends.",68.42200621546964,9.336512430939226,9.827888789773866,11.480939226519338,11.7410635359116,10.180110497237568,44.17196132596685,4.875,0.8596043160983494,0.8763594528039297,2.737567726391256,0.4329322380849751,0.467072070086776,0.0703565819536034,4.640883977900552,4.0,2.135800416115256,22.625,23.5,7.261843774138907,1.3646408839779005,1.0,0.6126371834532205,181,94,0.5193370165745856,859,8,8.7.5,Period of financing,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes,"Union constitutions usually provide for a waiting period at the  beginning of a stoppage of work before benefits may be paid to strikers.

552,552,552,"This text is about how people are involved in labor disputes. It explains that sometimes it's clear if someone is directly involved in a dispute, like if the issue affects their own job. But it can be tricky when the issue doesn't directly relate to the worker's pay or conditions. 

If workers who are not part of the dispute are still affected by the outcome, they are considered directly involved. On the other hand, if a person might benefit indirectly from the resolution, they are not directly involved. 

The text also talks about how the end result of a dispute shouldn't determine if someone was directly involved. It mentions that even if a person benefits from the solution to a dispute they were not part of, it doesn't change things. Direct interest is determined by how closely someone's job is tied to the issues being negotiated. 

It also explains that just because one union in an industry negotiates a good deal, it doesn't mean another union in the same industry is directly involved. Being a union member representing workers in negotiations does show direct interest, especially if the worker's job terms are part of the discussion.

Lastly, it touches on how if a person's relationship with their employer ends completely, their direct interest in a dispute may end as well, especially for temporary employees.",64.09155502392346,9.469074960127596,10.63711953065702,11.624242424242423,10.996267942583737,10.315087719298248,47.04306220095694,5.454545454545454,0.874075424671173,0.8594950172636244,3.206256132667616,0.7105558207787831,0.4248060250931063,0.0686177584974898,4.684210526315789,4.0,2.5915374745495114,20.727272727272727,20.0,4.59428318854301,1.4385964912280702,1.0,0.7198329206641629,228,115,0.5043859649122807,1111,11,8.8.1,Definition of the expression directly interested,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes,"The act does not define  what is meant by this expression. There is no clear dividing line between what  is direct and what is indirect, and it is not always easy to distinguish  between the two.\nGenerally an individual is directly interested when the issues in  dispute relate directly to their own job. However, this does not mean there is  no direct interest in a dispute in some situations where the issues under  dispute are not related to the worker's own pay or conditions of work. This situation  may occur during a labour dispute where the employer opposes one of the trade  unions that represent some of the workers on a particular contentious issue.  Workers who are not part of this unit, have nothing to do with and are not part  of the dispute, are nevertheless directly interested if the outcome will  automatically be applied to them, either as part of a collective agreement, or  an established industrial custom or practice. The fact that the employer may  have no obligation to follow this practice does not matter, unless it is known  that the employer will not follow it (Supreme  Court decision 28876; FCA  A-552-00, CUB  48786 and CUB  48815). It is a pure question of facts based on the particular situation of  the case under study to determine if the industrial custom or the relevant  practice is well enough established (FCA  A-741-87, CUB  14021).\nIf an individual is not part of the union and is not involved in the labour  dispute activities, but may indirectly benefit from the final resolution, they  are not considered directly involved.  There  is no direct interest if the only issue is the possibility of revising pay  scales or working conditions once the dispute involving other workers has been  settled, or if an individual would have benefited from a new collective  agreement, had they been a member of the union. The same applies if a worker takes  advantage of a dispute in order to support their own wage demands. Even if the  facts show that a worker did benefit from the solution to the dispute involving  another group of employees, it does not change this line of reasoning. When  employees who are not involved in the dispute seek an end to the strike so that  they may be reinstated, they have only an indirect interest (CUB  15967, CUB  14236).\nThe end results of a dispute should not be the determining factor as to whether  a person was directly interested in a dispute. It is possible that an  individual may be directly interested in the dispute, whether, in the end, the  negotiations, result in an advantage, or if nothing was gained from it. When it  has been determined that the worker has a direct interest, the value of the  benefits at issue is not relevant (CUB  48786 and CUB  48815).\nThe question is not whether a person wins or loses, but if the interest  in the dispute is direct. The possibility of gain clearly strengthens the likelihood  of direct interest in a given case. Direct interest should also be considered  where the claimant shows solidarity with other workers involved in the dispute,  or if the claimant objects to the hiring, continued employment, or dismissal of  other workers.\nIt is quite common for a union to succeed in negotiating an agreement,  including rather sizeable salary increases for a particular industry. The sole  possibility that another union in the same industry demands the same increases  when negotiating its own agreement later on, is not sufficient grounds to  conclude that the second union had a direct interest in the negotiations  undertaken by the first union. The fact that a collective agreement negotiated  with an employer is used as a model for other collective agreements negotiated  elsewhere in the same field of activities, does not mean there is a direct  interest from workers who are not directly governed by this model agreement.\nIt may be difficult for a person to rebut direct interest while being a  member of the union that is negotiating a new collective agreement, and  belonging to one of the group of workers represented by this union. Direct  interest is present when the terms and conditions of the claimant's employment  are included in the negotiations.\nOnce the interest is only incidental to the dispute, it can only be  indirect. Serious consideration must be given to the facts and circumstances,  taking into account the nature of the dispute.\nFinally, a complete and final severance of the employer-employee  relationship may demonstrate that some workers, namely term employees, are no  longer directly interested in the dispute (FCA  A-594-91, CUB 19771; Digest  8.13.1 and Digest  8.13.2). It should be clearly established that such a severance is  permanent by nature, as opposed to a temporary lay-off (FCA  A-1198-82, CUB 7454). For  example, these employees have no recall rights or promise of a pattern of  employment that guarantees they will be rehired once the dispute is settled.",0.9813479
553,553,553,"When a union and an employer are in a dispute, it usually involves deciding on a collective agreement. If a person is directly affected by the agreement in question, it means that their job conditions could be directly impacted by the outcome of the dispute. This includes things like wages, working hours, overtime pay, and benefits.

Even if only some of a person's job conditions are covered by the agreement, they still have a direct interest in the dispute. It doesn't matter if the individual supports or opposes the proposals being made.

Sometimes, workers whose job conditions are not part of the agreement being disputed can still be directly affected. But if an employer permanently closes a workplace during a dispute, employees from that location may lose their chance to return to work there unless they have seniority rights and can be reassigned to another location.",59.04662162162164,10.275984555984556,12.031772070788634,13.051737451737452,12.023117760617758,11.365675675675677,52.22393822393822,6.571428571428571,0.8363142311573029,0.8545652508735657,2.804195668215632,0.6066213722614147,0.4633381364551963,0.0686710249732134,4.858108108108108,4.0,2.6661292296874355,21.142857142857142,18.0,7.6798171746946355,1.4932432432432432,1.0,0.711836429943626,148,90,0.6081081081081081,739,7,8.8.2,Ratification of collective agreement,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes,"More often than not, a dispute between a union and the employer relates  to the ratification of a collective agreement. To decide whether a person has  direct interest, the question to consider is whether that person's employment  will be governed by the agreement in dispute.\nIf it is, the direct interest is obvious. The person's own working  conditions are under negotiation and may be directly changed by the outcome of  the dispute. This is the case when the dispute deals with such matters as  wages, a retroactive increase, hours of work, overtime, job classification,  vacation, seniority, job security, grievance procedure, travel allowances,  union security, elimination of positions, fringe benefits or the duration of  the collective agreement (FCA  A-1198-82, CUB 7454). \nA dispute over whether a person's job should be included in the  collective agreement gives that person a direct interest. It is not relevant whether  an individual supports or opposes the proposals that have been made, or whether  the worker is on leave at the time of the dispute. \nA direct interest exists even when only some of the claimant's working  conditions are governed by the collective agreement. Similarly, to be directly  interested, it is not necessary that the person be concerned with the central  issues of the dispute. The issues applicable to the claimant may be of  secondary importance or may have even been settled. It is sufficient that any  working condition related to the employee's own employment be covered under the  collective agreement in dispute.\nIt may happen, in certain exceptional situations, that the workers whose  working conditions are not governed by the collective agreement in dispute are  nevertheless directly interested (Digest  8.8.1). In one case, a claimant whose job was covered by the  collective agreement even though he was a co-owner of the business was held not  to be directly interested, given that he acted more as an employer.\nWhen the wages of an employee are partially based on the rate paid to  other employees whose collective agreement is in dispute, the interest is  indirect. The same is true when the employer has no obligation to maintain  relative equality between the employment conditions of workers covered by the  collective agreement and those who are not; however, it may happen, in certain  exceptional situations, that these groups of workers could both be directly  interested  (Digest  8.8.1).\nA collective agreement is not strictly limited to a single place of  employment. It is possible that employees at different places of employment  working for the same employer are subject to the terms and conditions of a  single collective agreement. This may lead to a single dispute involving  employees at these various places of employment. In such circumstances, an  employer may decide to permanently stop all operations at one of these  premises. This is normally enough to deny those workers at the closed premises,  any possibility of returning to work there, and they consequently have no  further interest in the dispute (Digest  8.11.4). The same conclusion cannot be reached when the workers retain  their seniority rights and could therefore be recalled at other premises  involved in the dispute, and which will undoubtedly reopen once the dispute is settled.",0.9988815

Thus, depending on whether the percentage of the normal weekly earnings  is small or large, the days of disentitlement in a week will vary from zero to  five.\nThe objective here is to disentitle a claimant, or in other words reduce  the weekly benefits, only to the same extent as the part-time employment that has  been lost or cannot be resumed due to the stoppage of work. This introduces the  notion of equity that had not been part of the prior provisions (Digest  8.9.0).\nThe percentage of part time earnings in comparison to normal earnings  represents what was intended to be measured.  That is, the relative importance of the part-time employment that a claimant  has lost or is unable to resume due to a labour dispute, to the employment(s)  used to establish the weekly rate of benefit (Digest  8.9.3 and Digest  8.9.4). Once the percentage of the part-time earnings to the full-time  earnings is known, the table in EI  Regulation 52(2) is used to determine the number of days of disentitlement in  a week.\nThe disentitlement must be for a precise number of days in a week, and continues  for each week for as long as the disentitlement applies (is not ended or  suspended) (Digest  8.1.7 and Digest  8.1.9); the days where the disentitlement may apply are not  predetermined and may not be the same from week to week. \nThe fact that the start or end of a period of disentitlement occurs in  the middle of a week does not change anything in respect of the number of days  of disentitlement that will apply in a week of unemployment. What must be  ensured is that the number of days of disentitlement applied to either the  first or the last week of the stoppage of work, does not exceed the number of  days that are affected by the stoppage of work. If, for example, the prescribed  disentitlement is to be for three days a week and the end of the period of  disentitlement occurs on a Monday; the disentitlement would only apply for one day  in that week.\nFinally, because the claimant's weekly insurable earnings in the calculation  period could change from one benefit period to the next, the calculation of the  number of days of disentitlement in a week could equally change from one  benefit period to the next. Thus, even where the same part-time employment and  the same stoppage of work straddles two benefit periods, the exact number of  days of disentitlement in a week for this claimant may be different from one  benefit period to the next.",0.9280799
566,566,566,"The rules are about how to figure out how much money someone makes in a week from a part-time job they lost because of a work problem. To do this, we need to know if the person had a set schedule for their part-time job. 

We usually check their work records to see how often they worked. If we can't find that information, we ask the person or even contact their boss. Then we look at different scenarios, like if they worked regularly every two weeks. If they did, we can calculate how much they made each week.

If the person's work schedule was irregular, we look at their pay for the 20 weeks before they lost their job to find an average weekly amount. This helps us understand what they would have earned each week if they kept working.

We also consider different cases, like if the person's hours changed right before they lost their job. In that situation, we calculate their average based on their previous work hours instead of the new ones.

If someone can't go back to their old job after the work issue is resolved, we estimate their future earnings based on how they used to work. But if we think they would have worked differently in the future, we figure out their new average pay based on those expected changes.",81.09701149425288,6.750862068965521,9.725611199111238,10.491954022988509,8.051149425287356,7.405517241379307,33.55747126436782,2.75,0.8536095781759783,0.8587376475334167,2.7408457762517866,0.3135407180467177,0.4026562826914489,0.0536843637800712,4.206896551724138,4.0,2.027896997058225,19.33333333333333,18.0,5.572751165766829,1.2543103448275863,1.0,0.6017062293550804,232,116,0.5,1009,12,8.9.3,Average weekly earnings from part-time employment,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes,"The regulations introduce the concept of average weekly earnings from a  part-time employment that the claimant has lost or is unable to resume because  of a stoppage of work due to a labour dispute.\nAt the outset it must be shown that at the moment the part-time  employment was lost or could not be resumed, the claimant had worked or would  have worked in this employment according to a definite pattern. In this context  it is logical that the determination of the average weekly earnings from the part-time  employment would be determined based on this pattern of employment.\nIn most cases the information on the record of employment (ROE) will be  sufficient to determine the pattern of employment. Where the information is not  available, the information could be obtained from the claimant. The employer must  be contacted when the information obtained is insufficient, not credible or contradicts  information contained on the ROE.\nNumerous scenarios may exist in the establishment of the claimant's  pattern of employment at the moment when they lost part-time employment. The  first scenario could be the regularity of the pattern of the part-time  employment. For example, the claimant who works one day every two weeks and  earns $180 would have average weekly earnings of $90 in this case.\nIn another case it could be an irregular pattern of part-time employment,  such as the claimant who works on an on-call basis with varying earnings and at  irregular intervals. In this case the approach taken should be reasonable and take  into consideration the realities of this part-time employment. In this sense a  window of twenty consecutive weeks preceding the moment when the claimant lost  the part-time employment constitutes a sufficiently long period to reflect the  recent reality of this part-time employment and permit a satisfactory  determination of the average weekly earnings.\nThe actual earnings from the part-time employment during the 20-week window  will be divided by the number of weeks worked during that period, to determine the  average weekly earnings from the part-time employment. The actual earnings in a  given week could be minimal or nil, if the claimant had not worked. It could also  surpass the maximum insurable earnings, if they had worked full-time.\nIf the irregular pattern of part-time employment started in a week  within the preceding twenty weeks, then the calculation will only go back to that  week and consequently will cover a period of less than twenty weeks. Thus, for  example, within a window of twenty consecutive weeks, it is only at the tenth  week that the claimant's employment, which was on a regular part-time or a  full-time basis, becomes irregular part-time employment. For the purposes of  the calculation, only the weeks from where the employment became irregular  part-time, would be considered; that is, from the tenth week.\nThe fact that the pattern of employment had only recently become  part-time when the claimant lost that employment will not change this approach.  It is the pattern that the claimant would have normally continued to work, had  it not been for the stoppage of work. It is from this pattern of employment,  regular or irregular, that the average weekly earnings will be determined, even  when that pattern of work just recently started.\nThis will not be the case however when the recent pattern of employment  would only have been for a short period, or was directly related to the anticipated  stoppage of work. For example, a claimant whose regular pattern of employment  of two days a week for $150 was increased to four days a week because of the  looming stoppage of work. In that case we would determine the average weekly  earnings based on the pattern of employment which previously existed, without  taking into consideration the most recent pattern. This would result  in average weekly earnings of $150.\nThe approaches developed to this point would equally apply to claimants  who are unable to resume a previous employment. The pattern of work in the  future, had there not been a stoppage of work, would in most cases be the same  as the past employment held with this same employer. In this case, average  weekly earnings will be determined on the basis of the past pattern of  part-time employment, whether it was regular or irregular.\nHowever, if indications are that in the absence of the stoppage of work,  the pattern of employment going forward would have been different than the past  pattern of part-time employment the average weekly earnings will be calculated based  on what the claimant's future pattern of part-time employment would have been,  had it not been for the stoppage of work.",0.9593142

It's important to understand why someone is asking for benefits during disqualification due to a labor disagreement. Disqualification suspension isn't an option if the reason doesn't match the ones mentioned. 

First, it needs to be confirmed if the person is eligible for benefits despite the work stoppage. They need to meet conditions like having enough work hours and providing necessary documents. For instance, someone with fewer than 600 work hours can't get certain benefits like maternity or parental benefits. The same goes for someone who already got the maximum sickness benefits and then asks for more during the work stoppage. 

If someone can get benefits from the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan during the work stoppage, they won't be able to prove they qualify for EI maternity or parental benefits. 

A person may have multiple reasons during a benefit period that could allow the disqualification to be suspended, like receiving sickness benefits and then maternity benefits.

Suspension of the disentitlement is not considered if the reason is not one of those mentioned above.\nThe first step is to determine whether the claimant is otherwise entitled to benefits for the reasons stated, despite the work stoppage. The claimant must first meet the qualifying conditions for the type of benefits being requested, such as having accumulated the required number of hours of insurable employment, and having any documents to support their declarations for the period during which benefits are requested. A minor attached claimant (has less than 600 hours in their qualifying period), for example, cannot receive maternity (EI Act 22(1)), parental (EI Act 23(1)), compassionate care (EI Act 23.1(1)) or family caregiver (child and adult) benefits (EI Act 23.2(1) and EI Act 23.3(1)).

As a general rule, this person cannot prove that they are otherwise entitled to EI maternity or parental benefits (EI Regulation 76.09).\nA claimant may provide several reasons during the benefit period, that would allow for the suspension of the disentitlement. For example, sickness benefits followed by maternity benefits followed by parental benefits. Each of these types of benefits must be examined separately with respect to their own conditions of entitlement.\nThe fact that a person would otherwise be entitled to benefits for the reasons mentioned does not guarantee that the disentitlement will be suspended. A supplementary condition provided in the legislative text must also be met, and is dealt with in the following heading.",0.94850504
570,570,570,"A person cannot delay a disqualification period just because they could have received different benefits during that time. According to a specific law, the person also needs to meet an additional requirement.

To fulfill this requirement, the person has to show that they planned to be away from work for the specific reason they are asking for benefits, and that they started making plans for this absence.

This extra requirement only matters if there was a time when the person could have received benefits. It basically means that if someone was expecting to be away from work for a specific reason and had started making plans before they actually stopped working, they can receive benefits related to that reason. This prevents people from trying to get benefits by avoiding disqualification while they are not working.

To meet this requirement, the person has two things to prove. They need to show that they expected to be away from work for one of the reasons mentioned, and that they had started planning for this absence before stopping work. It's not necessary to know the exact length of time they would be absent before they stopped working. If the absence was for a different reason or if they didn't make clear plans beforehand, they won't meet this requirement.

Just saying that they started planning is not enough. The person needs to back up their statement with documents or any other evidence. For example, they could show that they informed their employer beforehand of the expected absence, or had asked for permission at that time. But even these actions may not be enough to meet all the requirements.

In most cases, the last thing a person does before taking time off work is to make arrangements with their employer. However, they also need to provide other proof to the officials about the plans they made before stopping work. It's not necessary that all the plans were finalized before stopping work. Also, it's possible to start making plans without informing the employer.

This prevents access to benefits by those who may attempt to avoid disentitlement, during the course of the stoppage of work.\nIt is necessary to determine at what precise moment the stoppage of work occurred in order to accurately determine if the absence was anticipated and if arrangements for that absence had begun before the stoppage of work. This will be more complicated if at the claimant's place of employment there were several stoppages of work due to the same labour dispute and they were of varying duration. In this case it will be considered to be the stoppage of work which is tied to the disentitlement that the claimant is requesting be suspended.\nThis supplementary condition imposes two separate obligations on the claimant. Not only must there be proof that the absence from employment, for one of the reasons mentioned in the legislation, was anticipated, but also that arrangements for this absence had begun before the stoppage of work occurred. It is not necessary that the exact period of absence had been fixed or known before the start of the stoppage of work. An anticipated absence for reasons other than those mentioned, or which was not accompanied by concrete arrangements to this effect, will not fulfill this condition. The same is true when the arrangements were not in relation to the anticipated absence or only started during the course of the stoppage of work.\nA statement from the claimant that arrangements were started is not sufficient to avoid a disentitlement. The claimant must substantiate the statements with documents, certificates and/or any other supporting information. For example, the claimant may show that they advised the employer before the stoppage of work, of the anticipated absence, or had at that time requested authorization for the absence. Such arrangements by themselves may not demonstrate that the claimant fulfills the supplementary condition on all points.\nIn fact, for the person who anticipates an absence from employment, these arrangements with the employer are, more often than not, the last thing the person does. Other arrangements, depending on the reasons for the absence from work, must be made and it is these arrangements that the claimant must furnish to the Commission as proof that they began before the stoppage of work. There is no requirement that the arrangements be finalized before the stoppage of work. It must also be realized that a person may have begun making arrangements without saying a word to the employer. The fact that a claimant has absented themselves from employment with or without the employer's authorization, or even, that the arrangements were made without the knowledge of the employer, does not change the fact that arrangements had begun.\nIt rests with the Commission to determine what constitutes acceptable proof that the claimant fulfills the supplementary condition",0.95115393
571,571,571,"The person applying for benefits needs to provide more than just a simple statement. They must show that they knew they would be away from work and had started planning for it before they stopped working. It's important for the person to give all the necessary information, explanations, and sometimes documents to prove that they met this condition.

If someone is pregnant, they can show proof by declaring their pregnancy and when they expect to give birth when they apply for benefits. This proves that they were pregnant before they stopped working.

For those taking care of a newborn, they can provide proof by getting confirmation from their employer that they had arranged to take time off before they stopped working. They can also show through their work history that they had planned to take time off to care for a newborn in the past. A statement can also work if it shows that plans were made before they stopped working to care for a newborn.

A statement from a doctor can show that it was known before they stopped working that they would need to be away from work to care for a newborn's health.

If someone needs to take time off for compassionate care, they must provide a medical certificate showing that a family member is very sick with a high risk of dying within 26 weeks and needs help. Proof can also be confirmation from the employer that plans for the absence had started before they stopped working.

People asking for family caregiver benefits need a medical professional to sign a certificate showing that a family member is very sick or hurt and needs care from a family member. The certificate must say how long the family member will need care.

For illnesses, injuries, or being quarantined, they need to provide a medical certificate showing that the absence was planned before they stopped working. This is only for situations where they knew they would be away for treatment, surgery, or detox and had started planning before they stopped working.

If someone is attending a course or work activity, they just need to prove that they were referred to it and had started planning to participate before they stopped working.

A person could also demonstrate by their work history that the absence was anticipated and planned in order to take care of a newborn child, if this had been the case for an earlier birth. Moreover, a statement can also be accepted if it demonstrates that arrangements were in place before the stoppage of work, for a claimant to take a leave for a certain period of time, to care for the newborn child.\nA statement from a medical practitioner could also establish that it was known, before the start of the stoppage of work, that a newborn child's state of health would eventually require one of the parents to be absent from work.\nIn the case of compassionate care leave, the claimant will be required to submit a medical certificate for compassionate care benefits attesting that a family member has a serious medical condition with a significant risk of death within 26 weeks and requires the care or support of one or more family members. Acceptable proof may be confirmation from the employer that the arrangements for the absence from work had begun before the stoppage of work.\nClaimants requesting family caregiver benefits are required to submit a medical certificate signed by a medical professional. An attestation by the medical professional is required, indicating that the family member is critically ill or injured and requires the care or support of a family member.  The medical must also indicate the period during which the family member  is expected to require care or support.\nWith respect to illness, injury or quarantine, the claimant will be required to submit a medical certificate attesting that the absence was anticipated before the start of the stoppage of work and that some arrangements in that respect had begun before the stoppage of work. This refers strictly to an illness or injury for which an absence had been anticipated, be it for treatment, surgery or a stay in a detoxification centre, and in respect of which arrangements had begun before the start of the stoppage of work.\nWhat is not included in this category is an illness or injury that was diagnosed before the stoppage of work, but before the start of the stoppage of work, it had not been anticipated that there would eventually be an absence from work. The same would apply in the case of an illness or injury which occurred before the start of the stoppage of work, but the claimant had not made any arrangements to be absent from employment until after the start of the stoppage.\nIt would however, be acceptable where the illness is related to a chronic or degenerative condition that results in episodic absences from employment, whose existence was known before the start of the stoppage of work.\nFor those attending a course or employment activity, it need only be confirmed by the designating authority that there was in fact a referral made to attend a course or employment activity, and that arrangements for participation had begun before the stoppage of work.\nFinally, a vague possibility of an absence, without further specifics is not sufficient to arrive at the conclusion that the absence was anticipated. It is necessary that the elements of anticipation, planning and organization exist before the start of the stoppage of work in order for an absence to be considered as anticipated before the stoppage. The situation here is one where the claimant had begun making arrangements before the start of stoppage of work and the absence from employment had been one of the anticipated outcomes.",0.986007
572,572,572,"The suspension of a penalty allows a person to receive benefits they qualify for, even if there is a labor dispute happening. Participating, financing, or being directly interested in the dispute won't matter as long as the necessary requirements are met.

Suspending the penalty won't stop the dispute or the work stoppage. The dispute could still be resolved, or the person might no longer be affected by the penalty based on certain conditions. When the penalty can be lifted, the suspension doesn't matter.

The fact that there was participation, financing or direct interest will not have any bearing during the period where the claimant fulfills the legislative requirements relating to the suspension of the disentitlement (EI Act 36(3); Digest 8.10.1 and Digest 8.10.2).\nThe disentitlement will be suspended for as long as the conditions are met. Once the claimant is no longer otherwise entitled to another type of benefits during the benefit period, the disentitlement due to the labour dispute will automatically be re-imposed. Furthermore, as long as the legislative requirements are met, it is possible that there could be more than one period where the disentitlement is suspended during the course of the same labour dispute or benefit period.\nThe fact that a labour dispute disentitlement has been suspended will not prevent the labour dispute and the stoppage of work to follow their course, that a resolution between the two parties could occur, or even that the claimant, at a certain time, could meet the conditions of non-application (EI Act 36(4) and Digest 8.1.4).

573,573,573,"The end of a work stoppage is not a random event but something that is decided together to bring the work stoppage to an end. When a work stoppage ends, certain conditions must be met. According to EI Regulation 53(1), a work stoppage at a place like a factory ends when at least 85% of the normal workforce returns to work, and when production levels reach at least 85% of normal as well.

For a work stoppage to be considered over, both the workforce and production activities must be at least at 85% of normal. If one reaches 85% but the other does not, the work stoppage is not considered over. The quality and quantity of production activities must also be at least at 85%.

Ending a work stoppage is one of the things needed to completely resolve a disagreement between workers and employers. Just because a work stoppage ends doesn't mean the disagreement is completely settled, and vice versa. It's not common for both to happen at the exact same time.

If a dispute affects multiple locations, the end of the work stoppage must be determined separately for each location. It could end on different dates for each site based on their specific circumstances. Calculating the 85% minimum for workforce and production activities can be tricky, as determining what is considered ""normal"" is not always clear.",68.94083333333334,8.405000000000001,11.20814326018867,11.84057971014493,9.75789855072464,9.626956521739132,43.94927536231884,4.75,0.8081515864892439,0.8008943140506745,2.7058800806272427,0.3888197168653853,0.4384773554046,0.0509406499530499,4.586956521739131,4.0,2.7786146607423365,19.166666666666668,17.5,7.243771270700244,1.4,1.0,0.7077213895435063,230,104,0.4521739130434782,1089,12,8.11.0,Termination of the stoppage of work,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes,"The termination of a stoppage of work is not an isolated event which suddenly occurs by chance. Rather, this event is collectively resolved and brings the stoppage of work to an end (Digest 8.4.0 to 8.4.3).\nThere are regulations in place prescribing the circumstances that must exist in order for the  stoppage of work to be considered ended. EI Regulation 53(1) states:\n\u2026 a stoppage of work at a factory, workshop or other premises is terminated when\n\nthe work-force at the factory, workshop or other premises attains at least 85 per cent of its normal level; and\nthe level of activity in respect of the production of goods or services at the factory, workshop or other premises attains at least 85 per cent of its normal level.\n\nThe termination of the stoppage of work has occurred when two indicators have been met; that is, the number of the work force, and the activities related to the production of goods and services have returned to 85% of normal levels.\nThis 85% minimum is a rigid benchmark between the continuation of the stoppage of work and the end of the stoppage, which occurs when this minimum is attained. The 85% minimum must be obtained in both indicators. Without it, it cannot be concluded that the stoppage of work has terminated. For example, if the work force equals or surpasses the normal level by 85%, but not the activities related to the production of goods and services, the stoppage of work has not ended (Digest 8.4.2). Regarding the production of goods and services, a minimum of 85% must be met in both quantity and quality.\nThe determination that the stoppage of work has ended is one of the two factors that permits the termination of the disentitlement (EI Act 36(1)). The question is whether the stoppage of work has come to an end with regard to the business as a whole, or, if the labour dispute was more limited in its impact, with regard simply to those operations or group of workers affected by the dispute (Digest 8.4.1).\nTermination of the stoppage of work does not necessarily mean that the dispute has come to an end.  Just like the fact that the dispute may be settled does not mean the stoppage of work is immediately terminated. It would be quite unusual for these two events to occur at the same time (Digest 8.11.2).\nAlthough a sole dispute could stop activities at several places of employment, the determination of when the stoppage of work terminates must be considered separately for each of these locations. The termination of the stoppage of work could therefore occur at different dates because of the actual situation existing at each of these places.\nFinally, it must be remembered that the 85% minimum must be calculated on the basis of what constitutes the normal level of the work force and the activities related to the production of goods and services. In many cases it is not easy to determine the normal level which corresponds to each of these indicators.",0.99615943
574,574,574,"The rule says that work stoppage ends when at least 85% of the usual level of employees and activities related to making goods and services are back to normal. This normal level is what things would have been like if the work hadn't stopped. Normally, the number of workers and activity levels from before the stoppage give a good idea of what's normal. Overtime work levels can also count as normal. But, it's not normal if the staffing and activity levels were only reached because of special or temporary actions taken by the employer during the labor dispute. The real normal level is calculated after excluding these special actions. 

The normal level changes over time and can vary based on different worker numbers and activity levels. Any usual variations in production throughout the year should also be considered. Contracts the business would have usually gotten if work hadn't stopped and there was no dispute matter too. 

The previous situation before the work stoppage could be due to factors connected to the dispute or possible stoppage of work. If changes in staffing or activity levels before the work stoppage, whether up or down, are due to reasons not linked to the dispute, then this is considered normal. These reasons might be the economy, competition from others, or regular seasonal breaks.

If changes in staffing or activity levels are because of the dispute or possible work stoppage, they don't count when deciding the normal level. The normal level should be what would typically happen if these factors weren't there.

Sometimes things might change during a work stoppage or when work resumes, and this could affect what's considered normal.

Generally, the number of employees and the level of activities that existed before the stoppage of work is a good indicator of what the normal situation would have been. The level of production that had been attained due to overtime operations could also qualify as being normal. The normal situation is not, however, when the work force and the level of activities were attained because of exceptional or temporary measures taken by the employer, to lessen the effects of the labour dispute situation. The normal situation would be determined after discounting these measures (Digest 8.11.6).\nThe normal situation evolves from one moment to another and could result from the differing number of employees and level of activities during this time. It is necessary to consider fluctuations in production, if these normally occur during the course of the year. Contracts that the business would have normally obtained or achieved, if not for the stoppage of work and the dispute, are also factors to consider.\nThe situation as it existed before the stoppage of work could also be attributed to factors related to the labour dispute, and the potential stoppage of work. The situation would be considered normal if changes to the work force or the level of activities prior to the stoppage of work, whether reduced or increased, can be explained by factors not relevant to the dispute.  These factors could include the economic climate, competition reduced or increased by competitors, or, active or seasonal shutdowns.\nHowever, when factors are related to the dispute and potential stoppage of work and are causing a reduction or increase in the work force or level of activities, it is not considered when determining the normal situation. The normal situation would correspond to one that would normally have existed in the absence of these factors.\nSometimes circumstances could occur during the course of the stoppage of work, or at the resumption of activities, and have a bearing on the normal situation (Digest 8.11.2 to 8.11.5).

575,575,575,"In most cases, when a dispute at work is settled, it doesn't necessarily mean that everyone can go back to work right away. Usually, the process of getting back to work is gradual and depends on agreements between the workers and the company. Often, only a small group of workers needed for specific tasks will be called back first.

The settlement of the dispute doesn't automatically end the situation for everyone involved. What really matters is when people can start working again. Getting back to work might take time even after the dispute is resolved, especially if there are other issues causing delays.

Sometimes, even after a dispute is over, there might be other reasons causing work to stop. In these cases, it needs to be figured out if the stoppage is still because of the original dispute or something new.

After a dispute is resolved, it can still be challenging for work to return to normal, like getting new orders or customers back. If the stoppage is due to damages from the dispute or the workplace being shut down, it's considered part of the dispute. If the delays are because the employer is making changes like staff restructuring or renovations, then it's not seen as part of the dispute.

There are rules that determine when the stoppage of work officially ends, especially in some specific situations.",71.93261363636367,8.00840909090909,9.516144504307135,10.297402597402598,10.113831168831169,10.025974025974026,45.6569264069264,5.083333333333333,0.8847974755547263,0.8818536996841431,2.7213620906384066,0.4582553170169102,0.4817308487483925,0.0757059196123168,4.653679653679654,4.0,2.49006195466516,19.25,21.0,4.437059837324712,1.3636363636363635,1.0,0.642824346533225,231,120,0.5194805194805194,1110,12,8.11.2,Settlement of dispute resumption of activities,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes,"There is no absolute rule that says the settlement of the dispute is conditional on the resumption of activities. The parties could agree to resume activities even if there is no immediate apparent solution to the dispute or they could be prevented from resuming activities where no settlement has been reached. This does not mean that the number of employees at work and the activities related to the production of goods and services will instantly attain the levels equivalent to the normal situation (Digest 8.11.1).\nIn the vast majority of cases, the resumption of work is a gradual process, governed by a back-to-work agreement and the business' requirements. It is quite likely that only those workers who are needed to perform the preliminary tasks in preparation for the resumption of normal business activities, will initially be recalled, for example, to start up the machinery or repair equipment. This situation may also apply to a small group of employees who may be recalled one or more weeks before the majority of the workers affected by the labour dispute. Whatever the case may be, this does not by itself result in the termination of the disentitlement for those recalled, unless, when resuming employment, the claimant effectively holds the same job that was held before the stoppage of work occurred (Digest 8.12.0).\nThe settlement of the dispute has little bearing on the disentitlement. It is the termination of the stoppage of work which is the deciding factor and which permits the termination of the disentitlement (EI Regulation 53; FCA A-1063-87; CUB 69099C). The question is not whether the claimant is still involved in the dispute, but whether the claimant continues to be involved in a stoppage of work attributable to that dispute.\nEven when a labour dispute has been settled, it likely leaves an impact which continues to affect the normal course of the activities of a business for some time. This may be the case, regardless of the impact of other factors unrelated to the dispute, which can also delay the resumption of activities. The causal relationship between the dispute that has been settled, and the stoppage of work that continues, should not be based merely on speculation. The period of time between the settlement of the dispute and the termination of the stoppage of work must be a natural consequence of the dispute. If it is not, facts must be obtained before concluding that there is a causal relationship between the past dispute and the continuing stoppage of work.\nIt may also happen, once the dispute is settled, that another unrelated cause arises and becomes solely responsible for prolonging the duration of the stoppage of work. It then becomes necessary to determine the point at which the stoppage ceases to be directly attributable to the dispute and when another stage begins; that is, due to another cause.\nObviously, in this context, it is in the interest of claimants and unions to minimize the impact of the conflict in explaining the delay in resuming the course of normal activities, or to introduce other causes that are minimally or entirely unrelated to the dispute (Digest 8.4.3). Regardless of this, each of the parties must be given the opportunity to state their case and be assessed fairly and objectively, in order to determine whether the resumption was delayed or prevented in some way, as a result of the dispute.\nOnce the dispute is settled, it is often difficult, depending on the sector involved, to resume normal activities as if nothing had happened, to secure new orders, or to recover lost clients. Such considerations may be sufficient to show relative continuity in the relationship between the dispute and the stoppage of work.\nThe continuing stoppage is obviously due to the dispute if it results from damages caused by the dispute or closure of the premises, unless the employer does not take immediate steps to put the machinery in working order. A delay due to the employer's intentions to restructure the staff or to proceed with renovations, is not attributable to the dispute.\nOther circumstances could also prevent the attainment of the 85% minimum. A regulatory provision specifies at what time the stoppage of work terminates in those circumstances (EI Regulation 53(2); and Digest 8.11.3).",0.99201024
576,576,576,"When a business has a labor dispute and work stops, many things can affect the business once the dispute is resolved. Some effects are directly related to the dispute and work stoppage, while others are unrelated and can impact the workforce and business activities. These effects can be small or big, short-term or long-term, and may last even after the dispute is settled. Regardless, they do not change the link between the initial work stoppage and the dispute.

In some cases, specific circumstances affect whether the work stoppage ends. For example, if an event causes a business to operate at least 85% below normal workforce or activity levels, the work stoppage might end. This could be due to a business closing, restructuring, natural disaster, or changes in the economy or technology. These circumstances alter the normal business operations and are considered in determining when the work stoppage finishes.

These circumstances don't have to greatly impact the business to be considered. Even a small 10% reduction in workforce or activities could be enough to meet the 85% threshold. It's also important to note that any temporary measures taken by the employer to counter the effects of the work stoppage should not be counted when calculating the level of workforce or activity.",66.11854290569245,8.870169923534409,10.63711953065702,11.33322005097706,11.561151231945622,11.721308411214952,50.29566694987256,6.0,0.8150739073753357,0.8258464535077413,3.0343341192935536,0.7920785174661568,0.4442451243137743,0.0620607061664133,4.939252336448599,4.0,2.7156609498002955,19.454545454545453,18.0,5.80538365130531,1.4299065420560748,1.0,0.7052824652233982,214,113,0.5280373831775701,1089,11,8.11.3,Circumstances preventing attainment of 85%,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes,"A business where a stoppage of work due to a labour dispute occurred may be impacted by many circumstances when the dispute is resolved. For the most part, these circumstances are related to the dispute and the stoppage of work. Other circumstances, specific to the business or a sector of the economy, that are unrelated to the dispute and the stoppage of work, could also occur, which would have an impact on the work force and business activities.\nThe effects of these circumstances on the number of workers and the level of activities could be minimal or significant, temporary or long term, and in the latter case, may be felt beyond the settlement of the dispute and the subsequent resumption of activities (Digest 8.11.2).\nWhatever the situation, generally, the fact that these circumstances occur during the course of a stoppage of work and impact the normal situation of a business, does not change the relationship between the cause and effect linking the initial stoppage of work to the dispute (FCA A-181-83, CUB 7842; and FCA A-270-91, CUB 19037).\nAmong these circumstances there are some which will always be considered in light of the regulation dealing with when the stoppage of work terminates. Here is an extract of EI Regulation 53(2):\r\n Where, in respect of a stoppage of work, an occurrence prevents the attainment of at least 85 per cent of the normal level of the work-force or activity in respect of the production of goods or services at a factory, workshop or other premises, the stoppage of work terminates:\n\nif the occurrence is a discontinuance of business, a permanent restructuring of activity or an act of God, when the level of the work-force or of the activity attains at least 85 per cent of that normal level, with the normal level adjusted by taking that occurrence into account; and\nif the occurrence is a change in economic or market conditions or in technology, when \r\n \nthere is a resumption of activity at the factory, workshop or other premises, and\nthe level of the work-force and of the activity attains at least 85 percent of that normal level as adjusted by taking that occurrence into account.\n\n\n\nThese prescribed circumstances share the common fact that they happen during the course of the labour dispute and they prevent the attainment of a minimum of 85% of the normal level. Moreover, it must be noted that these circumstances modify, at least for an indefinite period, the normal situation of the business or the specific operation of the business affected by the stoppage of work. It is logical, therefore, to adjust what would constitute the normal situation for the two indicators. It is then against the adjusted level that a determination would be made as to whether the 85% minimum has been attained.\nThese circumstances do not have to have a great impact on the two indicators. It is sufficient that they prevent the attainment of 85%. For example, it is relevant if a circumstance results in reducing the work force or activities by 10%, which could be just the amount that is needed to attain a minimum of 85% of the normal level.\nFinally it is important to keep in mind that any exceptional or temporary measures taken by the employer for the purpose of offsetting the effects of the stoppage of work must not be taken into consideration (EI Regulation 53(2); and Digest 8.11.6).",0.99522394
577,577,577,"When work stops for a long time, the employer might make important decisions for the business, like declaring bankruptcy or selling it. Natural disasters like fires or floods can also severely impact a business that is already facing a work stoppage. 

There are rules about how to deal with situations like shutting down the business permanently, restructuring it, or when a natural disaster affects most of the usual work activities. These rules only apply if a certain percentage of normal work activities are affected. The impact on these activities must be concrete and long-lasting, not just guesses or plans to start negotiations. 

To understand if a business is really ending or if negotiations with workers are just a tactic, actions like stopping dialogue, moving operations, or closing down need to be considered. Sending notices to workers about potential job loss, paying off remaining benefits, or selling parts of the business don't necessarily mean the business is closing for good.  

Restructuring activities temporarily to keep essential services running during a dispute is different from permanently changing how work is done. The changes should be significant and lasting, not just temporary fixes or small adjustments in roles. 

Changes in the economy, market, or technology can lead to permanent restructuring of work activities, but there needs to be some level of work resuming to consider this. 

In summary, if certain conditions prevent at least 85% of normal work activities from happening, a new calculation will be done to see if enough workers are back and working to reach that 85% level, after adjusting for the impact of the new conditions.",53.040149850149874,12.026819846819848,13.88584557914918,15.641558441558445,14.753376623376624,12.687326007326009,56.32001332001332,7.818181818181818,0.9093853950500488,0.9025126894315084,2.912811246744665,0.461460778532253,0.4729933511597048,0.0463575435080815,5.047619047619048,4.0,2.868536500913504,24.818181818181817,22.0,7.952337355865104,1.52014652014652,1.0,0.8257291020428057,273,150,0.5494505494505495,1411,11,8.11.4,Discontinuance of business permanent restructuring act of God,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes,"A stoppage of work which has dragged on, may, in many cases, be the trigger which causes the employer to take or forestall certain decisions in respect of the future of the business, or an activity which was particularly impacted by the stoppage. Whatever the motives, an employer could, during the stoppage of work, declare bankruptcy, proceed to sell the business, transfer the activities elsewhere, or restructure.\nAs well, a business is not sheltered from an act of God such as fire, an explosion, or a natural catastrophe like an earthquake, mud slide, tornado or flood, which may irreparably affect what would have been the normal situation, had there not been a stoppage of work.\nThe regulations provide for a particular treatment in the case of a discontinuance of business, permanent restructuring, or an act of God where such circumstances prevent the attainment of 85% of the normal activities for the two indicators (EI Regulation 53(2)). These circumstances will not be considered if they don't affect these two indicators, or they only affect activities not implicated in the stoppage of work. Except when it concerns the discontinuance of business, it is at the time activities resume that these circumstances could apply.  It is important that these circumstances become concrete and, in the long term, permanently modify the normal situation (Digest 8.11.1) of the business or activity impacted by the stoppage of work. They must not simply be projections or probabilities, or form part of a statement of intentions or strategies used to force negotiations.\nIt is important to analyze the pertinent facts beyond the mere intentions, statements or any action on the employer's part (CUB 46110, CUB 24335, FCA A-38-96, CUB 31276). For example, the negotiations should be examined as to whether they have broken off, whether there is no further dialogue, operations have been transferred, assets liquidated, notice of closure sent to the Department of Labour, payment of amounts due on final closure, etc. Such actions may be an indication as to whether the action is intended merely to intimidate or counter an uncompromising union.\nIt may happen that workers receive a letter informing them that their employment will end at such a date, if they do not return to work (FCA A-814-91; CUB 20138), or that the business will close if the offer is rejected. Such notices do not necessarily signify that the employer has closed the business, even when accumulated leave credits or reimbursements of pension contributions have been paid. It may be a tactic to incite the workers to return to work.\nThe sale or cessation of parts of the business will not necessarily put an end to the dispute or to the stoppage of work (CUB 21211). The dispute and stoppage could continue, even if there is a new buyer. Generally, the new buyer must recognize the present union, and respect the agreements and contracts previously signed. Selling all or part of the business may, however, lead to a permanent restructuring of activities.\nAn employer could proceed with a temporary restructuring of activities in order to maintain essential services, until a solution is found to the dispute. This is not what permanent restructuring means. Such exceptional or temporary measures must not be included in the consideration of adjusting what would constitute a normal situation (Digest 8.11.6). Neither could they be used in the calculation of the 85% minimum (EI Regulation 53(3)).\nIt must be a true and long-term restructuring of the group of workers or of the activities affected by the stoppage of work (FCA A-38-96, CUB 31276) and not just a shift of roles or a minor change in duties. Nor does this apply to the regular restructuring between the active season and the off-season (Digest 8.11.5).\nIn order to consider the effects of a permanent restructuring of activities which could arise because of changes in the economic conditions or market, or result from technological change, at least some level of resumption of activities would be necessary (EI Regulation 53(2)).\nIn conclusion, when a prescribed circumstance prevents the attainment of a minimum of 85% of the normal situation, a new calculation will be made. The intent is to see whether the number of employees at work, and the production activities, attain at least 85%, having adjusted the normal situation as a result of these new circumstances. In other words, the decline in the number of employees and in the activities that are attributable to these circumstances would be subtracted from the normal situation.",0.9849101
578,578,578,"When work stops because of certain issues like technology changes or economic conditions, it might be hard to reach at least 85% of the normal level of work and production. In that case, a new calculation is needed to see if the 85% minimum is met, considering these changes. This calculation is important because it decides when work can start again. 

These changes, like new technology or economic conditions, can affect not just one business, but a whole group of businesses or even the entire economy. They can happen during cycles of progress, trade, growth, or recession and can change how businesses usually operate for a while or even permanently. 

Once work resumes, we need to see if these changes prevent reaching at least 85% of the normal level for each aspect of work. 

If a business is usually slow during a certain season because of economic reasons, that's not considered a change from normal. This is because regular slow seasons already consider the economy's impact. So, if a labor dispute is solved during the slow season, work levels won't change. 

Changes in technology or the economy that lead to a permanent change in a business's activities only matter once work resumes. These changes can greatly impact when work can start again. 

For example, if after work resumes, technology or economic changes lead to a 10% reduction in workforce and production, making it impossible to meet the 85% minimum of workers and units produced, calculations need to be adjusted based on the new number of employees and units after the changes.",64.43282581453636,9.779060150375944,11.855464076750408,13.07719298245614,11.87532581453634,10.606766917293232,48.85839598997494,5.916666666666667,0.8403464718298479,0.8351147055625916,2.910239264109204,0.6005882236088942,0.457211834891745,0.0699450490016206,4.7180451127819545,4.0,2.561905264530873,22.166666666666668,21.0,9.956851354162565,1.4172932330827068,1.0,0.7168237457251342,266,122,0.4586466165413533,1298,12,8.11.5,Changes due to technology economic or market conditions,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes,"When there is a resumption of activities and there are changes due to technology or in economic or market conditions, these may prevent the attainment of a minimum of 85% of the normal level in the two indicators previously mentioned (EI Regulation 53(2)(b)) and Digest 8.11.3). In this case a new calculation is provided to determine whether the minimum of 85% is attained, but this time, taking into account these changes on the normal level. This element is critical as it determines when the stoppage of work terminates (Digest 8.11.1).\nIn many cases, these technological or economical changes are not solely occurring at the business where the stoppage of work occurred, however they nonetheless have a bearing on determining the situation that would have been normal. Most of the time, the impact is on a sector of activities which the business is part of, or even on the whole economy, for example, computerization, automation, free trade, quota reduction, high interest rates, dollar exchange, or a decline in market demand for products or services, etc.\nThese changes may occur in a cycle of transformation, technological progress, rationalization of activities, international trade, economic growth or recession, or market evolution. They will have a bearing on the activities of a whole group of businesses and transform these businesses from their normal situation for an undetermined period, if not forever.\nIt is only when activities impacted by the stoppage resume, that we must determine whether these changes prevent the attainment of a minimum of 85% of the normal level for each indicator (EI Regulation 53(2)(b)(i)).\nWhere the regular off-season in the sector of activities of which the business is a part, originates from the conditions of the economy or market, this does not properly lead to a finding of a change from the normal situation. These are annually recurring conditions and the levels reflect the normal situation which, at that time, has already taken into account the conditions of the economy or market tied to the off-season. Therefore there will not be any adjustment to the levels if the parties come to an agreement about the labour dispute, during the off-season (Digest 8.11.8).\nChanges due to technology or in the conditions of the economy or market that result in a permanent restructuring of the activities of a business are not relevant unless there has been some resumption of activities (EI Regulation 53(2)(a)) and Digest 8.11.4). At that point, these circumstances could have a significant bearing on the termination of the stoppage of work.\nSupposing that at the resumption of activities, the changes in technology or in the conditions of the economy or market lead to a reduction of 10% of the work force and the business' activities, to the point where the 85% minimum of the 100 employees normally at work and the 1000 units normally produced each day, cannot be attained. The regulatory text (EI Regulation 53(2)) provides that the minimum of 85% which determines the termination of the stoppage of work must be recalculated but this time, on the basis of 90 employees and 900 units of production, which constitute the normal level, adjusted because of the changes at the business.",0.9928042
579,579,579,"The text explains that during a labor dispute at a company, the usual way things operate at the business is considered normal. However, if the employer takes temporary or unusual steps to keep the business running, it doesn't mean that work stoppage hasn't happened. If the employer uses temporary measures to continue work, even successfully, there is still a work stoppage. This can disrupt the normal flow of work and affect other areas of the business. 

It's important to know which measures the employer takes will be permanent, if the striking employees will return to work, and if they actually do return. Factors like how many workers are on strike, how many replacement workers are used, and whether these replacements are temporary or not, all play a role in determining if there is a work stoppage. 

If the employer uses special measures to keep the business going during a strike, these measures are not considered when calculating certain benefits for employees. If a strike only involves a small number of workers and the employer's measures prevent work stoppage, it may not be considered a true work stoppage. 

In some cases, after a strike, the employer might use temporary measures to make up for the lost time. These measures are not factored into certain benefit calculations according to regulations.",58.8433190045249,10.542122171945705,12.68835289967788,13.90787330316742,12.488009049773758,11.409230769230764,51.96425339366516,6.6,0.8580536577436659,0.8679317459464073,3.0433228209698795,0.8161674546629408,0.43280280177339,0.0603885785612287,4.855203619909502,4.0,2.639215669034875,22.1,22.0,6.236184731067546,1.484162895927602,1.0,0.7586442126176275,221,113,0.5113122171945701,1107,10,8.11.6,Exceptional or temporary measures,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes,"As we have seen, what constitutes the normal situation of a business corresponds to the levels of the work force and activities which would normally have existed, had it not been for the dispute and the stoppage of work (Digest 8.11.1). These levels have nothing to do with what would have been obtained because of exceptional or temporary measures taken by the employer to increase activities. For example, the employer may increase the capacity of production or the quantity of stored products, or, delay certain contracts, in anticipation of the stoppage of work, or to lessen its effects.\nAn employer may, for a temporary period, give priority to certain tasks and in doing so, drop others that are less useful, or use other employees, even strikebreakers, to maintain essential services.\nThe fact that the employer has taken steps to maintain the firm's production, or that of a more limited group of workers, at a normal level, does not necessarily mean there has been no stoppage of work. As a general rule, there is a stoppage of work when an employer maintains operations with the help of exceptional or temporary measures, no matter how successful these measures may be (FCA A-340-79, CUB 5266B, FCA A-143-80, CUB 5869 and FCA A-556-91, CUB 19727). \nOftentimes, such measures have a detrimental impact on the work, which must be performed elsewhere, and thus disrupts the operations of the firm as a whole. Temporarily abandoning office and maintenance work for strictly production work constitutes a stoppage of work in sectors other than production (CUB 21211); whatever the level of production, there is a stoppage of work if the interruption of operations in other sectors is relatively significant.\nIt is important to know which of the measures used by the employer will become permanent, whether strikers will return to work once the dispute is settled, and whether they have actually returned to work.\nIn order to determine the permanent or temporary nature of the measures taken by the employer, consideration must be given to:\n\nthe volume of operations affected\nthe number of employees on strike,\nthe number and type of replacement workers, and whether the replacement workers are permanent or temporary (Digest 8.11.7),\nthe hours worked are normal, or the operations are performed at the expense of other operations, such as maintenance or repairs,\nthe importance of the neglected operations, and \nwhether the link between employer and employees is permanently broken (Digest 8.13.0).\n\nTo authorize payment of EI benefits to strikers simply because the employer has managed to restart and maintain operations through exceptional measures would be to violate the very purpose of the legislative provisions dealing with labour disputes, and create a major source of inequity.\nThis is particularly true when the dispute affects only a small number of workers, and where the employer's measures succeed in preventing the stoppage of work. It is hard to claim that a stoppage of work has taken place when a strike by some employees has no significant impact on ongoing operations.\nThe employer could also take exceptional and temporary measures at the resumption of activities in order to compensate for the effect of the stoppage of work. These measures are not to be taken into account when calculating the 85% minimum (EI Regulation 53(3)) and Digest 8.11.3 to 8.11.5).",0.89468104

Even if work resumes normally with regular methods, it doesn't mean that the situation can't change from temporary to permanent over time. 
When a work stoppage ends, it doesn't always mean that the original employees will return to work. The employer might have hired new workers to continue operations. This decision can be seen as a strategy to weaken the striking employees and try to find a solution to the dispute. 
Sometimes, in highly debated disagreements, extreme actions are taken. For example, the employer might fire the striking employees for good and hire new workers, considering them as full-time employees. These actions are usually part of a larger tactic to pressure the employees and try to solve the disagreement.

The issue then becomes focused on the permanent or provisional nature of the action taken by the employer.\nRadical positions are taken from time to time, particularly in highly contested disputes. For example, an employer may permanently dismiss the striking employees and hire replacement workers, describing them as permanent employees. Such action should normally be viewed in the context of an overall reactive strategy to wear down, discredit and intimidate, in order to force a favourable solution to the dispute, and to remove radical elements.

581,581,581,"This is about when a whole group of workers in a company or field lose their jobs because of a break in work during a slow period, like in winter for boat transportation or in agriculture. The slow period happens every year and can last for months.

When workers lose their jobs because of a labor dispute before the slow period starts, they might not get benefits during the slow time. This is important, especially when the slow period is long. It used to be thought that workers could get benefits once the labor dispute ended, but now the rules are clearer, and benefits may not start until the slow period is over.

If there's a clear break in the worker's job with the company or if certain conditions are met, the rules might change. For example, teachers might not get benefits during breaks between school terms unless they are no longer employed or involved in a labor dispute.

It is often expected to last a fairly long period, a season if not more. It will recur year after year, at a relatively fixed period of time, which for all practical purposes excludes any shutdown that would be only occasional or of a short duration.\nThe question here is whether all workers who lost their employment due to a work stoppage attributable to a labour dispute, before the beginning of the off-season, will remain disentitled to benefits for the duration of the off-season. This is particularly important when the off-season lasts from three to six months (depending on the type of business and activities).\nAt one time it was held that the disentitlement could be terminated as of the date the claimant could prove that, in the absence of the labour dispute, the claimant would not have been able to work, which is the case in a seasonal shutdown.  This line of thinking appears contrary to the text of the legislation, which limits the termination of the disentitlement to one of only two circumstances (EI Act 36(1)(a) and (b)). It is not possible to interpret any of these two paragraphs as signifying that the disentitlement ends when the labour dispute ceases to be the real cause of the unemployment (FCA A-181-83, CUB 7842).\nThe final resolution rests on the reasons for the claimant's loss of employment at the time they became unemployed, more so than reasons that arise during the work stoppage, regardless of whether it is a seasonal shutdown, or a vacation period during Christmas or during the summer (FCA A-559-89, CUB 6831). The question is approached differently if, in a given case, there is a complete and definitive severance of the employer-employee relationship (Digest 8.13.0), or where the conditions of non-application, as provided in the exempting clause of the labour dispute provisions, are fulfilled.\nA good example would be the teaching field. To determine whether benefits are payable to a teacher during the non-teaching period, we must consider if the claimant has continuity of employment.  If they do, then the employer/employee relationship has not ceased and they are generally not entitled to benefits during the non-teaching period.  If there is a work stoppage attributable to a labour dispute, the appropriate disentitlement will also be imposed. If the labour dispute continues into the teaching period, then they are still subject to disentitlement as they are still involved in the labour dispute by virtue of their vested interest in the outcome of the labour dispute.\nIf their contract has terminated thereby proving they no longer have continuity of employment the disentitlement would not apply after the end date of the contract, as long as the claimant is not participating in, financing or directly interested in the labour dispute (CUB 26330).\nFinally, the stoppage of work may be considered to have come to an end when the settlement of the dispute occurs during the off-season, even if in fact the resumption of activities only occurs many months later (EI Regulation 53(1) and Digest 8.11.5). Attainment of the 85% minimum may be easily reached when calculated on the basis of a normal situation which represents a reduced, if not virtually nil level of work force and activities.",0.9225565

One is when the work stoppage ends, and the other is when the person gets a new job.

To start receiving benefits again, the person must prove they found a new job after losing their old one because of the work stoppage. It doesn't count if they were already working before. However, if they were working part-time before the stoppage and then started working full-time, or if their hours increased significantly, that can be considered for restarting benefits.",68.19572916666668,9.0471875,10.864195022040777,11.970833333333331,11.094010416666665,10.099374999999998,45.55208333333333,5.166666666666667,0.843776535987854,0.8114749044179916,3.196294565649404,0.7837105027536171,0.3611077094948062,0.0585709504173393,4.640625,4.0,2.380698344892733,21.33333333333333,22.0,6.774133810967191,1.3828125,1.0,0.6860335923580929,128,80,0.625,613,6,8.12.0,Other employment during the stoppage of work,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes,"The termination of the stoppage of work is not the only factor to  consider when deciding whether a disentitlement should be terminated (Digest  8.1.8).

Employment  or a period of employment that preceded the time when the claimant lost or was  unable to resume a previous employment will not provide relief in this context (CUB  64431).

584,584,584,"Being hired by an employer doesn't mean a person is regularly working; they must have a set work schedule in a new job. If the job is so short that it's hard to know if it will continue, it's not regular work, but more like temporary work. Different court decisions have helped determine this. The main rules come from some judgments of the Federal Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court (S.C.C. 1669883, FCA A-1198-84, CUB 9488, FCA A-765-85, CUB 76911A).

These judgments say that to know if someone was regularly employed, three things need to be true:

1. It must be real and serious work.
2. The work must continue without breaks.
3. The work must follow a regular schedule.

Real and serious work means knowing how much work there will be at certain times. It's not real if the amount of work is unclear, just when needed, or if it's uncertain if the work will last. 

Having worked for a certain time doesn't prove the job met the first rule if there was no assurance of work either when hired or during the job.

Continuity means the work went on without breaks, like layoffs or contract endings, without needing to be re-hired. It's not continuous if the work was irregular or on-call.

Regularity in work means following a specific schedule or working a certain number of hours regularly. This pattern can be different for each person.

To prove regular work, all three rules must be met. If someone planned to go back to their old job after the new one ended, it might show they were regularly employed elsewhere. This doesn't affect whether the recent job was regular. The person doesn't have to show they disconnected from their previous job to prove their new job was regular.",80.09907692307694,5.962589743589742,10.008157457239328,9.95794871794872,6.5233653846153885,7.462179487179487,34.51025641025641,2.95,0.7248038414277529,0.7004115208983421,2.621344563764921,1.1278991516973085,0.454704228300612,0.0810112674651687,4.278846153846154,4.0,2.2019370730716306,15.6,15.5,7.908223567907017,1.310897435897436,1.0,0.6622682195370769,312,150,0.4807692307692308,1399,20,8.12.2,Regularly,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes,"To be hired with an employer does not necessarily mean a claimant is regularly  engaged; the claimant must work in the new occupation and have some form of  work schedule.  If the employment is only  intended for such a short time that it is impossible to determine its  continuity, it is not regular employment, but rather casual employment.  The application of the legislation has created  abundant jurisprudence and interpretations to support this.  The authoritative principles are found in several  judgments of the Federal Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court (S.C.C.  1669883, FCA  A-1198-84, CUB  9488 and FCA  A-765-85, CUB 76911A).\nBased on these judgments, the determination of whether a claimant was  regularly engaged in insurable employment will require that three criteria be  met. These are:\n\nwas it firm, serious, genuine employment;\nwas there continuity in the employment;\nwas there regularity in the claimant's pattern of work?\n\nAn employment will be firm, serious, and genuine when, at a given time,  the worker has some assurance of a certain number of predetermined work  periods. It would not be so where;\n\nthere is no such assurance,\nthe proposed number of work  periods is vague, imprecise, not defined, or uncertain,\nit is on an as-needed basis  only,\nit is unknown whether the  employment will continue or in what manner from day to day (CUB  64431). \n\nThe fact that the claimant has worked a certain number of periods does  not demonstrate after the fact that the employment meets the first criterion,  if such an assurance did not exist either at the time of hiring or at some  subsequent time during the employment.\nThere must also have been continuity in the employment. This means that  it was pursued uninterrupted, that is, without a lay-off, end of contract or  break in the employer-employee relationship, even for a short period which  required a re-employment. Continuity will not be shown when the employment had  been for an intermittent, sporadic, occasional or on-call basis (CUB  64431 and CUB  55172).\nThere must be regularity in the pattern of work. Generally, this means  that the claimant worked according to a specific pattern, in terms of a  schedule, a number of given hours or days, and that this pattern regularly  repeated itself during the pursued employment (CUB  64431). What needs to be determined at this stage is what pattern of work over  an interval is representative of the claimant's employment.\nAn interval could vary from case to case. One could conclude that in the  majority of cases, an interval of one week, that is, a period of seven days  starting on any day, would be representative of an interval of the employment  under question. This interval could be longer or shorter. In the case of a  person who was engaged to work one week in two, then two weeks would constitute  a representative interval.\nOnce the representative interval is established, what must be examined  is the pattern of work during this interval and in what way it was repeated  during the period of employment. At the very minimum, one could consider that  there was regularity in the pattern of work when, during the claimant's  employment, that specific pattern prevailed for at least two successive intervals,  which would be for at least two successive intervals of seven days in the  majority of cases. It could just as easily be a pattern of part-time work rather  than full-time.\nThe fact that the person had been employed, or even that they had  worked, is not sufficient. What is required, is the fulfillment of all three  criteria previously mentioned.\nIf a claimant had intended to resume the previous employment at the end  of the stoppage of work, rather than remain employed at the most recent  employment, this may be sufficient to show that the claimant was regularly  engaged in other employment (CUB  39266). This factor has no bearing on the regularity of the  employment in question. It is therefore not a question of demanding that the  claimant demonstrate disinterest, distance or detachment from the outcome of  the labour dispute by severing all connection with the labour dispute employer.",0.9971295
585,585,585,"No matter what time of the year it is, most companies go through changes in their workforce. This is also true during a labor dispute, especially if work has stopped for a long time. There are several reasons why employees might not come back to work after the dispute ends. This could be because their job was temporary, ending soon, or because they were laid off, fired, quit, or retired during the dispute.

The important question here is why the employee isn't going back to work, not just why they are currently unemployed. If an employee can't go back to work because of a labor dispute, they may not be able to get benefits. There are some exceptions to this rule, but they only apply in specific situations that are mentioned in the law. Even if an employee would have lost their job for a different reason if work hadn't stopped, they may still be disqualified from getting benefits.

However, if an employee meets certain conditions mentioned in the law, they may not be disqualified from getting benefits, even if they lost their job or couldn't return to work due to the labor dispute. If an employee later proves that they meet these conditions during the dispute, they might no longer be disqualified from benefits. It's important to remember that if an employee qualifies for an exemption from disqualification, they still need to meet all other requirements to receive benefits. This includes having worked the necessary number of hours, having a valid reason for leaving their job, and being available for work.",63.69363636363637,9.840757575757577,12.602617957971052,13.8,11.42511363636364,10.138636363636364,45.48484848484848,5.166666666666667,0.8576438697901639,0.8777704536914825,3.0456683716194792,0.4103326968191184,0.4342200122614366,0.0687036934145648,4.640151515151516,4.0,2.5202320674915746,22.0,21.0,4.949747468305833,1.428030303030303,1.0,0.7800363622001564,264,128,0.4848484848484848,1269,12,8.13.0,Termination of employment during a work stoppage,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes,"No matter what time of the year or what the field of activities, it is  inevitable that most firms do experience some movement on the part of their  work force. The same is true during a labour dispute, and even more so when the  stoppage of work lasts a long time. There are many reasons why employees, who  were part of the work force when the stoppage of work began or who would have  resumed their employment during the stoppage of work, may not return to work  once the dispute is over. For example, because the employment was temporary or  about to terminate, or there has been a lay-off, dismissal, resignation or  retirement, during the stoppage of work.\nThe question to be asked in this regard is why the claimant is not  returning to their place of employment and not, why is the claimant unemployed  at the present time. Once a claimant has lost or is unable to resume employment  for reasons related to a labour dispute, they are disentitled from benefits (EI Act 36(1)).\nAn exemption is possible only when one of the two circumstances set  forth in the legislation apply (EI Act 36(1)). This is so  even if, were it not for the stoppage of work, the claimant would have lost  employment for another reason (FCA  A-181-83,  CUB 7842 and FCA  A-209-04, CUB  59992).\nHowever, the claimant may still satisfy the exempting conditions (EI Act 36(4) and Digest  8.1.4), in which case a disentitlement may not be imposed, even  though the claimant has lost an employment or is unable to resume a previous employment,  due to the stoppage of work. It is possible for the disentitlement to no longer  apply if the claimant subsequently proves the existence of these exempting  conditions during the stoppage of work.  In  this case the disentitlement would be terminated on the day prior to the  fulfillment of these conditions (FCA  A-942-85, CUB 11403 and FCA  A-814-91, CUB 20138).  It is also important to note that if the  claimant does meet the criteria to be exempt from a disentitlement, they must  also meet all other entitlement provisions to receive benefits.  These other entitlement provisions include, but  are not limited to, having the required number of hours to establish a claim, having  a valid reason for separation, meeting availability criteria.",0.97074604
586,586,586,"When someone loses their benefits due to a labor dispute, just because the relationship between them and their employer has ended doesn't mean they automatically get those benefits back. What matters is whether the person is actively involved in the dispute by supporting it financially or taking part in it. Some signs that the separation between the person and their employer is final include the person no longer working there, getting any money owed to them after leaving, losing benefits related to the job, no longer having the option to come back to work, and the reasons behind the separation. 

If the separation is not because of any unfair practices during the dispute, and the person is still connected to the employer in some way, they may not be entitled to benefits. Even if the person no longer works for the employer, if they are still involved in the issues of the labor dispute, they may not be eligible for benefits. 

In situations like construction or logging where employees work for different companies in a year and the industry is facing a dispute, even if someone quits one employer, if they continue to be involved or support the ongoing dispute in the industry, they may not be eligible for benefits. 

Basically, to receive benefits after losing them due to a labor dispute, the person should not have any financial or active involvement in the dispute anymore, even if they are no longer working for the employer.",46.37819277108436,15.627435456110156,14.95560836045872,19.04784853700516,18.56270223752152,11.091244979919676,62.88066551921973,9.714285714285714,0.923029194275538,0.9441531658172608,3.6727328557685697,0.6166257038096971,0.4433621933621934,0.061199725496008,4.714859437751004,4.0,2.4971912093521285,35.57142857142857,32.0,10.321366781821968,1.4698795180722892,1.0,0.7552336705488517,249,110,0.4417670682730923,1199,7,8.13.1,Complete and final severance of the employer-employee relationship,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes,"When a claimant is disentitled from benefits pursuant to the labour  dispute provisions (EI Act 36(1)), there is  no automatic re-entitlement simply because the employer-employee relationship  has been completely and finally severed (FCA  A-814-91, CUB 20138, FCA  A-270-91, CUB 19037, FCA  A-942-85, CUB 11403 and FCA  A-741-87, CUB 14021).\nWhile there may be a complete and definitive severance of the  employer-employee relationship, it is not the rupture itself that is the  deciding factor leading to entitlement, but rather it is the absence of direct  interest, participation, and financing in the labour dispute, on the part of  the claimant (EI Act 36(4) and Digest  8.1.4).\nMoreover, such a separation is not necessary when the claimant otherwise  meets the exempting conditions, even while still maintaining, to some degree,  the employer-employee ties. On the other hand, there could be a complete and  definitive separation, but the direct interest, participation or financing  continue to be present. One of the questions to determine is whether the  severance is complete and final. This may not always be the case, even if the  employee has in fact informed the employer of their intention to resign, or if  the employer has notified the employee of a dismissal. The severance may only be  temporary and may last only until the dispute is resolved and operations resume.\nA number of indicators may confirm whether the severance is final:\n\ntermination of individual employment,\npayment of amounts due on termination of employment,\nloss of all rights of recall and employment-related benefits,\nthe employee's status in the company,\nthe reasons for severance given by the employer (e.g. incompetence,       misconduct not related to the dispute) or by the claimant (ill health, relocation).\n\nThe separation must not be the result of actions or intimidation  practices that often occur in labour disputes, or actions whose sole purpose is  to create entitlement to benefits.\nOther indicators may also cast doubt on the complete and final nature of  the severance, such as:\n\nthe simultaneous resignation or lay-off of several workers,\na long period of employment tied in with substantial benefits (such       as a pension),\nthe fact that neither the employer nor the employee have taken       appropriate steps to make the termination of employment final, or,\nthe claimant is still a member of the union in dispute with the       employer (FCA       A-139-88, CUB       14613).\n\nEven if the termination of employment appears to be a final severance,  it can happen that the claimant remains directly interested in the outcome of  the dispute or continues to be involved. For example, an employee who used all  avenues of recourse to ensure that their return to work is possible, or where,  because of the reasons giving rise to the separation, it is highly likely that  this worker's return forms part of the back-to-work agreement (FCA  A-209-04, CUB  59992).\nIt cannot be said that a claimant who was dismissed during a stoppage of  work is not directly interested in the labour dispute, as long as there is the  possibility that they will subsequently return to work as a result of a return  to work protocol, or as a result of a grievance filed against the dismissal.  The fact that, following either the termination of the stoppage of work or a  judgment issued on a grievance, a worker will not be reinstated, does not  change the direct interest that the claimant had in the labour dispute, before  the final decision concerning their employment, was made. In such a case, the  disentitlement will not be retroactively terminated to the date of the  dismissal.\nIt may happen, in the case of a dispute impacting such industries as  construction or logging, that an employee, who has been principally employed in  this occupation by several employers in the course of a year, and whose working  conditions are usually subject to general rather than to local agreements, decides  to quit employment with a specific employer, in the course of a generalized  stoppage of work in the industry. Even though such a termination of employment  may prove to be final, the employee nonetheless remains directly interested in  the outcome of the dispute affecting the industry and may also continue to  finance and participate in the dispute. Unless the employee has also decided to  no longer work in this industry (such as for reasons of retirement, health or  career change), it cannot be concluded that all the exempting conditions are met.\nParticipating or financing, like direct interest, do not necessarily  cease with the termination of employment, even where the severance proves to be  final. A claimant may for one reason or another continue to participate in the  dispute or finance it. In either case the exempting conditions are deemed not  to be met (EI Act 36(4), Digest  8.1.4; FCA  A-209-04, CUB  59992).",0.9857625
587,587,587,"When someone is working a temporary job and the end date is already known, it doesn't automatically mean they meet all the rules for getting Employment Insurance (EI) benefits on the day the job was supposed to finish. Different things can happen, like if there is a work stoppage due to a disagreement between workers and their employer. In these situations, the end date of the job might change either earlier or later.

Sometimes, due to delays caused by the work stoppage, the employer might try to keep a worker for longer or delay laying them off because they might need the worker when the work starts again. This can happen if they have to replace another worker who can't come back from a break, or if they think the worker is valuable and they want to keep them for a permanent job in the future.

In some cases, temporary workers might have a right to come back to work based on a union agreement, a contract, or other rules, even if there's a work stoppage. This often happens with seasonal workers.

Just because a temporary job was supposed to end soon, it doesn't mean the job would have ended during the work stoppage, leading to a definite end of the worker's relationship with the employer. Because of this, simply saying the job would have ended soon is not enough to prove the worker should still get EI benefits. The worker must show they had no direct interest, involvement, or financial backing at a specific time to be excused from disqualification.

If a term worker is let go right before a work stoppage because of a labor dispute and their job ended completely with no hopes of being hired back after the dispute is over, they might be excused from losing their EI benefits. It must be clear that the job ending is final and that there's no promise or likelihood of being rehired once the issue is resolved.",65.10658783783786,11.07213963963964,11.20814326018867,13.982882882882883,13.18031531531532,9.019459459459458,46.36861861861862,5.166666666666667,0.8870119940150868,0.8793274521827698,2.9620092203231736,0.6042864360690334,0.4414967674708596,0.0457380201394507,4.402402402402402,4.0,2.3672427151237665,27.75,27.5,10.174518825641504,1.3423423423423424,1.0,0.6688544574151563,333,157,0.4714714714714714,1511,12,8.13.2,Temporary employment or employment about to terminate,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes,"Even when the employment in question is strictly temporary, with its  duration known in advance, it must not be taken for granted that the claimant  meets the requirements of the exempting conditions on the predetermined date where  the employment would have ended (EI Act 36(4); Digest  8.5.10). Depending on the circumstances, there are many factors at  play, including the fact that there is an ongoing stoppage of work attributable  to a labour dispute. These factors may modify the situation, thereby advancing  or postponing the originally set date of departure.\nDue to operational delays caused by the stoppage of work, it is possible  that the employer will attempt to extend an individual's period of employment,  or to postpone the planned lay-off date because of the anticipated need for the  employee's services when operations resume. It is not uncommon for the  temporary employment to be extended because the employer needs staff to replace  an employee who was supposed to return from leave but was unable to do so, or  because the employer feels that this is a skilled worker whom they wish to  retain, with a view to a permanent position in the future.\nOn occasion, temporary employees retain a right of recall under the  provisions of a collective agreement, or an agreement or  contract of service, despite the stoppage of  work.  This is often the situation in the  case of seasonal workers.\nThis means that the mere possibility or a simple statement that the  employment would have terminated in the near future, is not by itself  sufficient to conclude that the employment would have terminated during the  stoppage, and that there would have been a complete and definitive severance of  the employer-employee relationship (FCA  A-942-85, CUB 11403, and FCA  A-139-88, CUB 14613; Digest  8.13.0 and Digest  8.13.1).\nA worker in this situation cannot gain relief from disentitlement on  these grounds alone (Digest  8.13.0 and Digest  8.13.1; FCA  -181-83, CUB  7842). Nor can they be exempted from it unless it is proven that  at a precise date there is, on their part, an absence of direct interest,  participation and financing (EI Act 36(4) and  Digest  8.1.4).\nFinally, term employees discharged on the eve of a stoppage of work  attributable to a labour dispute could be exempted from disentitlement to  benefits, if they suffered a complete severance of the employee-employer  relationship (FCA  A-594-91, CUB  19771). Such an eventuality implies that the severance is complete and final,  not of a temporary nature, that there exist no recall rights, and there is no promise  or pattern of employment that guarantees they will be rehired once the dispute  is settled (FCA  A-1198-82, CUB  7454).",0.98248035

If, on the other hand, the resignation is  genuine and is formally submitted to the employer, it may result in a complete  and definitive severance of the employer-employee relationship (FCA A-942-85 and FCA A-181-83, CUB  7842, CUB 11403; Digest 8.13.1).

Claimants must also prove that no circumstances or conditions exist that could result in disentitling or disqualifying them from receiving benefits (EI Act 49(1)).\nThe legislation has always been intended to provide relief to insured persons who are involuntarily unemployed until they are able to find comparable employment (CUB 62318,  CUB 76022). There are a number of provisions in the legislation that address these  concepts, including a provision that requires claimants to apply for, accept  and take advantage of job vacancies or other opportunities for suitable  employment. More specifically, section 27(1) of the EIA indicates:\nA claimant is disqualified from receiving benefits under this Part if, without good cause since the interruption of earnings giving rise to the claim, the claimant:\n\nhas not applied for a suitable employment that is vacant after becoming aware that it is vacant or becoming vacant, or has failed to accept the employment after it has been offered to the claimant\nhas not taken advantage of an opportunity for suitable employment\nhas not carried out a written direction given to the claimant by the Commission with a view to assisting the claimant to find suitable employment, if the direction was reasonable having regard both to the claimant's circumstances and to the usual means of obtaining that employment, or\nhas not attended an interview that the Commission has directed the claimant to attend to enable the Commission or another appropriate agency:\r\n          \nto provide information and instruction to help the claimant find employment, or\nto identify whether the claimant might be assisted by job training or other employment assistance\n\n\n\nOther provisions in the legislation require claimants to prove that they  are capable of and available for work and unable to obtain suitable employment  (EI Act 18(1)). For  this purpose the Commission may require the claimant to prove that they are  making reasonable and customary efforts to obtain suitable employment (EI Act 50(8)).\nGenerally, those claiming regular benefits are required to seek and  accept all opportunities for suitable employment. Claimants are not expected to  seek or accept employment that is not suitable.\nThe majority of this chapter deals with a claimant's expectations to apply  for, accept, or take advantage of opportunities for suitable employment. Employment that is not suitable is defined in section 6(4) of the EIA. The elements of suitable employment as they relate to the issue of availability  for work are discussed in chapter 10 of this Digest.\nAs will be discussed later in this chapter, claimants are also expected to  explore and/or accept assistance in obtaining suitable employment, by carrying  out written directions of the Commission, attending scheduled interviews, and  attending any course, training program or employment activity to which they  have been referred by the Commission or an authorized representative (EI Act 27(1)(c) and (d) and 27(1.1)).

593,593,593,"When your previous boss offers you a job again, it can be tricky to tell if you refused the job or if you quit on your own. Before deciding if you refused the work or quit, it's important to carefully look at all the details of the situation. If you've never worked for the employer who offered you the job before, then it's considered a refusal. Employment means the relationship between an employer and an employee. If you could have continued working without a break but you refused, like turning down a new contract or transfer, then it's seen as leaving on your own. If you donâ€™t go back to work after a break, like after a layoff or dispute settlement, it's also seen as leaving on your own. Sometimes people try out a job before deciding to leave because they don't like the duties or conditions. This is also considered leaving on your own. Refusing to work for any employer, in Canada or elsewhere, can disqualify you from benefits for 7 to 12 weeks. Refusing more than one job opportunity with the same employer can lead to disqualifications. But usually, only two disqualifications are given at once.

A detailed review of all the facts of the case must be conducted before a decision is made whether a refusal is considered a voluntary leaving, or if it is in fact a refusal of employment. Where the employment opportunity is with an employer for whom the claimant has never before worked, the case is clearly one of refusal of employment.\nThe word employment is defined as the act of employing or the  state of being employed (EI Act 2(1)); it  therefore refers to that relationship which exists between an employer and an  employee. The inference is that the question will be one of voluntarily leaving  employment where the employer-employee relationship could have been maintained  without a break had the claimant accepted the opportunity to work; examples are  the refusal to accept a renewal of a contract of employment, or to accept a  transfer (EI Act 29(b.1)(i) and (iii)). Essentially,  if the refusal results in a complete severance of the employer-employee  relationship, the refusal will be considered under the principles of a  voluntary leaving (Digest   6).\nThe issue is also one of voluntarily leaving employment where the claimant refuses to return to work following a gap, such as after a lay-off; upon settlement of a labour dispute; or at the end of a leave of absence without pay (EI Act 29(b.1)(ii)).\nOccasionally, instead of immediately refusing an offer of employment, a claimant may decide to try it out. These cases are treated as voluntarily leaving employment if the claimant, after having accepted employment, decides to leave the job because the duties or the working conditions turned out to be unacceptable to them (FCA A-57-06, CUB  65058A, CUB 67121, CUB 67365).\nOther than self-employment, the definition of employment is not restrictive, in the context of refusing employment. Any refusal to work in suitable employment for an employer, whether the employment is insurable, or whether it is in Canada or abroad, may lead to a 7 to 12 week disqualification. Although service in the Canadian Forces is employment, a refusal to enlist or re-enlist will not result in a disqualification.\nIf  more than 1 opportunity of employment is refused, each refusal may result in  a separate disqualification, even where such opportunities are with the same  employer (FCA A-928-96, CUB 35473). However, in  practice, a maximum of 2 disqualifications will be applied where several  opportunities of employment are refused at the same time. What is to be  considered is any refusal of employment which has occurred since the  interruption of earnings giving rise to the claim for benefit, even when the  refusal precedes the claim itself.\nA claimant who, without good cause and since the interruption of earnings giving  rise to the claim, has not carried out a written direction given to them by the  Commission or an authority that the Commission designates, with a view to  assisting the claimant to find suitable employment, will be subject to a disqualification. The same is true where  a claimant has not attended an interview that the Commission or designated  authority has directed the claimant to attend, to provide information and  instruction to help the claimant find employment, or to identify whether the  claimant might be assisted by job training (EI Act 27(1)(c) and (d)).\nA claimant is also subject to a disqualification if the claimant has been  referred to a course or employment activity and the Commission or designated  authority has terminated the referral because, without good cause, the claimant  has not attended or participated in the course or activity, and is unlikely to  successfully complete it; the claimant has, without good cause, withdrawn from  the course or activity, or the organization providing the course or activity; has expelled the claimant (EI Act 27(1.1)).",0.7723051

598,598,598,"Instead of waiting for a job offer and saying no right away, a person might go to an interview and talk about their future plans, which might not be what the employer wants. In situations like these, even though no job offer was actually made, what matters is how interested the person is and how they act towards the opportunity.

People who are looking for a job are expected to take advantage of any suitable job opportunity or make good use of any chance that could lead to getting a job quickly. They do this by showing interest and being careful when dealing with potential employers, and by behaving in a way that will make employers want to hire them. If a person doesn't show up for an interview or talks during the interview about their future plans which don't match what the employer needs, it can be seen as refusing the job.

Acting like a haggler over the job offered, asking for more money than what's usually paid, having restrictions on hours or type of work, or being late for the interview are examples of not showing enough interest or care in finding work. The same goes for people who put conditions on their hiring during the interview to try to stop an employer from offering them a job.

This also applies to people who are laid off from seasonal jobs (like school-related work). While they might know they can go back when the season starts again, they should still act interested and careful when looking for work during the off-season because some employers might need temporary help. It's the employer's decision whether to hire them or not.

Declaring that you are only available for a short time because you're waiting for a better job is not always considered refusing a job. Sometimes employers need new workers to stay for a while for training or other reasons. Being honest about future plans won't always work against a person. Before stopping someone from getting benefits, all the details of a situation need to be looked at.

Lastly, if a person is aware of a job opportunity but doesn't make an effort to get it, it can be seen as not taking advantage of a job opportunity. Not going back to work after a layoff or after taking time off, which leads to the end of the job, is seen as leaving the job voluntarily, not refusing it.",65.52404891304349,10.548109903381649,11.698219412168324,13.82826086956522,12.122282608695649,8.791690821256037,44.71557971014493,4.875,0.8442590514818827,0.8644133763653892,2.9253084420542224,0.4880640885614009,0.466352040494246,0.0496992636628906,4.376811594202898,4.0,2.296404136834877,25.875,28.0,8.92240858737146,1.359903381642512,1.0,0.6727519303183147,414,192,0.463768115942029,1869,16,9.2.3,Has not taken advantage of  an opportunity,Chapter 9 - Refusal of employment,"Rather  than wait for an offer of employment and flatly refuse the offer, a person  might report for an interview and reveal future intentions which do not meet  the prospective employer's needs. In these situations, although, a frequent  contention is that there was no refusal of employment since no actual offer of  employment was made, it is the claimant's level of interest and behaviour  towards the opportunity that must be examined.\nClaimants  are expected to take advantage of any opportunity of suitable employment, or  make good use of any favourable circumstances that might lead to immediate  re-employment. They do so by showing interest and prudence in their dealings  with potential employers, and by acting in a way that will encourage, rather  than discourage employers from offering them suitable employment. Where  claimants fail to report for an interview or, during the course of an  interview, either voluntarily reveal future intentions which may not meet the  employer's needs, or indicate an unwillingness to accept the conditions offered  by the prospective employer, it may be said that a refusal of employment has  occurred (CUB 57919).  More specifically, the applicant is said to have not taken advantage of  an opportunity for suitable employment.\nThe expression has not taken advantage of an opportunity includes  situations where a claimant does not display the interest and prudence which  are to be expected from someone desirous of finding work as soon as possible.  This could include haggling over the employment offered, demanding a salary  which is higher than the starting rate for that type of work, restricting to  certain hours or to a certain type of work, or arriving late for the interview  (EI Act 27(1)(b)). Likewise, interest and prudence  are not shown by those who deliberately impose conditions on their hiring  during an interview (for example, vacations planned in the future, availability  limited to specific times, restricted to temporary employment), with the intent  to discourage an employer from offering them employment.\nThis  is also the case for claimants who have been laid off from seasonal employment  (including school related occupations). Claimants seeking work during their  off-season are free to disclose their intention to return to their normal  occupation when the season resumes. Although they may have an assurance of  returning to their seasonal employment, claimants seeking work during their  off-season are expected to act in a manner that shows interest and prudence,  and which will not discourage prospective employers from offering them  employment. In fact, some employers may be looking for casual or temporary  assistance and hiring a seasonal worker during their off-season may be ideal.  It is up to the employer whether they will or will not hire an individual.\nA  refusal of employment will not always be said to occur where the claimant  advises the employer that they are available for only a limited period of time,  for reasons previously mentioned or because they are waiting for better  employment to become available. In some cases, employers may require new employees  to stay in their employ for a reasonable period of time, whether it is to  justify training expenses or for other reasons. The fact that a person has  acted out of honesty in disclosing future intentions would not automatically be  held against them. In these cases, claimants will not automatically be  disqualified from receiving benefits for the sole reason that they honestly  declare to their prospective employer that they intended to return to their  seasonal employment. Before a disqualification from benefits is imposed, all  circumstances of the case must be assessed.\nFinally,  there are cases where a person is neither offered nor referred to employment  but nevertheless has personal knowledge of an employment opportunity. A claimant  who fails to take reasonable steps to obtain the employment can be said to have  not taken advantage of an opportunity for suitable employment.  However, failing to resume an employment (EI Act  29(b.1)(ii)) at the end of  a lay-off period or at the end of a period of leave, which results in the  severance of the employee-employer relationship, is considered voluntarily  leaving employment and not a refusal of employment.",0.9954645
599,599,599,"The claimant can find out about a job opening in different ways, like being told by someone or when looking for jobs on their own. If there's a disagreement over a job offer or if the claimant didn't get all the necessary information, the Commission will investigate what really happened. Just saying that you didn't know about a job opportunity isn't good enough if you didn't ask for more details about the job or if you turned it down before knowing everything about it.

Phone calls are still a common way to communicate. If a claimant says they didn't get a phone call, didn't get a message, or didn't understand it, then it's a matter of figuring out who is telling the truth.

When the Commission sends a notice by mail, it's assumed that the claimant got it unless there's a good reason to think otherwise. Claimants who are getting benefits should expect to hear from the Commission and should make sure they're reachable.

If  there is a contention that there was a misunderstanding regarding an offer of  employment or its refusal, or that all essential information was not provided  to the claimant, the Commission must clarify the actual events.\nAn  argument that one was not properly notified of the possibility of employment is  not sufficient, where a claimant does not bother to ask for the particulars of  the job, or where a claimant expresses their refusal before being given all the  particulars (CUB 57919).\nThe  telephone, among other methods, is still a proper and normal means of  communication. Where the claimant contends they did not receive a telephone call,  were not given a message, or did not understand the message, the question  becomes one of credibility.\nProvided  there is evidence supporting its issuance, any notice by mail is presumed to  have been received by the addressee in the ordinary course of mail delivery (EI Act  134(2)). Further, claimants should  reasonably know that, being unemployed and in receipt of benefits, they are  likely to receive notifications from the Commission. It is reasonable to expect  claimants to take the necessary steps to ensure that they can be contacted  without delay.\nThus,  for claimants who do not pick up their mail every day or who absent themselves  from their residence without telling the Commission, it will be considered that  the notice was nevertheless received, although there may be extenuating  circumstances present.

If a person mentions health problems as the reason for not taking a job, they might need medical proof. But if they can give good reasons or evidence based on their experiences without needing a doctor's opinion, that could also be considered. Being pregnant doesn't automatically mean a person can't work, except when they are claiming maternity benefits. If a pregnant person is offered a job while claiming regular benefits, they should consider taking it even if it's only for a few months, and they should communicate with the employer.

Specifically, EIR 9.002(1)(a) states, the claimant's health and physical  capabilities allow them to commute to the place of work and perform the  work.\nConsequently, throughout the duration of the claim, whether the claimant's health and physical capabilities allow the claimant to commute to the place of work and perform the work involved, must be examined to determine if employment is suitable.\nIn many cases, particularly when the claimant has performed the potential employment under similar or identical circumstances in the past, it may be difficult for them to prove the employment was not suitable. However, each situation must still be examined on its own merits, particularly if the claimant indicates that their health or physical capabilities were a factor in refusing the employment. The Commission must obtain all relevant facts to determine the extent to which the claimant's health and capabilities prevented them from pursuing the employment.\nIf health reasons or physical capabilities place significant limitations on a claimant's ability to accept specific types of work, working conditions (including heavy or outside work or other aggravating conditions), hours of work (including shift work and night work) or daily commuting distance, then the employment becomes unsuitable.\nWhen a claimant indicates health or physical capabilities as the reason for not pursuing otherwise suitable employment, it may have to be supported by medical evidence. However, detailed and convincing explanations, first-hand observations, previous employment modifications and plausible or credible statements, including evidence concerning the claimant's age and previous work experience, may be acceptable when a physician has not been consulted.\n Pregnancy does not in itself render a person incapable of work and  therefore not available for work. Any employment offered during a period where  the claimant is claiming EI maternity benefits is not suitable. However, a  claimant's pregnancy does not render an otherwise suitable employment  unsuitable, if the claimant is claiming regular benefits. Consequently, an  offer of permanent work may be suitable for a pregnant claimant who is  available for only a few months; rather than refuse the opportunity outright  she should contact the employer and allow the employer to decide whether or not  to hire her. A claimant who refuses to return to work after the end of her maternity  leave is considered to have voluntarily left employment (EI Act 29(b)(1)(ii); Digest 6.3.6). Entitlement to regular EI benefits, if  requested, would be considered based on the voluntary leaving provisions as this  situation does not fall under the job refusal provisions.",0.92543423
603,603,603,"The hours you have to work at a job need to fit well with your family responsibilities or religious beliefs. This is an important factor in deciding if a job is suitable for you. You might need to work full-time, part-time, evenings, nights, or do shift work. Sometimes, you might have to work long hours or overtime. You are generally expected to be open to different work schedules, unless they conflict with your family duties.

If a job's hours don't work with your family responsibilities or religious beliefs, you can try to arrange alternative care for your family or see if your employer can adjust the hours for you. However, it's ultimately your responsibility to make sure you can work the required hours. Not being able to find a solution might show that there's a problem with your availability.

If the hours or days of a job clash with your religious beliefs or if the job doesn't meet certain criteria for what's suitable, you might not have to take that job. For example, if you can only work part-time due to health reasons, or if the pay for a part-time job is so low that it would put you in a worse financial situation, then the job might not be right for you. 

Even if a job pays less than your previous job, it doesn't necessarily mean it's unsuitable. Accepting lower pay might be okay if there's a good reason for it.

Specifically, the EIR 9.002(1) states, the hours of work are not incompatible  with the claimant's family obligations or religious beliefs.\nThere is no reference in the legislation requiring a comparison of available hours of work to a claimant's previous pattern of work in the qualifying period. Consequently, with only a few exceptions, claimants are obligated to seek and accept any reasonable hours of work, including full-time, part-time, evenings, nights and shift work, as well as work that may involve inconvenient or long hours, or overtime.\nAs  an exception, hours of work are not suitable if they are incompatible with the  claimant's family obligations. In order to avoid such an incompatible  situation, and to establish their availability for work, claimants are expected  to make arrangements for the care of family members, in order to allow them to  accept the hours of work that are available in the labour market. In some  instances, it may even be possible to make arrangements with the employer to  adjust the hours of work in order to accommodate a claimant's circumstances.  However, the fact that the employer cannot adjust the hours of work to  accommodate the claimant would not necessarily render the employment  unsuitable. It is not the employer's responsibility to adjust the hours, but  rather it is the claimant's responsibility to be willing to accept all  reasonable hours of work. Inability or unwillingness to make every attempt to make  alternate care arrangements could be an indication that an availability issue  exists. Availability is a separate issue that is considered based on all of the  circumstances of the case, and discussed in chapter  10 of this Digest.\nThere may also be situations where certain hours of work or days of the week are incompatible with a claimant's religious beliefs. If accepting certain hours or days of work would be inconsistent with a particular religious belief or conviction, and again if it is not possible to adjust the hours or days of work, then the employment may be considered unsuitable.\nIn  addition, there may be circumstances where certain hours or even days of work  are not suitable because one of the other criteria for determining suitability  of employment is not met. For example, a claimant may be able to work on a  part-time basis as they are physically incapable of accepting work on a  full-time basis (EIR 9.002(1)); or the  offered earnings for intermittent part-time work could be such that the  claimant would be put in a less favourable financial situation by accepting the  employment. In these circumstances the employment may not be suitable.\nAn  offer of salary that is less than the salary last earned would not  automatically make the prospective employment unsuitable (CUB 80605).  This factor would nevertheless be taken into consideration in determining  whether there was good cause, should the employment be refused.\nThe  fact that the employer's hours of work are incompatible with a claimant's  family obligations or religious beliefs, and that the incompatibility cannot be  resolved by the claimant, may indicate that the claimant's willingness and/or  ability to work are doubtful or that there are severe limitations on the  claimant's availability (FCA A-479-94; Digest 10.7.0).  All cases will be considered based on all of the claimant's individual circumstances.",0.99490815
604,604,604,"The third way to decide if a job is suitable looks at whether the work goes against what someone believes is right or their religious views. This is about the individual person and not their past work schedule. It considers how the person feels during their entire time getting benefits.
If someone feels that the job doesn't match their morals or religion, the job duties, hours, conditions, and work environment are looked at closely. If any of these things clearly go against what the person believes, and the employer can't make changes to fit those beliefs, then the job is considered unsuitable.
Usually, the morals or religion should be widely accepted by society, not something personal. For example, some people might find it wrong to work in a place that processes meat. Or some might think it's against their beliefs to work on a religious day. These beliefs should be commonly recognized by society.

Specifically, EIR 9.002(1) states,  the nature of the work is not contrary to the claimant's moral  convictions or religious beliefs.\nThis is a criterion that is based on the claimant's personal situation and would not be based on  previous hours or pattern of work. What is considered is the individual circumstances of the claimant during the entire benefit period.\nWhen the claimant indicates that the nature of the work is contrary to their moral convictions or religious beliefs, it is the nature of the employment itself, the duties, hours, working conditions and environment that must be examined in this regard. It is only when one or more of these factors are clearly shown to be contrary to the claimant's moral convictions or religious beliefs, and that the employer is unwilling or unable to accommodate those convictions or beliefs, that the employment would be deemed unsuitable.\nGenerally, the moral conviction or religious beliefs should be those recognized by society at large, and not something that is unsubstantiated. For example, working in a meat processing plant may be morally reprehensible to some claimants. Likewise, being required to work on a religious day of observance may be clearly contrary to the religious beliefs of some.

On some occasions, employment may be found unsuitable because it is paid at a rate lower than the prevailing rate. Clearly, employment is not suitable if it is at a rate of earnings lower than that provided for in a decree, ordinance or other applicable legislation. On the other hand, a rate of earnings must not be regarded as unsuitable merely because it is lower than that paid by big companies, or that recognized by unions.\nIn this day and age, the rate of earnings and other working conditions of most employment are regulated, whether by labour agreement, by decree or by federal or provincial legislation. Employers who acknowledge their obligations and readily fulfill them should not be excluded as a good employer only because other employers offer more attractive working conditions.\nAll claimants are expected to seek and accept suitable employment while claiming regular benefits.

609,609,609,"When someone who is claiming benefits accepts a job offer, they should not end up with less money than they had before, when they were on benefits or during a specific time period. For instance, if a person is getting $400 per week in Employment Insurance (EI) benefits and is offered a job that pays $300 per week, after accounting for any money they make while on benefits, they would receive $250 in benefits. If expenses like transportation and child care cost more than $150 per week, which is half of what they earn at the new job, then taking the job might not be the best choice.

If the person doesn't take the job, they could still get $400 in EI benefits. But if they take the job and their weekly expenses are $125, they would end up with $425 ($250 in benefits plus $300 from the job minus $125 in expenses), which is better than sticking with just the benefits. However, if expenses are $175 per week, then they would end up with only $375, which is less than what they could get by just staying on benefits.

In the end, the decision on whether to accept a job offer or not depends on how much the person earned during their qualifying period. If they made $375 or less per week during that time, then a job that pays $375 or more per week would be a good choice. But if they made more than $375 per week during that time, then a job that pays only $375 per week might not be the best option.",71.34489121989125,11.202634032634034,10.504223727775692,14.80901320901321,12.73895881895882,6.089510489510488,42.966588966588965,3.555555555555556,0.8291365876793861,0.8031114169529506,3.547538065758617,0.8281986466350745,0.4197005031122583,0.060123255106361,3.881118881118881,4.0,2.005201315214661,31.77777777777778,31.0,8.403409067195128,1.2202797202797202,1.0,0.5519272578704021,286,112,0.3916083916083916,1142,9,9.3.4,Less favourable financial situation,Chapter 9 - Refusal of employment,"A claimant, by accepting the earnings offered by an employer, should not be put  in a less favourable financial situation in comparison with the less favourable of:\n\nthe financial  situation they were in while receiving benefits\nthe financial  situation they were in during their qualifying period\n\nFor  example, taking into account the claimant's EI benefits including any working  while on claim provisions, employment may not be suitable if accepting the  employment means that transportation and child care expenses are so high that  the claimant would be in a less favourable financial situation than the lesser  of what they are receiving on EI, and what they were earning during their qualifying  period.\nAssuming the claimant is normally entitled to $400.00 a week in EI benefits. If the claimant is offered employment earning $300.00 per week, after the working while on claim earnings of $150.00 are deducted, the claimant would receive $250.00 per week in EI benefits. However, if the claimant's transportation and child care expenses exceed $150.00 per week (or one-half of the offered earnings) the claimant could be in a less favourable financial situation by accepting the employment, therefore the employment may not be suitable.\nBy not accepting the employment this claimant could be entitled to $400.00 in EI benefits. By accepting employment with expenses of $125.00 per week, the claimant would net $425.00 (EI benefits of $250 + $300 employment income minus expenses of $125). With net earnings of $425.00, compared to $400.00 if the employment was refused, the claimant is in a more favourable situation by accepting the employment and so the employment remains suitable.\nHowever, if there were expenses of $175.00 per week, the claimant would net a total of only $375.00 (EI benefits of $250.00, + $300.00 in employment income minus expenses of $175.00). In this latter circumstance the net income of $375.00 would be less than the $400.00 the claimant could be entitled to by not accepting the employment, thereby putting the claimant in a less favourable financial situation and making the employment possibly unsuitable.\nThe Commission would then have to examine the financial situation the claimant was in during their qualifying period. If the claimant's net weekly earnings in the qualifying period had been $375.00 or less, then offered employment that nets $375.00 or more would remain suitable.

616,616,616,"When a job opportunity arises in a different location, and it's only temporary, families might not want to move entirely. In that case, they need to decide if it's better to accept or decline the job offer when considering the costs of traveling and maintaining two households.

Sometimes both partners work. If one location is better for the career of one partner, and the couple has already decided to live there, the other partner's job decisions may be influenced by this. It could be reasonable for someone to refuse a job far away if it means being apart from their partner for a long time. For example, it would be okay for someone to turn down a job that only allows them to see their partner on weekends.

If a couple chooses to live in an area with few job options, they might need to accept being apart if they both want to keep working.

The law doesn't say that people have to move to get a job, but they do have to apply for suitable jobs that are available or will soon be available, be ready to work, and make an effort to find work.

In certain industries like construction, mining, forestry, and seasonal work, workers might have to live away from their families for long periods. This is expected in these industries, as long as workers can still visit their families occasionally.

In these situations, people are expected to look for and accept suitable jobs in the area where they used to work, as long as they can still visit their families. For example, if a mining engineer from Saskatchewan loses their job and returns home, they should be open to finding work in Saskatchewan or their home province.

If immediate work isn't available in Saskatchewan and the engineer goes back home but can still visit their family, they should be willing to go back to work if called by their old job. Not being open to job opportunities may lead to losing benefits and could show that the person isn't available to work.",69.07579545454546,9.870827922077924,10.914260884657429,13.011688311688312,11.814581980519485,8.83125,43.60876623376623,4.642857142857143,0.8947075330294095,0.8617964933315913,2.7330011512258787,0.5299193671678099,0.4697968025916075,0.0688722633432819,4.389204545454546,4.0,2.40127746380154,25.142857142857142,26.0,8.467223721564253,1.3267045454545454,1.0,0.6644995067904816,352,154,0.4375,1594,14,9.5.3,Work away from spouse,Chapter 9 - Refusal of employment,"Moving  the entire family may not be desirable when the prospective employment at some  distance away is only temporary. The question then is whether it is more  reasonable to accept or refuse the offer, after considering the expenses  involved in travelling and maintaining 2 homes.\nIt  often happens that both spouses are in the labour market. Keeping in mind the  principles applicable to voluntarily leaving employment, it will be assumed,  unless there is an indication to the contrary, that the area in which the  couple resides is the one that favours the career of one of them, a decision  they have already made and which must be respected. Acceptance of employment by  the other spouse would be influenced by these factors. When by reason of such  decision, the latter refuses to accept work at a place so far away that the  couple would be required to live apart for long periods, the refusal may be  with good cause. For example, a claimant may have good cause in refusing  permanent employment that would only allow seeing the other partner on  weekends. Generally, it is expected that spouses live together on a continuing  basis; if economic factors keep them apart, the situation must be exceptional  and the separation of a short duration (Digest 6.5.3).\nHowever,  if a couple takes up residence in an area where there are virtually no job  opportunities, they must be prepared to accept periods of separation, if either  of them, or both, intend to remain in the labour market.\nThe legislation  does not specifically require claimants to move in order to accept suitable  employment. However, it does require claimants to: apply for and accept  suitable employment that is vacant or about to become vacant; take advantage of  any opportunity for suitable employment (EI Act 27(1)(a) and (b)); be available  for work (EI Act 18(1)); and make reasonable and customary efforts to obtain suitable  employment (EI Act 50(8)).\nIn some occupational fields such as construction, mining, forestry, shipping, or other  specialized occupations, as well as other temporary and seasonal employment, a  claimant may be required to live apart from a spouse, children or an  established home residence for long periods of time. Living away from home is a  condition that workers in particular industries are expected to endure at  certain times (CUB 63327).  When choosing to work in these types of occupations claimants must generally  accept having to live apart from their families for rather long periods of  time, as long as they are not prevented from visiting their families at  reasonable intervals (CUB 56814, CUB 56893).\nIn these types of situations, rather than be voluntarily unemployed, claimants are  expected to seek and accept all suitable employment opportunities that are  available in the area where their insurable employment was earned, assuming  again that by accepting any new employment in that area, they are not prevented  from visiting their families at reasonable intervals (CUB 78646, CUB 79985).  For example, a mining engineer who regularly lives apart from his family is  laid off from his employment in Saskatchewan. Given the nature of his chosen  profession, should he return to his home province, this claimant should be  willing to seek and accept all suitable employment opportunities that may arise  in Saskatchewan, as well as suitable opportunities in his home province.\nIf immediate suitable employment is not available in Saskatchewan and the claimant  returns to his home province and the claimant would not be prevented from  visiting his family at reasonable intervals, the claimant should be willing to  return to work, if recalled to his former place of employment in Saskatchewan. The  claimant should also be willing to work in other geographical areas. A failure  to seek and accept such employment may lead to a disqualification for job  refusal, and may also raise a presumption of non-availability for work.",0.96719366

This right does not provide any protection against restrictions often imposed  by unions on their own members; rather, the loss of the  right referred to in section 35 is intended to apply to the loss of a legal right  related to membership in a union and observance of lawful rules. It is not intended to apply to the  application of internal union policies, by-laws, constitutions, etc. that may  result in a claimant being threatened or in fact fined or expelled from their particular union.\nSection 35 of the EIA  is intended to  protect the legal right of a claimant to:\n\nbecome (or not become) a member of an association, organization or union\ncontinue to be a member and observe the lawful rules\n\nIn other words, claimants are not disqualified for  refusing employment when accepting that employment would cause them to lose  their right to join a union, quit a union or to refuse membership in a union.\nConsequently,  a refusal of otherwise suitable employment is with good cause only when  acceptance of the prospective employment means the claimant would lose the  right to become a member of the union which one wishes to join, or to continue  to be a member and observe its lawful rules, or to refrain from becoming a member of the union recognized at the employer's place of business.

Similarly, if you refuse a short job thinking it might affect your chances at a better job later, that's not a good enough reason to refuse it.",79.0331378522468,8.026072607260726,9.057496981413337,11.171261741558771,8.86176694592536,6.197755775577559,34.528814419903526,2.6153846153846154,0.8724636634190878,0.8693088726563887,2.82044613506152,0.4893736855577036,0.4079168598151227,0.0635631299094132,3.957095709570957,4.0,2.0102396653861505,23.307692307692307,24.0,7.75970474641138,1.231023102310231,1.0,0.5564751834801976,303,130,0.429042904290429,1253,13,9.5.9.2,Promise of employment,Chapter 9 - Refusal of employment,"The  assurance of obtaining better paying, full-time employment in the immediate  future may amount to good cause for refusing an offer of suitable employment.  What is required is not an absolute certainty but a reasonable assurance that  another employment will materialize as promised. There must be an actual offer  of employment, including some type of assurance, and it must come directly from  the employer. As a general rule, any statement by the claimant to this effect  should be supported by documentary evidence; the fact that one subsequently  obtained the employment within the expected time may serve as an indication  that there was a promise of employment.\nWhat  is meant by immediate future is a period of up to 4 weeks from the date the  job was offered. However, regardless of the length of time between the offer  and the start date of employment, all factors must still be considered when  determining if good cause exists for the refusal. If the other employment is not  starting immediately, the Commission would also have to examine whether or not  the claimant's availability for work is still in order (Digest  10.8.2).\nSituations  may occur where the claimant has accepted employment with 1 employer, but the  start date is more than 4 weeks after the date the job offer was made. Should the claimant receive an offer from  another employer prior to starting the first job, the claimant should explore  the possibility of refusing the first employer, in order to immediately put an  end to their period of unemployment. All terms and conditions of both offers would need to be reviewed before determining  whether good cause existed, if the claimant refuses the second offer.\nSituations  may also occur where there is an assurance of higher paying full time  self-employment in the immediate future. Again, what must be examined is  whether or not this employment will commence within 4 weeks from the date of  the job offer.\nA  promise of other employment of short duration or a promise of a recall to  seasonal work is not good cause to refuse an offer of employment, where the  offered employment would be of long duration. Little weight will be given to a  promise of employment if, when the time comes, the claimant does not accept  that very employment. On the other hand, good cause is not shown where  acceptance of employment offered for a short duration (for example, 2 to 3 weeks) would not jeopardize the possibility of later obtaining the desired employment.",0.9635849

The length of disqualification will depend on the reasons for refusal and how actively you've been trying to find a job.

If you casually turn down a suitable job, you might face the maximum 12 week disqualification.

If a job is suitable but some factors make it less convenient for you, such as health issues, commuting costs, or impacting time with your family, a reduction in the disqualification period might be considered. If a refused job is short-term (7 weeks or less), there would be a minimum 7-week disqualification.

If a job you refuse is longer than 7 weeks, the disqualification period should not be more than the length of the job you turned down, up to a maximum of 12 weeks.

All  circumstances of each case must be examined in detail, to determine if  extenuating circumstances exist, and if so, to what extent they should reduce  the period of disqualification.\nIf 1 or more of the criteria for determining suitability were present, but were not significant enough to render the employment unsuitable, a reduction in the  period of disqualification would be in order. For example: the claimant's  health was an issue, but it was not so significant that it did not allow the  claimant to commute to the place of work, and to perform the work (Digest 9.3.1.1); there were  daily expenses involving commuting to work and child care arrangements, but  they were not so high that they would have put the claimant in a less  favourable financial situation (Digest 9.3.3) by accepting  the employment; the daily commuting time to and from the place of employment  was within reason, but the total hours of the work day would have meant less  than usual time with a claimant's young family in the evening. In addition, if  the duration of the employment is 7 weeks or less, the minimum 7 week  disqualification is appropriate (EI Act 28(1)(a)). Short term work is preferable to  no work at all, so a refusal of even 1 day of suitable employment could  result in the minimum 7-week disqualification.\nIf the duration of the employment refused is longer than 7 weeks, the length of the disqualification should not exceed the number of weeks that the  employment would have lasted, had the employment been accepted, and will never  exceed 12 weeks (EI Act 28(1)(a)). \nThe suitability of hours of work for prospective employment is not linked to the hours the claimant worked prior to the start of their claim. With few  exceptions, claimants are obligated to seek and accept all hours of work,  including part-time and full-time work (Digest 9.3.1.2). Consequently,  the length of a disqualification is not affected by the fact that the  employment opportunity may be less than full-time.

630,630,630,"The main goal of the Employment Insurance (EI) program is to help workers who lose their jobs by providing them with temporary financial assistance. Just paying into the program is not enough to get benefits. People who apply for benefits must show that they meet three main criteria regarding their ability to work. These include being capable of and available for work, unable to find a suitable job, and actively looking for work.

To make sure people are genuinely looking for work, in 1971, a rule was added that requires claimants to actively search for suitable employment. Claimants must prove that they are making reasonable efforts to find a suitable job. Suitable employment is work that aligns with a person's health, commuting abilities, family obligations, religious beliefs, and moral values. 

Claimants should continuously look for suitable jobs and are expected to engage in job search activities like assessing job openings, making resumes, registering with job search tools, attending job-related events, networking, contacting employers, applying for jobs, going to interviews, and undergoing skill assessments.

When deciding if a job is suitable for a claimant, factors such as the person's previous work, wages, working hours, terms of employment, commuting time, and overall job market information are considered.

Simply having paid into the plan is not sufficient in order to be entitled to  benefits (CUB  70549). A claimant must prove there are no circumstances or conditions that  exist that have the effect of disentitling or disqualifying the claimant from  receiving benefits (EI Act 49(1)(b)). There are 3 basic  requirements in the legislation, which must be met in relation to a claimant's  availability for work (CUB 75971).\nThe  legislation states that a claimant is not entitled to be paid benefits for any  working day in a benefit period, for which the claimant fails to prove that on  that day, the claimant was:\n\ncapable of and available for work\nunable to obtain suitable employment (EI Act 18(1)(a))\n\nIn order to reinforce these 2 requirements, the  necessity to personally seek employment was explicitly added in 1971, so that  waiting passively for an offer of work is generally considered insufficient to  prove availability (CUB 72119 and CUB 75031). Consequently the Commission may  require the claimant to prove: \n\nthey are making reasonable and customary efforts to obtain suitable employment       (EI Act 50(8))\n\nThese requirements are directly linked to the meaning of suitable  employment. Claimants are not required to be available for and seeking  employment that is not considered suitable pursuant to section  6(4) of the EIA and EIR 9.002.\nThe legislation includes the following specific criteria that are used to determine  whether an employment opportunity is suitable for a particular claimant (EIR 9.002):\n\nthe claimant's health and physical capabilities allow them to commute to the place of work and to perform the work\nthe hours of work are not incompatible with the claimant's family obligations or religious convictions\nthe nature of the work is not contrary to the claimant's moral convictions or religious beliefs\n\nThese criteria will apply for the duration of a claimant's benefit period, regardless  of the length of time the claimant is unemployed or the number of weeks of regular benefits the claimant receives. Other factors that are taken into  consideration when determining what constitutes suitable employment for a  claimant are, the claimant's previous occupation(s), wages, working hours and  conditions, the terms of employment, commuting times, and labour market  information.\nClaimants are expected to make sustained job search efforts that are directed towards obtaining suitable employment. The legislation sets out specific criteria to be considered when determining whether the efforts the claimant is making to  obtain suitable employment, are reasonable and customary. Those criteria include  9 activities that can be conducted to assist in obtaining suitable  employment (EIR 9.001(b)):\n\nassessing employment opportunities\npreparing a resume or cover letter\nregistering for job search tools or with electronic job banks or employment agencies\nattending job search workshops or job fairs\nnetworking\ncontacting prospective employers\nsubmitting job applications\nattending interviews\nundergoing evaluations of competencies",0.979218

Being  capable of working refers to the physical strength and/or experience required to perform the duties of employment in an occupation that is considered to be  suitable under the legislation (EI Act 18(1)(a); CUB 70880, CUB 77047A).\nWhile  being available may imply that an individual sincerely wants to work, a  willingness to work is not synonymous with being available for work. Availability for work is primarily a subjective matter which must be considered in light of a claimant's intentions. This can be done by examining statements,  actions and restrictions, as well as the concern shown by an individual towards  finding employment (CUB 55457B, CUB 72881). However, it must also be viewed objectively by  examining a person's prospects of employment in relation to any restricting circumstances,  whether created deliberately or not (CUB 63214).

This includes situations  where the claimant fails to prove they are making reasonable and customary  efforts to obtain suitable employment (EI Act 18(1)). Such a disentitlement can be imposed concurrently with  another disentitlement for a separate reason, and can also be imposed at the  same time as a disqualification.\nA  disentitlement for non-availability, like any other disentitlement, starts and ends on 1 of the 5 working days between Monday and Friday. Any Statutory Holiday falling between Monday and Friday is still considered to be a working  day.

If the claimant is no longer available for work as of a  Saturday or a Sunday, then the indefinite disentitlement is imposed as of the  following Monday. For example, if a claimant leaves his home area for the  purpose of a vacation on Saturday, May 25, 2019 the indefinite disentitlement  would be imposed as of Monday, May 27, 2019.\nAn  indefinite disentitlement can terminate only on the working day before the day the condition of entitlement is met.

If a situation makes it seem like someone might not be available to work, but their actions show that they are trying to find a job, then they might still be considered available. However, if someone quits their job for a reason that seems personal and affects their ability to work, like childcare issues, they could lose their benefits until they can show they are ready to work again.

Another scenario is when someone leaves their job because of health reasons but claims they could do lighter work. In this case, it's important to figure out if they are actually able to work despite their health issue. If the kind of work they say they can do is similar to the job they left, it might raise doubts about their availability to work.

There are many situations that could make it seem like someone is not ready or willing to work, such as voluntarily leaving a job for a reason that doesn't align with being available to work, refusing an offer of a suitable job, or not making any effort to find work. In these cases, just saying you are available for work is not enough proof. The person must give more convincing evidence to show they are available, like explaining their availability when asked or actively looking for work.

Where a particular  situation may initially cast doubt on a claimant's availability,  this would not be the case where, despite the claimant's  situation,     their   actions or behaviour strongly  indicate their intent is to become  re-employed. A presumption of non-availability arises whenever the  claimant does not act as a reasonable person who is desirous of working would,  under similar circumstances. A claimant's availability is also questionable  when the reason given  for voluntarily  leaving a job appears more  of a personal  reason that affects the  employee's availability to work.\nAn  example  would be  an employee who, after numerous years of service with the same employer,  terminates employment because of difficulties concerning baby-sitting  arrangements, but a few weeks later alleges to be again available for work  after  making  new child care arrangements.   Although a claimant in this situation may not  be disqualified for voluntarily leaving  their employment, they would be subject to a disentitlement from benefits for  failing to prove availability for work, until new child care  arrangements were made.  Once the barrier to  being available no longer exists, benefits could become payable (FCA A-479-94; FCA A-736-95; CUB 71883).\nOn  the other hand, no such presumption arises when an employee leaves employment  by reason of poor health and contends to  still be capable  of less strenuous duties. In this case, the only issue is whether that person  may be considered capable of and available for work despite the partial  incapacity. A presumption of non-availability  or incapacity would arise if the  duties that person claims to be still capable of performing, were the  same or very similar to those  required in the employment left. In this case,   the reason given for leaving would appear incompatible with  the  leaving itself.\nNumerous  actions can lead to a presumption of non-availability. They may include:  voluntarily leaving employment for a reason incompatible with the concept of  being available; requesting to be laid off in lieu of another employee or  failing to make use of bumping rights (CUB 79725); requesting a leave of absence (CUB 72299) or failing to return to work upon expiry of such leave, for  any number of reasons ; moving to an area where there are no  employment opportunities, even though there was no necessity for doing so;  voluntarily retiring from employment even though there was no necessity or  desire to do so   (CUB 77508, CUB 78523). \nAdditional  examples are: neglecting to avail oneself of an employment opportunity which  would offer valuable benefits, or refusing an offer of suitable employment (FCA A-1692-92; CUB 40393),  particularly after several months of unemployment; acting in such a way as to  deliberately get  dismissed; losing employment by reason of numerous absences due to poor health;  being in receipt of an allowance or benefit from  the employer which one would lose if employment was accepted at other premises;  giving outward signs of a person whose physical condition is greatly impaired;  making no personal efforts to find work; going away from one's place of  residence for a reason other than looking for work; attending a full-time  course of training or instruction not referred  by the Commission or delegated authority (FCA A-566-04; CUB  69536, CUB 72250, CUB 79278, CUB 80001); or not going to work while there is a labour dispute.\nA  mere statement that the claimant is available for work falls short of the proof  required and is never acceptable as evidence of availability where a  presumption of non-availability has arisen (CUB 75171). That presumption can of course be rebutted by more  convincing evidence. It is up to the claimant to provide plausible explanations  to that end such as providing specific details to clarify availability when  requested to do so, or demonstrate a sincere desire to work by  conducting an ongoing job search (FCA A-512-07, CUB 67165; CUB 78220, CUB 71781).",0.994181

Actions often speak  louder than words, and initial verbal statements  should  certainly be given more weight (FCA A-500-01; CUB 67726).\nIn  fact, a person who is not really looking for work will not always say so.  Unwillingness to work is sometimes disguised by undue restrictions which make  it very difficult to find work and is characterized by a passive attitude  toward one's responsibility in looking for work. The circumstances surrounding  a voluntary separation from employment and a failure of claimants to   make themselves   available   for  new  job opportunities  are  other indications of non-availability, where the reasons given may appear   to be an   excuse for not wanting to work.\nThis  type of situation becomes a question of credibility and must be decided on the  balance of probabilities. Where the claimant's actions are not  consistent  with  being available   and the statements made lack credibility, a disentitlement may be imposed. As  previously mentioned,  under the legislation, the onus of proving availability lies with the claimant (CUB 76016, CUB 77869). Proof beyond any reasonable doubt is not required, but  rather the evidence must lead the adjudicator to believe that the claimant is  available rather than tend to indicate the contrary.\nIt  is erroneous to believe a disentitlement to benefits may not be imposed until  the claimant has turned down a suitable job offer. On the other hand, the  absence of a job refusal or good cause for not accepting an offer of suitable  employment,  would not result in a  denial of benefits.  The claimant must show  that they  are sincerely  attempting  to put an end to the period of unemployment as quickly as  possible, and that the labour market situation is unfavourable, despite one's  willingness to work, ability and skills. The best evidence that can be provided  to this end   is a detailed account of one's personal efforts  made in all areas of the labour market in which there is a reasonable hope of  obtaining suitable employment (FCA A-598-03, CUB  58986). There are no legislative provisions which govern the  number of applications that must be made, or the format to be used  for a claimant's record of job searches. The legislation only requires that a  claimant be able to prove they are making  reasonable and customary efforts to obtain suitable employment (EIA 50(8); CUB 73580, CUB 79043). Availability must be examined objectively in light of  the claimant's intentions, as shown by their efforts, and in light of the  possibilities of employment in the kind of work sought and the region where  they reside or are seeking work (CUB 76310, CUB 76450).",0.94774604
645,645,645,"Canadian labor market information is easily available online and through other sources.

If the information about job opportunities is not enough and the person looking for a job has very specific requests, they should be told to consider all job offers that are suitable according to the law, even if the pay or type of job is not as good. If a person has been given enough time to find a job but is still being picky about the offers they accept, they might lose their benefits for not being available for work.

If someone is being picky about the jobs they consider and this makes it seem like they are not really trying to find work quickly, they may not be considered available for work, even if there is not a lot of detailed job information. It is up to the person looking for work to show that they are ready and willing to work.

Where the required information has not been reviewed, it is difficult to know whether reasonable employment opportunities exist. As such, a disentitlement for non-availability would be difficult to support, particularly if the claimant's expectations do not appear unreasonable (CUB 51749). A simple assumption that employment opportunities are limited to some extent since the claimant has made specific demands, is not enough to support a finding that their expectations  are  unduly limited (CUB 52209).\nWhere  the labour market information regarding employment opportunities is inadequate  but the claimant's expectations appear very restrictive in nature, although  they might not be qualified as extreme restrictions, the claimant should be  advised that they must seek and accept employment that is consistent with the  legislative definition of suitable employment (CUB 54389). This would  include   the requirement to seek and accept less favourable earnings and occupations,  particularly if a reasonable period of  time had already been  granted to allow the claimant to restrict  their availability for  work  (CUB 70715). If the claimant disregards this advice and chooses to  neither seek nor accept such work,  assuming  there is such suitable employment available for the claimant in the labour  market, the claimant is subject to a disentitlement for non-availability (Digest 10.4.2,  Digest 10.4.3.1, Digest  10.5.1, Digest  10.6.1).\nFinally,  in cases where the demands appear to be unduly restrictive or cast doubt on  one's interest in seeking employment  or  their desire to find work as quickly as possible, a finding that  availability has not been proven may be proper, even in the absence of detailed  labour market information. It will be up to the claimant to remove those  limitations, and prove their availability and willingness to  work (CUB 68636, CUB 70133).\nThe  above principles also apply to a claimant whose restrictions arise out of a  real constraint, such as personal or family obligations or lack of  transportation, rather than mere personal  restrictions.  Should the restrictions  imposed be so serious as to make  employment  opportunities virtually non-existent, then it will be up to the individual,  to find a solution that  will make it possible to accept any suitable  employment opportunity  that  may arise.

A signed statement constitutes prima facie  evidence of its authenticity and accuracy, and even an unsigned statement must  be given greater weight than a mere subsequent denial. It is not enough to  contend that the initial statement did not reflect what one really had in mind  or that one did not understand its contents (CUB 71390, CUB 77238).\nThe subsequent statement is even less convincing where the initial statement is simple and straightforward or unambiguous; where there are indications that it  was objectively taken; where it agrees with other facts reported or with  information obtained from another source; or where the claimant had ample  opportunity to clarify anything in it that was allegedly incorrect (CUB 65343). Unless there are extraordinary  circumstances, such as the initial statement being implausible or indications  that it was obtained under duress, the first statement retains full value in  spite of subsequent denials by the claimant.\nBased on these principles, any subsequent statement which clearly contradicts a prior statement or is intended to minimize the weight to be given to that prior  statement is suspect.

This is simply a common sense rule  and not an absolute principle. It may be departed from as often as  circumstances warrant, for example by reason of the claimant's age, education,  cultural background or state of health.\nIn  cases where contradictions are combined with language difficulties, a hearing impairment, or misunderstanding, it becomes even more difficult to determine which  statements represent the claimant's actual state of mind (CUB 66501). It is up to the claimant to  make any subsequent explanation plausible and credible so that prior statements  could logically be set aside.

This includes being willing to work with the transportation you have, not asking for more than what's fair in terms of the job type, pay, hours, and conditions.
The work area is not just your town but also nearby places where people usually travel for work.
It's important to note that availability for work should not depend on how good the job market is in your area. Instead, it's about your willingness to work, actively searching for jobs, and any limitations that make it hard for you to find work.
People shouldn't be denied benefits just because they live in an area with high unemployment. In fact, the law actually allows for longer benefits in these cases, not shorter ones.
Remember, the definition of work area is used to check if someone can work, not to decide if they refused a job offer.

Standard availability at any time during the benefit period is described in  the following paragraphs, in light of relevant jurisprudence.\nAvailability  is the willingness to accept immediately, any employment opportunity, anywhere  in one's work area, by using any available means of transportation, without  demanding anything more than what is suitable under the legislation in terms of  type of work, wages or salary, hours of work and other working conditions.\nThe  work area refers to the geographical region in which the claimant is normally  gainfully employed. It is not limited to the claimant's municipality but is  comprised of all surrounding communities to which local residents would usually  commute.\nIt  should be pointed out that this definition does not take into account local  economic conditions or the extent to which the work area is industrialized.  These are factors which should not be used in assessing availability for work.  Rather, availability should be determined on the basis of one's willingness to  work, personal efforts to find work and any restriction which reduces chances  of finding employment (FCA A-57-96; CUB 65548, CUB 76168A, CUB 79303).\nEntitlement  to benefits should not be denied simply because a claimant's normal place of  residence and work is in a region of higher unemployment. Such a position would  imply that people should leave rural or isolated areas. Much to the contrary,  the current legislation provides for a longer period of benefits in cases of  claimants residing in an area of high unemployment, not a shorter period (EIA 7; EIA 12; Schedule  I; EIR 17).\nFinally,  it must be kept in mind that the above definition of work area is valid in  assessing a claimant's availability for work. It is not necessarily applicable  when considering a refusal of a job offer. It is possible that a  disqualification may be imposed for refusing an otherwise suitable job offer outside  one's work area, but a disentitlement for non-availability would not be imposed  based solely on this reason.",0.9544531
652,652,652,"To get unemployment benefits, a person needs to show that they are ready to work every day and can accept a job offer quickly. Some people can start work right away, while others might need more time to get ready. If it takes a long time before someone can start a job, it might make it seem like they're not actually available to work. 

If someone wants to work, they should be prepared to start a new job the same day they get an offer, or by the next day at the latest. Some jobs require being on call or available at short notice. If someone can't start a job right away, they might not be considered available for work.

During the time they are looking for a job, it's okay for someone to have some days where they do personal things, visit family, or handle other responsibilities. But these things should not happen too often or regularly. If they do, it might affect their ability to find a job. 

A person should be able to return home quickly if they get a job offer while they're away, like within a day or two. They need to show that they are actively looking for work and are ready to start a job as soon as possible. If they don't show that they are trying to find work, it might raise questions about their ability to get a job. 

Having a break, taking a vacation, or being on leave from work cannot be seen as being available for work, unless the person can interrupt their break within a day or two to start a new job. 

The overall idea is that a person must be ready and able to work, even if they have personal things going on. There are specific rules for different situations like family obligations, vacations, sickness, or being outside the country.

Furthermore, an  unemployed person must be in a position to accept any opportunity for suitable  employment immediately, or within a very short time. This demonstrates the ongoing  concern any unemployed person must have to end a period of unemployment as soon  as possible (FCA  A-683-01, CUB  52330A).\nSome  individuals can be available to report for work within a few hours, whereas  others may require more time to free themselves from ongoing or occasional  constraints or obligations.\nIf a  lengthy period of time is required before a claimant can accept an offer of  suitable employment, this may cast doubt on the claimant's actual availability.  The issue then is what period of delay is acceptable before availability becomes  questionable. Under the act, a claimant must be available on a day-to-day  basis. This implies that persons who sincerely want to work should make  arrangements so that if any opportunity for suitable employment arises, they  are able, without delay, to report for work that same day, or at the latest,  the following day (CUB  74558).\nHowever,  some employments will require the individual to be on call or available with  very little notice. In such cases, a claimant who cannot resolve the problems  which prevent the immediate acceptance of any opportunity for suitable  employment on the same day or, at the latest the following day cannot be  considered available for work.\nThere  is no question that, during a period of availability, there may be occasional  isolated working days when a claimant devotes time to personal activities,  leaves the immediate area to visit family or friends, or fulfills civic, legal,  moral, religious or family obligations. On such occasions it must be ensured  that the claimant has remained available and could have reported for work, at  the latest, the day following an offer of employment.\nObviously,  a working day devoted to personal activities cannot be considered isolated if  it happens frequently or at regular intervals. If it does, then it restricts  the claimant's overall availability. The question then becomes to what extent  this restriction affects the claimant's opportunities for employment,  considering the occupation and terms of employment. These situations will be discussed  in more detail in the next section. Generally, a claimant's availability will  not be doubted if they are absent from their area for a short period (a week or  less), and have otherwise proven their availability,  and provided they have made the necessary  arrangements to be reached without delay. The claimant must also be able to  return within 24 to 48 hours if informed of an opportunity for employment.\nFor  example, a claimant could be occupied on an isolated occasion during a period  of availability, for several consecutive working days, as a result of  obligations, constraints or merely out of personal choice.\nThe  question then is whether the claimant, given the circumstances, is acting as a  person who is anxious to accept every opportunity for suitable employment, as  soon as possible. A mere statement of availability may not be sufficient. The  claimant must have made specific arrangements to be reached and informed  without delay, if an opportunity for suitable employment should arise. They  must be willing and able to return from their absence or to free themselves  from obligations, and report for work within 24 hours or at the most, 48 hours.\nThe  arrangements must be specific and credible, and must demonstrate that the  claimant can respond quickly to every opportunity for suitable employment. In  such a situation, if a claimant states they have not made or have been  prevented from making personal attempts to find work, this would raise doubts  as to the claimant's availability. The agent must determine if the length of  time the claimant indicates this situation would continue seems reasonable and still  supports their desire to find and obtain employment. Benefits may be allowed  for a short period of time in such situations. On the other hand, the  availability of a claimant who is not in a position to actively seek work for a  longer period will be in doubt.\nThis  approach regarding immediate availability assumes that the claimant remains  available for work despite the situation. It does not apply to an individual  who, for example, takes a period of rest (CUB 76457, CUB 79725), a vacation or an unpaid leave from  an employer (CUB 72391), but who claims that such a period  of rest or leave could be interrupted at any time within 24, or at the most 48  hours, if an opportunity for suitable employment arose. Such a situation cannot  be interpreted as being synonymous with availability.\nIt  must be emphasized that this general approach applies in many situations, some  of which are the subject of specific sections in this chapter:\n\nDigest  10.7.0 Hours of work; family obligations and religious beliefs\nDigest  10.11.1 Visiting family or friends\nDigest  10.11.2 On vacation\nDigest  10.11.4 Sickness or death in family\nDigest  10.11.5 Staying at the cottage\nDigest  10.14.5. Jury duty or court orders\nDigest 10.11.8 Out of Canada\n\nFinally,  an individual who has actually missed an opportunity for suitable employment because they were unable to respond to an employer within the time required by  the employer must demonstrate that there was a valid reason. Such a case will  be evaluated based on the principles in chapter  9 of this Digest.",0.99476177

The claimant's statements at the  time of their application for benefits, and throughout their bi-weekly  reporting regarding their availability can be accepted for the duration of  their benefit period. However, where the Commission becomes aware that a claimant's  availability is restricted in some way, the claimant must be advised of what is  expected of them in terms of their job search efforts and the types of work  they should be seeking.

It is the extent of the limitations that must be determined, such as the  claimant's restricted availability should be compared to the standard availability  for that type of employment, in order to assess the degree to which the chances  of finding employment are jeopardized.

The length of this period depends on how long you've been trying to find work and how likely it is for you to get a job. You don't have to figure out this time frame on your own. The goal is to let you know how long you have to search for a job while considering your limitations.

Although it's not required by the rules, the government will try to tell you how long you have to look for a job that matches what you can do. When this time is up, you might have a short period to adjust your job search if needed.

This period can  then be increased or shortened depending on additional factors, including the  claimant's behaviour, which will be discussed under some of the following  headings.\nThe  reasonable period begins with the start of the benefit period or date an  existing claim is renewed (reactivated). Any week within the benefit period, during  which the claimant is incapable of work or not available for work for any  reason, is counted as part of the reasonable period of time allowed. That is,  where a period of 12 weeks has been granted to look for work within a  claimant's restrictions, if the claimant is not capable of working at week 6 and  7, the 12-week period is not extended by 2 weeks.\nWhere  a claimant's availability is restricted, the reasonable period of time will be  based largely on how much time has elapsed since the start of their claim and  the possibilities of the claimant obtaining employment. Given the various  factors and considerations at issue, a claimant is not expected to determine what  their own reasonable period of time ought to be or what effect this reasonable  period of time has on their entitlement to benefits.\nAlthough  the granting of a reasonable period of time is not mandatory under the act, the Commission will try, whenever possible, to inform the claimant whose  availability is restricted in some way, of the reasonable period of time  allowed to explore the labour market within their expectations and capabilities.  This will allow the claimant to make adjustments to their restrictions, to  prove availability. This would be even more appropriate in the case where the  claimant, by continuing to receive benefits, is led to believe that their  search for employment or the conditions placed on the acceptance of employment  are acceptable (CUB  70740; FCA  A-134-95).\nThe  objective is to clearly inform claimants of their expectations and, if applicable, the reasonable period of time during which they can limit their availability  to employment within their restrictions.\nIt  may happen that the reasonable period is about to terminate, or has already terminated when the claimant is so informed by the Commission; the claimant may  then be provided with a short period to comply with their obligation regarding  their job search. Two weeks could be allowed to enable them to correct the  situation of availability which is at issue. This period would only be given if  there is an indication that the claimant intends to broaden their availability  and to modify the conditions initially set.\nThe  pertinent labour market information, as well as the information provided to the  claimant as to the reasonable period of time with respect to their situation,  should be clearly documented in the claimant's file. Finally, it is not a  matter of automatically accepting subsequent actions or statements by the  claimant after being informed of their responsibilities. The agent should  follow up with the claimant at a later date to ensure they fully understand and  are complying with their obligations for job search and availability. Such  actions or statements are subject to the usual rules of assessing credibility (Digest 10.3.0  to Digest 10.3.3).\nThe  intent of providing a warning is to ensure fairness in the adjudication of EI claims, for claimants who are and continue to be capable of and available for  work. It does not apply to claimants who have no intention, possibility or  capability of accepting employment, or to claimants who have set conditions on  accepting employment that are so restrictive that they cannot reasonably expect  to find work within those restrictions. These claimants cannot be considered  available for work.\nFinally,  the fact that a person who is not available for work for one reason or another, has not been warned to expand their job search cannot entitle this person to benefits  or require the Commission to revisit its decision disentitling the claimant  because of unavailability (FCA  A-134-95, CUB 26680).",0.801358
658,658,658,"Restrictions can be grouped into two categories depending on whether they are chosen by the person or forced upon them. If the restriction is chosen by the person, it's called a voluntary restriction. If the restriction is forced upon the person and they have little control over it, it's called an involuntary restriction. When assessing a person's ability to work, both types of restrictions need to be considered.

Whether a restriction is voluntary or involuntary, they both make it harder to find a job. But voluntary restrictions are different from involuntary restrictions. Voluntary restrictions might make it seem like the person isn't very interested in finding a job, while involuntary restrictions exist regardless of the person's desire to work. This difference suggests that more time might be needed to find a job if someone is dealing with an involuntary restriction.",57.54562500000003,9.611409574468087,13.81666964889586,14.99326241134752,11.46696808510638,12.587801418439716,44.57535460992908,4.75,0.8545965296881539,0.8413596451282501,2.481753351041178,0.4792298084653993,0.4586895317073124,0.0599990050400112,5.113475177304965,4.0,3.215856544252809,17.625,18.0,5.360445410597892,1.553191489361702,1.0,0.8866666553209642,141,73,0.5177304964539007,745,8,10.4.3,Restrictions,Chapter 10 - Availability,"Restrictions  fall into 2 categories depending on whether they are voluntary or  involuntary.

However, looked at in another  way, voluntary restrictions are clearly different from involuntary restrictions.  Voluntary restrictions generally cast doubt on the claimant's eagerness to find  work, while involuntary restrictions may exist regardless of the claimant's desire  or need to obtain employment.

Restrictions that come from personal choices usually have to do with what kind of work someone wants, how much money they want to make, how many hours they want to work, how far they're willing to travel for work, and what type of industry they want to work in.

Once you're asked to look outside the hiring hall, staying registered there counts as looking for a job. But you still need to actively look for jobs outside the hiring hall too. If you only want certain types of jobs, you might not get your benefits until you agree to look for more kinds of jobs. If there are good job opportunities within your limits, you won't lose your benefits right away when you restrict the types of jobs you're looking for. But you will be given some time to expand your job search before you lose your benefits. Each case is different, so it will be looked at one by one.",82.82676204819278,6.8615361445783165,7.492282038375204,9.424497991967872,8.049819277108433,6.624096385542167,31.99497991967872,2.333333333333333,0.9016613364219666,0.8857972145080566,2.718187036630775,0.6402809279978553,0.4444886392595104,0.0580235582331247,4.056224899598393,4.0,1.8467521163218,20.75,18.0,9.592748997723923,1.216867469879518,1.0,0.5313057213924592,249,112,0.4497991967871486,1054,12,10.6.4,Union hiring halls,Chapter 10 - Availability,"Pursuing employment through a union hiring hall may be evidence that a claimant is  available for work.

Usually, all hours of work are considered suitable, unless there are very specific circumstances mentioned in the law. In order to show that they are available to work, people need to be ready to look for and accept any hours of work that are available in the job market. 

Before deciding that a person can't work because of their situation, it's important to check if they can control that situation. To prove they are available to work, people are expected to try their best to figure out ways to deal with things that might stop them from working, like family duties or personal responsibilities, so they can search for and accept work hours available in the job market. Unless a person can't work certain hours because of their religious beliefs, they need to be open to working at all other times. Sometimes, people can talk to their employers and adjust their work hours to fit in with their family duties, personal responsibilities, or religious beliefs.

Is the claimant  avoiding otherwise suitable employment because of an unwillingness to work  certain hours? If so, a disentitlement may be in order.\nFor  example, a claimant seeking work as an accountant or high school teacher would  not be considered to be limiting their chances of obtaining suitable employment  if they are unwilling to work evenings, where there are limited opportunities  for such work in the evenings.\nA  claimant who is seeking work as a nurse as well as work in similar occupations,  but is unwilling to work at night for personal reasons, could be considered to  be limiting their chances of obtaining suitable employment by imposing such a  restriction. A disentitlement for non-availability could be in order, in this  scenario. However, if such a claimant has family obligations that are in fact  incompatible with working at night, and the claimant is unable to make arrangements  regarding those obligations, then nightshift work would not be suitable, and  the claimant would not be obligated to seek or accept such work. The onus of  proving availability is on the claimant. Therefore, in order to be considered available  for work the claimant would need to establish that they are available for work  in the labour market under conditions that afford reasonable opportunities for  re-employment. As such the claimant would need to be available for work as a  nurse as well as in other occupations outside of nightshift work.\nA  claimant who was previously employed as a teacher and who is seeking work as a  teacher, as well as any other occupation in which they are qualified to work,  would be considered unavailable for suitable employment if they are unwilling  to work mornings. A disentitlement for non-availability could be in order for  imposing such a restriction. However, if this claimant can prove that they have  family obligations that are in fact incompatible with working mornings, and  they are unable to change those obligations, then opportunities for work that  include hours in the morning would not be suitable, and the claimant would not  be obligated to either seek or accept such work. In order to be considered  available for work, the claimant would need to establish that they are  available for work in the labour market under conditions where reasonable  opportunities for re-employment exist. As such the claimant could be available  for work as a teacher, but would also need to be available in other occupations  during other hours.\nEach  of these cases must be examined on its own merits. What must be considered is  whether the claimant is placing a restriction on their availability, or if they  simply prefer certain hours, and the extent to which the claimant's family  responsibilities are in fact incompatible with certain hours of work. Labour  market information should be considered in these cases, particularly if the  evidence is unclear as to the availability of suitable employment during  certain hours. This will assist in deciding if the claimant is avoiding  suitable employment by restricting their hours of work, or if the conditions  under which the claimant is willing to work afford reasonable opportunities for  re-employment. As well, the extent of any restrictions and whether there exist  opportunities for work within those restrictions, will determine whether a  reasonable period of time should be granted to allow the claimant to find work  within those restrictions.",0.8996812

The basic availability requirements of the legislation require  that the claimant be available for work on every working day from Monday to  Friday (EIA 18(1)( a); EIR 32). Consequently, this claimant may be  disentitled for non-availability for those days (EIA 20). However, should the condition no longer  be temporary and continue beyond that short period, an indefinite  disentitlement would apply until they are able to free themselves of those  family obligations and are able to accept work. As previously stated, each case  must be examined on its own merits.\nIn addition, the claimant may also be subject to a 7 to 12 week disqualification if they fail to apply for, accept, or take  advantage of an otherwise suitable employment opportunity that includes working  on a Thursday or Friday (EIA 27(1)(a) and (b); Digest 9.1.0).\nA claimant who has been in receipt of sickness benefits and who is then capable of working, but for less than 5 days per week would not be able to establish entitlement to regular benefits for all 5 working days in that week. For example, a claimant who has received less than the maximum weeks of sickness benefits may recover to the extent that they can now work, but for only 3 days a week. If the claimant has met the conditions of entitlement to sickness benefits for the other 2 days of the week, they would not be entitled to regular benefits but would be entitled to their remaining weeks of sickness benefits, up to the  maximum weeks of entitlement in their benefit period  (Digest 11).\nA claimant who has already received the maximum weeks of sickness benefits but has recovered to the extent that they can now  work, but for only 3 days per week, could receive regular benefits but would be  subject to a disentitlement for the 2 days they are incapable of working each  week.\nBefore considering a disentitlement for only  part of a week the underlying condition as to why the claimant is unable to  seek and accept suitable employment for the entire week must be closely  examined. A disentitlement for only part of the week would be appropriate only  when the underlying condition is due to incapacity, or when the condition is  only temporary, for 1 or 2 weeks, and the claimant has proven availability for  work for the other working days of the week. In many situations the underlying  condition that led to the claimant avoiding suitable employment is continuing,  in which case an indefinite disentitlement would be appropriate. As mentioned  above a claimant who does not have child care arrangements in place for 2 of  the 5 working days each week is subject to an indefinite disentitlement as this  is a self-imposed restriction which affects their overall availability for work  and likelihood of finding suitable employment.\nClaimants attending non-referred courses of  instruction may also claim they are available for work on days they do not  attend classes. The underlying condition that led to the non-availability, in  other words, the claimant's attendance at a course of instruction, continues  even though the claimant may not be attending classes on a particular day; in  fact, it continues until the course is either completed or abandoned. These  situations must first be examined in light of the principles in section 10.12.0 of this Digest. Claimants attending a non-referred course  must rebut a strong presumption of non-availability during the period of the  course. Attendance at classes is only one of many factors that must be  examined. If the claimant has not completed or left the course the  disentitlement for non-availability will be for the entire week even though the  claimant may not be required to attend classes on one or more days each week.  In addition, claimants who refuse to apply for, accept, or take advantage of a  suitable employment opportunity because of attendance at a non-referred course  of instruction may be subject to a seven to twelve week disqualification (Digest 9.6.0).",0.99853563

680,680,680,"The general rule is that working part-time while still getting benefits should not stop you from being available for full-time work. Having a part-time job shows that you are available and ready to work. However, there are three different situations to consider:
1. If you think part-time work is enough and you don't want to work more hours, you might not be considered fully available for work.
2. If you are willing to leave your part-time job for a full-time one, then you are considered generally available for work. But you might need to prove you are actively looking for a full-time job.
3. If you are already working part-time and only want another part-time job to make a full work week, then you might not be seen as fully available for work.
In these cases, you could lose benefits for the whole week, be asked to prove you are job searching, or lose benefits if you turn down full-time work.

The  fact that a claimant is working part time does not necessarily mean they are  imposing an undue restriction on their availability. Rather, the acceptance of  an offer of part time work usually indicates the person is in fact available  for work, at least to the extent required by the part-time job. Nevertheless,  the 3 following situations should be distinguished:\n\nthe claimant considers part-time employment sufficient and would be unwilling to work more hours or days per week\nthe claimant is prepared to leave the current part-time job to accept a full-time position\nthe claimant is limiting availability to a second part-time job which, with the current one, would amount to a full work week\n\nIn  the first case, the claimant is considered to be employed to the fullest extent  of their availability and is avoiding other suitable employment, therefore, a  disentitlement would apply for the entire week (CUB 73957, CUB 78294).\nIn  the second case the claimant's willingness to abandon their part time  employment in favour of full time work, establishes the claimant's availability  for work in general. However, the claimant could be asked to provide proof that  they are making reasonable and customary efforts to obtain suitable full time  employment.\nIn  the third case the claimant cannot avoid otherwise suitable employment, because  it is full time. Assuming there is suitable full time employment in the labour  market for the claimant, a disentitlement for non-availability would be  appropriate if the claimant insists on such a restriction.\nHowever,  claimants who refuse to accept a full-time job may still be able to prove they  are available for work, if they have good reasons to believe their current job  will become full-time in the near future.

682,682,682,"When an employee has worked for a company for a long time, they naturally want to keep their rights and hope to be able to go back to their old job if they get laid off. It's normal for someone to see being called back to their old job as the best chance to find work quickly and to act accordingly. Telling a possible new employer about the chance of being called back to your old job, even if it means you might miss out on a new job, doesn't mean you're purposely stopping yourself from getting hired.

But, if there are other good job opportunities available from different employers, the person can't only focus on going back to their old job. This is because it wouldn't be fair to the companies who pay into a fund to help people who need work, either permanently or temporarily. In general, people who are looking for work need to be open to all types of jobs from various employers as long as the job is a good fit (EI Act 6(4); EIR 9.002(1)).

Sometimes, employees ask their employer to let them go instead of someone with less experience, or they might ask for more time before being called back to work. In these cases, it looks like the person might not really be ready to work.

It is reasonable for a person to consider the promised recall as the best  opportunity to obtain suitable employment in the short term, and to act  accordingly. Informing a potential employer of the possibility of recall to a  previous employer, at the risk of losing out on a job opportunity does not necessarily  mean that the claimant deliberately prevented a potential offer of employment.\nHowever, claimants cannot restrict their re-employment to only their former employer if there are other suitable permanent or temporary employment opportunities  available in the labour market. To do so would impact negatively on employers  who contribute to the fund and who require workers on either a permanent or  temporary basis. Generally then, claimants must be willing to seek and accept  all permanent and temporary work with other employers as long as the employment  is suitable (EI Act 6(4); EIR 9.002(1)).\nEmployees sometimes request that their employer lay them off instead of other employees with less seniority or, they may request that their recall date be delayed (CUB 66701, CUB 66926A). Such request is evidence that one  may not be available for work.

However, like all other  individuals claiming regular benefits, claimants who have been laid off from  work, even for a short period of time, and even with a promise of either a  recall with their former employer or employment with a new employer, must be  willing to seek and accept suitable employment elsewhere. There are several  criteria that are used to determine whether an employment opportunity is  suitable (EI Act 6(4); EIR 9.002(1)).\nAssuming employment that  meets those criteria is available, claimants who have an assurance of either  returning to work with their former employer or of starting work with a new  employer in the near future, must be willing to seek and accept suitable  temporary work in the meantime. In addition, such claimants must continue to be  willing to seek and accept suitable temporary or permanent work elsewhere until  they are scheduled to return to their former employer or start the new  employment.\nIn this regard what is required is not an absolute certainty, but a reasonable assurance that the recall or other employment will materialize as promised.  There must be an actual offer of re-employment or new employment, including  some type of assurance, which must come directly from the employer (FCA A-104-07, CUB 67542; FCA A-123-03). Any statement by the claimant to this effect may have to be supported by documentary evidence; the fact that one subsequently started the employment within the expected time is a strong indication that there was a promise of employment. This does not mean that claimants who have a definite job to go to shortly are exempted from proving  that they continue to be available for work.\nClaimants  who admit that they are not available for or seeking other work while awaiting  a recall or waiting to start other work cannot of course be said to be  available for work. The same is true of claimants who are not prepared to  consider job opportunities that may arise during the lay-off as they wish to remain  exclusively available to their former employer.\nIf the lay-off period is expected to be for an extended period of time, it is reasonable to assume that a claimant will have a better chance of obtaining  temporary employment if they are fully available for and willing to accept any  suitable employment. Thus, depending on the opportunities that exist in the  claimant's area and the expected duration of the lay-off, claimants in this  situation may be required to show that they continue to make efforts to find  temporary work. Availability is not proven when a claimant imposes so many restrictions that it becomes almost impossible to obtain a temporary job.\nAs with any situation where a claimant may be restricting their availability in any way, what must be considered is whether the claimant is placing an actual  restriction on their availability, or if they simply prefer temporary or  permanent work, as evidenced by their job search efforts. Labour market  information should be considered in these cases, particularly if the evidence  is unclear as to the availability of suitable employment under the conditions  the claimant has imposed upon themselves. This will assist in deciding if the claimant is avoiding suitable employment or if the conditions under which the claimant is willing to work afford reasonable opportunities for re-employment.",0.9861623

It is not fair for seasonal workers to be okay with only working a few months each year and being unemployed the rest of the time. They should be willing to work in different places or industries.

If there are other job options available besides their old seasonal job, claimants should be open to those opportunities, whether they are permanent or temporary. Only wanting to work for their old employer can hurt other employers who also need workers.

Seasonal workers should actively look for and accept any job offers that are suitable under the law. If a different job comes up that might interfere with their seasonal work, they should consider which job would reduce the amount of time they are unemployed each year.

688,688,688,"In big cities, most job opportunities are in the downtown area. If someone doesn't want to travel a reasonable amount of time to get to work, their chances of finding a job quickly might go down. If there's no good reason why they can't travel to downtown for work, it might seem like they're not really serious about finding a job.

But, there are also plenty of job opportunities in the suburbs. If someone only wants to work in a specific part of the city, it will be checked if this affects their chances of getting a job.

People who are looking for a job can limit their search in the beginning based on what they did before, including how much they used to earn and how far they had to travel, but this period is temporary. They may be given some time to find a job that fits these conditions. At the end of this period, if they can't find a suitable job, they may need to be open to more options or they might not get any more help.

Even if someone used to work in downtown but doesn't want to anymore, they can look for jobs elsewhere in the city for a while. But if there are no good job options in the area they prefer, they may not get extra time to find a job with their specific conditions.

If someone refuses to look for jobs outside their city area, it's seen as a restriction. But if they still have a chance of finding a job they want, they might be given some time. If they can't find a job after a long time and there are many job options, it might mean they are limiting themselves or not trying hard enough.

Therefore, chances of obtaining employment in the short term  may be largely reduced if a claimant is not prepared to accept a reasonable  travel time from home to the core of the city. Unless unavoidable circumstances  make it  impossible for a  claimant to commute to a potential work location, their   unwillingness to accept work  downtown may  raise doubt  as  to their  sincere desire  to obtain work.\nOn  the other hand, suburban areas may also offer many employment opportunities. In cases where claimants restrict their willingness to accept work to a specific  area of the city, a determination must be made regarding the extent to which  the likelihood of obtaining employment is reduced (CUB  46313, CUB  57048).\nA  reasonable period of time to find work may be allowed to claimants who are initially restricting their job search efforts or availability to the type of  work, wages and other conditions of their previous employment,  including commuting time. This will depend on the claimant's  occupation and whether they have   a reasonable chance of finding work within their restrictions. Whether  the claimant would be willing to remove their restrictions at  the end of a reasonable period of time would also be a factor in determining  whether a reasonable period of time  should be granted at all (CUB  75112). At the end of a reasonable period of time, if allowed, claimants will be required to lower their expectations or they could be disentitled from further benefits.\nEven  claimants whose recent employment was in the downtown area, and who no longer wish to accept work in that specific area may be allowed a reasonable period to  look for work in other parts of the city. A reasonable period of time to  exclude employment in the downtown core or to restrict their  job search efforts or availability to the type of work, wages and other  conditions of their previous employment will not be granted if  there are no suitable employment opportunities in the part of the city in which  the claimant is seeking work.\nAn  unwillingness to consider employment opportunities outside the greater area of the city or in the surrounding communities is a restriction. However, as long  as the claimant has a realistic chance of finding employment within their  restrictions a reasonable period of time will be allowed. The inability to find  work after a lengthy period of unemployment, in an occupation in which there  are many opportunities, may be an indication that the claimant has either  imposed restrictions which negate the chances of obtaining such work, or is not   making sufficient efforts to find work.\nClaimants  who reside in neighboring communities are expected to make themselves available for work in the city, and be prepared to commute daily according to  the normal methods of commuting within their  community.

If a person's health stops them from doing the type of job they used to do, and they donâ€™t want to try a different type of job, they can get sickness benefits. But if they are open to different types of jobs and there are jobs available, then they can get regular benefits. 

Even if a person is sick, they might still be able to do some easier tasks. However, if it's unlikely they can find suitable work during recovery, they won't be seen as able to work.

If someone has used up all their sickness benefits and then says they can work, they wonâ€™t get regular benefits unless their health has really gotten better. 

Someone can be unable to work a few days a week but still be seen as able to work other days. This should be considered on a daily basis, and they could still get sickness benefits if they meet other conditions. 

Lastly, there's a difference between someone with a permanent disability and someone who just became disabled. A person with a permanent disability who can work to their full ability won't be judged based on their disability when looking for work. But if they limit their availability for reasons not related to their disability, they might not get benefits.",75.92588859416448,7.65685823754789,10.727762888450028,11.555673445328615,8.603404067197175,7.687509578544063,37.31830238726791,3.4615384615384617,0.8293217023213705,0.8020738905126398,2.777144750746656,0.417636815601259,0.4195099895882356,0.0635655241591566,4.245210727969349,4.0,2.225166499784298,20.07692307692308,20.0,6.018708505236477,1.3065134099616855,1.0,0.6822290690770485,261,114,0.4367816091954023,1153,13,10.10.3,Application,Chapter 10 - Availability,"Claimants cannot be considered capable of work if they say they are physically unable to work, or if they are in fact unable to work. In this situation, the question to  decide is whether the claimant may be entitlement to sickness benefits  (CUB 70774, CUB 73094). This subject is covered in chapter 11 of this Digest.\nClaimants are considered physically unable to work when their inability is such that it rules out almost any possibility of obtaining employment in an occupation that  is considered to be otherwise suitable, pursuant to the legislation (EIR 40(4)). Every situation must be  examined based on the claimant's individual circumstances.\nIf the claimant's health and physical condition prevents the possibility of obtaining employment in the same type of occupation in which they worked in  their qualifying period, and the claimant is unwilling to accept other types of  work, the claimant would be considered unable to work, and the question to  consider would be whether or not they may be entitled to sickness benefits.  However, if a claimant in this situation is willing to accept other types of  work, assuming there are reasonable opportunities for such employment in the  labour market, the claimant would be considered available for and capable of  work, and would be entitled to regular benefits.\nA worker who is away from work temporarily due to illness or injury, may still be capable of performing less strenuous tasks. However, such a job attached  claimant would nevertheless be considered physically unable to work if there is  little or no chance of finding suitable work within their restrictions during  their recovery and until they resume their employment.\nClaimants who have received the maximum number of weeks that can be paid as sickness benefits, cannot subsequently claim regular benefits by saying that they are  now capable of and available for work, unless their physical condition has  clearly improved. It is not possible that one's physical condition can support  a finding of incapability as well as a finding of capability (FCA  A-179-13).\nIt is also possible for claimants to prove incapacity with respect to a limited number of working days in a week, and be capable of and available for work on  the other working days. Since incapacity as well as availability for work must  be given consideration on a day-to-day basis, this situation may be acceptable  (EIA 18). Incapacity for less than the 5 working  days in a particular week would not affect the claimant's ability to receive up to the maximum weeks of sickness benefits, if they meet all other entitlement conditions to receive sickness.\nA minor attached claimant (less than 600 hours of insurable employment in their qualifying period) may be able to establish a benefit period for regular  benefits. However, if the reason they have stopped working is due to illness,  they would not be entitled to sickness benefits for as long as they are  incapable of working for that reason (EIA 21(1); CUB 76344).\nA minor attached claimant who is not able to collect sickness benefits, but who is capable of working less than 5 days a week, may be entitled to regular  benefits.  The claimant would, however, be  subject to a disentitlement for each working day they are incapable of working.\nA distinction must be made between a worker with a permanent disability and one who has had to leave work as a result of a recent disability. Where a person  has worked in insurable employment while suffering from a permanent partial  disability, the person would be insured against the risk of unemployment in  that context.\nAt no point during the benefit period should such a disability be considered in assessing prospects of employment. Claimants in this situation are only  required to be available within the full extent of their capability. Their  reduced physical or other condition will be considered in assessing what  constitutes reasonable efforts on their part to find work. Restrictions imposed  on their availability, which do not arise out of their disability, may lead to  disentitlement.",0.9948088
698,698,698,"Pregnancy and giving birth do not automatically stop someone from receiving benefits. But, this rule doesn't apply if the person is claiming benefits specifically for being on maternity leave.

When it comes to pregnant individuals applying for benefits, there are usually three common situations: not working by choice because of the pregnancy, having a pregnancy with complications, and having a pregnancy without complications. If a pregnant person says they can't work, they won't be considered available for a job. If they quit their job because of the pregnancy, it suggests they may not be able to work or just don't want to work. The burden is on the person to prove they are still able to work and actively looking for a job.

For pregnancies with complications, the first thing to figure out is if the person can't work according to the rules and if they can get sickness benefits. If they can't get those benefits, it needs to be determined how much their condition affects their ability to work. If there are limited job options for them due to their condition and they don't show a willingness to work, they may not be able to prove they are ready and able to work.

Even if there are no complications during the pregnancy, a person might have temporary illnesses that prevent them from working normally for short periods. Instead of quitting, they could ask for lighter duties or time off until they can work again. Leaving a job without trying these options first could affect their ability to get benefits later.

If someone loses their job while pregnant but not because of their own choice, and they show they are willing to work temporarily until their baby is due, they can still be considered available for work. Just being pregnant doesn't automatically mean they can't work or get a job.

If someone asks for benefits after maternity or parental leave and doesn't go back to their old job, the reason for not going back will be checked. Failing to make an effort to return to work or arrange child care may show they are not ready or available to work. If they tried to arrange child care but couldn't due to unusual work hours, they may be considered available as long as they can find child care for regular hours.",68.88054355919583,9.424169769173496,10.718039707386858,12.332092330603128,11.519773641102011,9.55726582278481,44.247952345495165,4.882352941176471,0.876399289816618,0.8606555581092834,2.691396063425986,0.4527849530775668,0.4512619445658093,0.0575811293798949,4.529113924050633,4.0,2.485611856963393,23.23529411764705,23.0,7.182735934289253,1.3518987341772153,1.0,0.6789531703046626,395,158,0.4,1855,17,10.10.4,Pregnancy and childbirth,Chapter 10 - Availability,"Pregnancy  and childbirth do not by themselves disentitle a claimant from benefits. The following does not apply where a claim is established for maternity rather than  regular benefits.\nIn regard to claimants who are pregnant, the most common situations fall into 3 scenarios: voluntary unemployment as a result of the pregnancy;  pregnancies with complications; and pregnancies with no complications.  Naturally, a claimant does not demonstrate that she is available for work if  she states that she is unable to work or if she is actually unable to work  because of the pregnancy.\nLeaving employment voluntarily because of pregnancy strongly suggests that a claimant is unavailable, because her departure indicates that either her ability to work  is reduced, or she simply prefers not to work. The same is true of a claimant  who asks for a leave of absence rather than continuing to work, or neglects to  avail herself of an opportunity of suitable employment, during pregnancy. The  onus is on the claimant to disprove this presumption by showing that her  decision to leave her job or to refuse other work does not affect her ability  or willingness to work, and that she is still actively seeking work that she  could reasonably hope to obtain.\nIn cases of pregnancies with complications, the first question to determine is  whether the claimant is incapable of work within the meaning of that word, as  found in the legislation, and whether she is entitled to sickness benefits. If  not entitled, an assessment must be made of the extent to which her condition  reduces prospects of employment.\nUnless there are reasonable employment opportunities within her reduced capability and she demonstrates her willingness to work, the claimant will not likely be able  to prove that she is capable of and available for work.\nWhile there may be no complications, a claimant may suffer from temporary illnesses at the outset of a pregnancy, which could, for short periods, prevent her from  performing her usual duties. Reasonable alternatives to quitting employment in  such cases, would be to request modified duties or a leave of absence until she  is able to return to work. Voluntarily leaving employment without first  considering these alternatives could impact the claimant's entitlement to  regular benefits, should she request them.\nClaimants who lose their jobs while pregnant, but do not do so voluntarily, will be considered available for work, provided they can demonstrate that they are willing  to work, at least on a temporary basis until their expected due date. Pregnancy  alone, is not considered an obstacle to a claimant's availability or capability  of obtaining employment.\nWhere a claimant requests regular benefits following maternity and/or parental benefits, the reason she is not returning to her previous employment must be  reviewed. Failure to make the required effort to return to her usual job, or to  make the necessary child care arrangements so that she can actively seek work, is  evidence that the claimant may not be willing or available to return to the  labour force (CUB 47727). In situations where the claimant has attempted to make  child care arrangements but has been unable to do so due to the unusual hours of  employment offered, she may be considered available, provided she has made  adequate arrangements for normal working hours.",0.9928241

These situations include visiting family or friends, being on vacation, searching for work, dealing with sickness or a family death, staying at a vacation home, being in the hospital, being in jail, or being out of the country.

People who receive benefits are not required to ask permission from the program before leaving their home area, and being away from home does not automatically mean they cannot work.

This presumption is not limited to  claimants  who are taking courses on their own initiative, but applies to all  claimants whose file  raises doubts as to their availability  for work and sincere efforts to find employment (CUB 77999, CUB 79303).\nAlthough  taking a training course is a commendable activity in and of itself,  jurisprudence clearly states that students must still demonstrate  their availability for work for the duration of their studies, and that they  must produce convincing evidence to rebut the presumption of non-availability.  This can be done by showing that their intention is to immediately accept  suitable employment, as evidenced by job search efforts, that they are prepared  to make whatever arrangements may be required, or that they are prepared to  abandon the course to accept suitable employment (CUB 73932, CUB 74693).",0.99979097
721,721,721,"In figuring out how a course affects someone's ability to work, several things need to be thought about. The limitations due to the course should be compared to restrictions like the type of job or the hours worked. Part of this process includes analyzing if the person taking the course is more focused on finding a job or completing the course. It's important to look at their actions to see where their priorities lie, like if they are ready to accept a job offer immediately even if it means changing their course schedule or dropping out. 

Some questions that could help with this decision-making are: What does the person really want? What actions have they taken to show this? Have they been actively looking for a job? How much time and money are they putting into the course? Can they work while on the course? Have they secured a way to change their schedule or get a refund if they need to leave the course? Have they been looking for a job while studying? 

Sometimes, the person evaluating this situation might need more information like class schedules, homework load, exam timings, and even financial details related to the course. 

It's important not to focus on just one thing, such as if the person has worked and studied at the same time before, as this might not give the full picture. The decision-maker should look at all the details like the person's intentions if a good job shows up, how hard they've tried to find work, if they're studying for credit or interest, their readiness to leave the course for a job, the hours and length of the course, how flexible the course schedule is, the money spent, if any of it can be refunded, and if they're eligible for financial aid.

In reviewing the file, the  agent  should consider all circumstances and facts, such as the claimant's intentions  if a suitable job comes up, the efforts made to find employment, whether the  course is being taken for credit or simply out of interest, the claimant's  willingness to abandon the course in favour of employment, the number of hours  per week and the length of the course, the flexibility of the course schedule  to enable the claimant to accept work, the sums invested, whether a portion of  the course fees may be refunded, and the conditions of entitlement to a student  bursary or student loan, in addition to the pattern of employment and studies (FCA  A-556-04, CUB  61560A, CUB 76708).\nThe assessment of all the subjective and objective circumstances and facts and the conditions placed on accepting employment  will  enable the  agent to  determine the effect the training course has on the claimant's availability.

The  agent must  then determine if the skills and/or experience of the claimant will allow for  reasonable prospects of employment within these conditions.\nWhat must then be determined is whether the terms and conditions of the claimant's  availability are restrictive within the area's labour market. It is therefore  necessary to obtain and evaluate the labour market information to determine if  attendance at the course is detracting from the claimant's chances of obtaining  employment (CUB  53156, CUB 66265).\nFor example, the claimant resides in an area in which there is little or no  possibility of employment and has experienced many weeks of unsuccessful job  search and difficulty finding employment because of the variable conditions of  the labour market. Faced with poor labour market conditions, a claimant  (including seasonal employment workers and those living in remote regions),  while remaining available and  searching for  work, may  decide to take a course rather than remain inactive.\nWhen making a decision in such cases, the  agent  must take into account factors related to the labour market in terms of whether        employment opportunities   are limited; or whether  local labour market conditions  are good and the claimant should be able to  become re-employed.\nThe agent  has a  degree of flexibility when  assessing the claimant's availability in light of the local labour market.  However, in order to conclude  that a claimant's   availability in these cases is proven,  the course  should  be of secondary importance and  should  not  be an  obstacle to seeking and accepting suitable employment in the event  the labour market improves.  In this context,  once  the availability has been accepted in these situations,  the claimant's  ongoing availability  should be   examined periodically as  the labour market evolves (CUB 74921).",0.89159715

They need to show that they are making reasonable efforts to find a job that fits their skills and abilities. It's important for them to continue searching for work for as long as they are receiving benefits. Each person's effort will be considered individually, taking into account factors like job availability in the market.

There are certain criteria in place to determine if a job opportunity is suitable for a claimant.

They should also keep a record of their job search efforts. If a claimant doesn't make enough effort to find work, they may lose their benefits.

It's important for claimants to make consistent efforts to find suitable employment and to be willing to accept jobs that match their qualifications. Claimants should not restrict their job search and must be open to various job opportunities. If they face challenges like seasonal job availability, they still need to actively look for work. If claimants disregard their job search obligations, they may lose their benefits.

Claimants have always  been required to make efforts to obtain suitable employment; however, they are  not required to seek employment that is not suitable. Whether a particular  claimant is making reasonable and customary efforts to obtain suitable  employment, is an individual consideration that must take into account a number  of factors, including whether or not there are actual or potential vacancies  and opportunities in the labour market that are suitable for the claimant. If  there is a question as to whether or not there are suitable vacancies or  opportunities for a particular claimant, labour market information must be  obtained to clarify the issue.\nThe legislation includes specific criteria that are to be used in determining  whether an employment opportunity is suitable for a particular claimant.\nThe  legislation also lists specific criteria for determining whether the efforts  the claimant is making to obtain suitable employment constitute reasonable and  customary efforts. Those criteria include whether the claimant's efforts are:\n\nsustained\ndirected toward obtaining suitable  employment\nconsistent with suggested activities  that can be used to assist claimants in their efforts to obtain suitable  employment (EIR  9.001)\n\nThe  claimant's efforts must be sustained (EIR 9.001(a)). They must be  continuous and extend for the duration of time that the claimant is claiming  regular benefits, although there may be situations where claimants are not able  to sustain their efforts daily. In these cases, fact finding must be done to  determine the claimant's entitlement to benefits for these days. Each case will  be considered based on all of the claimant's personal circumstances, including  the reasons their efforts were interrupted.\nThe  claimant's efforts must be directed towards obtaining suitable employment (EIR 9.001(c)). Although claimants  may choose to seek more favourable types of employment and wages, they must be  willing to accept suitable employment as described in the legislation.\nWhat  must also be examined are the activities the claimant's efforts consist of,  which may include 1 or more of the following, or any other job search  activities (EIR 9.001(b)):\n\nassessing employment opportunities\npreparing a resume or cover letter\nregistering for job search tools or with electronic job banks or       employment agencies\nattending job search workshops or job fairs\nnetworking\ncontacting prospective employers\nsubmitting job applications\nattending interviews\nundergoing evaluations of competencies\n\nThe  extent to which claimants will use the various job search activities will vary  from claimant to claimant. Usually claimants themselves will know which job  search activities are appropriate for them, although some claimants may need  assistance in determining which activities would be helpful for them. What is  important is the effectiveness of the job search activities chosen by the  claimant. Will they really assist the claimant in becoming re-employed in  suitable employment?\nDepending  on the nature of the employment sought, expending efforts on only certain job  search activities may not enhance the claimant's chances of re-entry into  suitable employment. Nor will it assist certain employers who are seeking  qualified workers, if claimants do not initiate contact with them. For example,  preparing rÃƒÂ©sumÃƒÂ©s and attending job search workshops may assist claimants in  the initial stages of a job search, but it would not necessarily result in  immediate re-employment for the claimant, nor would it assist employers in  identifying potential qualified workers. Generally, such actions must be  followed by efforts to contact employers, submit job applications and attend  job interviews, if the claimant is to actually obtain employment.\nWhen  the evidence shows that there is suitable employment that is vacant or about to  become vacant, or that there are opportunities for suitable employment, the  claimant should be conducting an active search for such employment, in order to  prove that reasonable and customary efforts are being made to obtain suitable  employment (EIA 27(1)(a) and (b)). An employment  vacancy means an actual unoccupied position, while an opportunity is defined as  a situation where there is a good chance of becoming re-employed.\nAlthough  the legislation describes the types of job search efforts that are expected of  claimants, there are no legislative provisions which govern the number of job  search efforts that must be made. What is required is evidence that the  claimant sincerely wishes to put an end to the period of unemployment as  quickly as possible, and that the labour market situation is unfavourable,  despite one's willingness to work, ability and skills. The best evidence that  can be provided to this end  is a  detailed account of one's personal efforts to obtain suitable employment. As  such, claimants are required to keep a detailed account of their job search  efforts, as the Commission may, at any time, request proof of those efforts (EIA 50(8)). Availability must be examined  objectively in light of a claimant's intentions, as shown by their efforts and  in light of the existence of suitable employment. If there is doubt as to whether  or not there are suitable employment opportunities for a particular claimant,  then labour market information must be obtained to clarify the matter.\nDue  to seasonal and geographical circumstances, certain claimants may be faced with  reduced possibilities of obtaining employment in the short term. However,  claimants should not assume that there are absolutely no employment  opportunities for them and decide to make no efforts to find work. Rather, in  order to return to the work force as soon as possible, and to establish  on-going entitlement to benefits, claimants must continue to make efforts to  obtain employment. Besides the job search activities mentioned above, claimants  may also want to talk with former colleagues, friends and resource centres  about potential opportunities; look for potential opportunities in newspapers  and on-line; apply for any suitable employment opportunities, should they  arise; and take any other reasonable steps that may assist them in returning to  work (CUB 73820, CUB 74338, CUB 75655).\nWhere  a claimant has been made aware of their obligations regarding job search  efforts, and disregards the requirement to make reasonable and customary  efforts to obtain suitable employment, a disentitlement from benefits will  likely result. Such was the case where: \n\nno efforts were  made to find employment (CUB 74338, CUB 68263)\na claimant  completed only one job contact in 11 weeks (CUB 73580)\nseasonal workers  who took no steps to find employment while laid off (CUB 65588, CUB 78185)\na claimant who  did nothing to find work for a year and took a break instead (FCA A-940-96, CUB 35648)\na school board  employee who was not seeking temporary work in the summer months (FCA A-652-93)\n\nHowever,  in line with the Commission's policy to warn claimants about potential  availability restrictions (Digest 10.4.2), in cases where there has not  been an intentional disregard for the requirement to make reasonable and  customary efforts to obtain suitable employment, the Commission will remind the  claimant of the job search requirements the claimant is expected to conduct  from that point forward. It is only when claimants continue to ignore these  requirements by unreasonably restricting their job search efforts, and after  they have been given the opportunity to explain why they have continued to  ignore those requirements, that the Commission should consider a disentitlement  from benefits.\nEven  if it is considered that previous job search efforts have been inadequate, a  retroactive disentitlement will be applied only when other circumstances,  besides the inadequate job search itself, indicate that the claimant was  clearly not available for work during the prior period, and/or where there is  evidence of either a false or misleading statement by the claimant, or where  the claimant ought to have known they were not entitled to benefits. Such was  the case where: \n\na claimant had  been self-employed while claiming benefits and had conducted only a minimal job  search during the same period (CUB 72138, CUB 74362)\nwhere the  claimant was restricting her availability to a business she co-owned and had  made no efforts to obtain work elsewhere (CUB 63697)\nwhere there was  no evidence that the claimant had been actively searching for employment while  attending a course of instruction (CUB 79837, CUB 80617)\nwhere a claimant  admitted that she had retired, had no intention of finding other employment and had made no efforts to find work (CUB 65852)",0.98842746

729,729,729,"When someone is trying to start a business or doing the initial work needed to get it going, it's important to figure out if they are truly unemployed while working on their business. Just being unemployed is not enough to receive benefits - they also need to show that they are available to work in other jobs besides their business. When deciding if they are unemployed and available for other work while setting up their business, certain factors like their intentions and the time spent on the business project come into play. If the evidence suggests that they are too focused on their business and not making efforts to find other work, they might not be considered available for work, even if they could be. This is especially true if they devote a lot of time to their business instead of looking for other jobs.

Even if they are available for work, it doesn't mean they are unemployed. For example, someone with a full-time job who is still looking for a better job is not considered unemployed. The rules for determining if someone is unemployed are outlined in Chapter 4 of this guide.

If someone fails to prove they are unemployed, they may lose their benefits for entire weeks. If they earn some money from their business during a partial week, the benefits they receive that week will be reduced based on the income they made from the business. Calculating income from a new business can be tricky, so it's common practice to consider the person unavailable for work during the first few days of their business operation to make the deduction easier. This is because even if they haven't earned much yet, focusing primarily on getting their business up and running instead of seeking other employment means they are considered unavailable for work according to the rules.",64.08448924731185,10.738548387096774,11.038039088145766,13.301075268817204,13.486924731182796,10.51948387096774,50.02688172043011,6.25,0.8549961447715759,0.8524325013160705,2.8190448265586654,0.6011323178988035,0.4601229185417838,0.0689018624348964,4.670967741935484,4.0,2.397874535767457,25.83333333333333,28.0,7.668478046884894,1.3774193548387097,1.0,0.6496697311906952,310,143,0.4612903225806452,1482,12,10.14.3,Starting a business,Chapter 10 - Availability,"In  the case of claimants who are engaged in preliminary work required before going  into business, or those who are about to start operating a business, the first  question to determine is whether they are in fact unemployed (Digest 4.6.2 , Digest 4.6.6 ), while engaged in these  activities. Being unemployed is not all that is required to remain entitled to  benefits; availability for work other than for their business, must also be  proven. When looking at both questions of whether the claimant is unemployed  and available for other work while trying to set up a profitable  business,  some of the factors to consider apply to both issues at the same time,  especially with regards to the claimant's intentions and the amount of time  devoted to the project. Often the 2 issues can be regarded  together and a decision made as to  whether the claimant has proven to be unemployed and available.\nA  claimant's intentions are clear when the facts show a preoccupation with  business preparations and they are not making    any reasonable  and customary efforts to find work, as  required by the legislation. The presumption of non-availability will be even  stronger if the evidence indicates that the claimant devotes  a  significant number of hours to the project, or if this was the  reason for voluntarily leaving or refusing work (CUB 72138, CUB 77869).\nEven  though their availability may be  accepted,  this does not mean that they are unemployed. Even workers who have full-time  employment may at times make considerable efforts to find a better job,  however, this does not amount to being unemployed. The rules to be applied in  determining when a claimant is unemployed are discussed in  chapter 4 of this Digest.\nIn  cases where claimants are disentitled from benefits for failing to prove they  are unemployed, the disentitlement will cover full calendar weeks, since  according to the legislation the question to determine is whether or not each  week  under consideration is a week of  unemployment (EIA 11). As for partial weeks,  the legislation provides for a deduction to be made from the benefits payable  for that week, in proportion to the income arising out of the business for that  week (EIR 35(2), EIR 36(6)). It is often  difficult to assess the income arising out of a business in the first few days  of operation. For this reason, the practice is to consider the claimant as not  available for those days, so that the deduction to be made becomes easily  calculable. This is because, even though they may have received little to no  actual earnings, the fact that their efforts are mainly concentrated on making  their business viable and not on obtaining other suitable employment, amounts  to non-availability for the purposes of the EIA.",0.9898488
730,730,730,"It's common for people who work at a job to also help out with a family business outside of their work hours. This can happen more often when the person is not currently working. This usually occurs when a person's family member owns the business.

The first thing to figure out is whether the help a person is giving to the family business is similar to what an employee of the business would do. Depending on the answer, people in this situation might need to prove that they are not only available to work but that they are also currently not employed. This issue is discussed in chapter 4 of this information.

In terms of being available for work, people getting employment benefits need to show that their main focus is finding a job. They should have proof that they are actively looking for work when asked by the authorities. If a person spends most of their time helping with the family business instead of looking for a job, the presumption is that they are not available for work.",73.31062001227748,8.030128913443829,8.515128840125781,9.812400245549416,9.443235113566608,8.717127071823203,38.34315531000614,3.6666666666666665,0.8212578445672989,0.812696635723114,2.812100519832968,0.5611182992785835,0.4716010639160544,0.0737145436612381,4.419889502762431,4.0,2.266850222785295,20.11111111111111,22.0,7.140564005804279,1.3370165745856353,1.0,0.5966850828729282,181,92,0.5082872928176796,816,9,10.14.4,Family business,Chapter 10 - Availability,"It  is not uncommon for an employed person to  assist  in running a family business after working hours, and it seems reasonable that  the assistance given would  increase  during a  period of unemployment.

The latter issue is  dealt with in chapter 4 of this Digest.\nWith  respect to availability, claimants, as recipients of EI benefits from the  public fund, are required to show that their primary concern is to find  employment. They must be able to provide evidence  of personal efforts to find work,  when requested by the Commission.

731,731,731,"Sometimes people are asked to serve on a jury, which is very important for our legal system. If you're getting employment insurance benefits and have to do jury duty, you can still receive those benefits. Jury duty can include being selected as a juror for a specific trial, being part of a group of potential jurors, or participating in a coroner's inquest.

If you can't work because you're doing jury duty, your benefits won't be affected. But you still need to meet all the other requirements for receiving benefits. If you have to appear as a witness in a criminal trial, it's not the same as doing jury duty.

Court orders can make it difficult to show you're available to work. For instance, if a court orders you to be in a treatment facility like a prison, to stay at home due to a suspended prison sentence, or to be hospitalized for evaluation after a criminal charge, you may not be able to work.

The intent of the legislation is to allow  those individuals to perform their civic duties and continue to receive  employment insurance benefits (EIA 18(1)(c)): \nA claimant is not entitled to be paid benefits for any working day in a benefit period for which the claimant fails to prove that on  that day the claimant was . . .\n(c) engaged in jury service.\nEngagement  in jury service includes not only individuals who have been sworn in as members  of a jury  for a  specific trial, but also those  who have received a  general duty call in which they form a group of potential jurors who may later  be selected to hear specific trials. Jury service also applies to a coroner's inquest.\nA  declaration of non-availability by a claimant for being  engaged in jury service will not result in a disentitlement. A disentitlement  related to capability or availability that is in effect when the claimant is  engaged in jury service will be suspended for that period. However, these  claimants must still fulfill all other qualifying and  entitlement conditions. Receiving a subpoena to appear as  a witness at a criminal trial cannot be equated to jury duty (CUB 69306).\nThe  conditions imposed by a court order will often prevent  a claimant  from establishing their availability for work. Such was the case where a court  order was imposed on a claimant to undergo closed treatment in an establishment  similar to a prison (CUB 59851), where a suspended  sentence of imprisonment gave rise to a court order requiring that the claimant  stay at home (CUB 61368), and where following a  serious criminal charge, a court ordered that a claimant be hospitalized so  that his criminal responsibility could be evaluated (CUB 69572). In addition, a  claimant who takes a leave of absence from employment to care for a child who  is in the claimant's custody pursuant to a court order would not be able to  establish that they are available for work (CUB 70563). Likewise, a claimant  who leaves employment in order to comply with a court order that they reside  with the parent of a child while the parent is caring for the child, would also  be unable to establish their availability for work (CUB 78077).",0.9810021

The situation of each individual in this respect is unique. In other words, it will be necessary to determine to what extent the illness, injury or quarantine has reduced the person's prospects of finding work in either his or her regular or usual occupation or other activities suited to his or her training, aptitudes and abilities or work history   .\nFor example, the fact that a person is incapable of performing all the duties required in his or her usual employment, such as lifting heavy objects, or that the person is only capable of performing simple tasks due to his or her state of health, does not necessarily prevent this person from holding other employment that would be compatible with this restricted capability.\nAlong the same lines, the fact that a person's capabilities decline with age or are reduced by reason of illness or injury does not necessarily mean that this person is irreparably incapable of work. There could very well be other employment suited to the person's condition.\nGenerally, when claimants become incapacitated while employed, the question of whether they are capable of other suitable employment is not an issue, unless there is a chance for claimants to obtain other employment within the short period of their incapacity without jeopardizing their regular employment.\nThen the agent must determine what types of employment would be suitable for that particular claimant and, as well, the actual prospects of obtaining such employment.\nIf the agent determines that, even though the claimant proves limited capability, the possibilities of obtaining employment which would be appropriate to training, skills and abilities or past experience are practically non-existent or make it unrealistic to expect the claimant to undertake such employment, the officer will nevertheless consider the claimant physically unable to work for the purposes of sickness benefits, even if the medical evidence does not support total incapacity.",0.9977729

Some people can still work with their limitations, either because their handicap doesn't stop them from working, they can adapt to the job market, or they can work in a special environment. Drug or alcohol addiction can also make someone unable to work during certain times. They might get treated in an outpatient clinic or be admitted to a clinic for addiction treatment. This treatment shows they can't work, so they might get sickness benefits, unless the confinement is because of a court order.

It should also be understood that only an illness, injury or quarantine affecting the person who is making a claim for benefits is relevant here.\nPregnancy and childbirth are not, strictly speaking, an illness. This, however, does not necessarily mean that a woman who is pregnant or who has just given birth to a child cannot, in some circumstances, make a claim and receive benefits under the sickness benefits provisions .\nA physical or mental disability is not necessarily the equivalent of an inability to work   . Certain persons may prove that they are capable of work within the limits of their capacities, either because their handicap is not an obstacle to employment,  because they were able to adjust to it on the basis of the labour market, or because they have the opportunity to work in a protected work environment.\nDrug and alcohol dependency is without question another factor likely to render a person incapable of work during certain acute phases. It is possible that such a person will be treated in an outpatient clinic or will instead be admitted to a clinic, hospital or specialized centre for addiction treatment. Such a stay constitutes tangible proof that the person is not able to work, in which case the payment of sickness benefits will be considered, unless the admission is a condition of mandatory confinement which is occasionally imposed by courts of law in their sentences. Such mandatory confinement may be regarded as a stay in an institution similar to a prison .",0.9729614
738,738,738,"To get sick benefits, a person needs a note from a doctor or certain other medical professionals. The note must say why the person can't work, when it started, how long it might last, and be signed by the medical professional. Doctors from the US or Canada are good to sign this note, and so are registered nurses in some cases. Other health professionals like psychologists, dentists, or nurse practitioners can also sign the note if they're treating the illness.

Some professionals like massage therapists or acupuncturists can't sign the note. The regulations by the Commission say that a person claiming benefits because they're sick must provide a note from a doctor or medical professional.

Sometimes, a person may not need to show the note right away to get benefits. But it's a good idea to get the note from the doctor just in case. Just because a person has a note from a doctor doesn't mean they'll automatically get benefits.

On this subject, the  Regulations say that the information and evidence to be provided to the  Commission by a claimant in order to prove inability to work because of  illness, injury or quarantine pursuant to paragraph 18(b) of the Act, is a  medical certificate completed by a medical doctor or other medical professional  attesting to the claimant's inability to work and stating the probable duration  of the illness, injury or quarantine.\nThe individual is not always required to submit the medical certificate to the Commission, in order to receive sickness benefits. When applying for sickness benefits, the person is advised to obtain a medical certificate from their doctor and either submit it immediately, or keep it in a safe place as it may be required at a later date.\nIn some instances, the individual's statement of being unable to work because of illness may not be sufficient. The same can be said that providing a medical certificate does not necessarily prove a person's inability to work. It is possible that the information in the medical certificate is not along the same lines as the individual's statements.\nThe Commission may also consider that there is no inability to work or that the proof provided will only cover part of the alleged period of inability to work.

739,739,739,"The person who decides if someone is eligible for sickness benefits needs to gather and evaluate a lot of information and medical documents about the person's health. It's important for this person to have the tools and resources to determine if the information provided is valid. 

Normally, a person's doctor, especially a specialist, is the best person to judge the person's health condition. The doctor's role regarding benefits is to give or confirm any necessary information about the illness, injury, how long the person might be unable to work, and any other related details. However, the doctor doesn't have the final say on who gets sickness benefits. That decision lies with the Commission, which must follow the rules set out in the law.

Sometimes, more information about a person's health might be needed to decide if they qualify for sickness benefits. In some cases, an independent medical exam might be required to confirm certain details, clear up doubts, or understand complex health situations. If the Commission thinks an independent medical exam is necessary, they can ask for one. It's important for the person claiming benefits to attend this exam, as failing to do so might lead to benefits being denied.

If the Commission does require an independent medical exam, they get to choose the doctor for the exam. However, if the person claiming benefits has a valid reason for not agreeing to the first doctor chosen, the Commission will choose a different one. The goal is to ensure that there's trust between the person and the doctor conducting the exam.

Not all cases will need these extra steps. It depends on how good the information is regarding whether the first condition for receiving benefits is met.",56.81097701149426,10.138275862068966,12.68835289967788,13.526436781609195,10.990839080459772,11.075448275862064,44.50574712643678,4.866666666666666,0.8434214251382011,0.8693609742017893,2.7874177025134363,0.5508839532174755,0.449630025416041,0.084236944379171,4.8310344827586205,4.0,2.5452597521092994,19.33333333333333,18.0,5.497474167490214,1.5413793103448277,1.0,0.8051631838797564,290,137,0.4724137931034483,1452,15,11.2.3,Other means and sources of information,Chapter 11 - Sickness benefits,"The agent who makes the decision on the claimant's entitlement to sickness benefits must be in a position to gather and judge a multitude of sometimes contradictory information and medical declarations concerning the state of a person's health. It is therefore essential for the agent to have the means and resources to facilitate the determination of the validity of the statements.\nThe attending physician, especially a specialist in the field, is generally the best judge of a person's state of health. The physician's role in respect of benefits comes down to providing or certifying any information considered appropriate concerning the nature of the illness, injury or quarantine, the probable duration of the inability to work and any other circumstances related thereto.\nThe attending physician does not decide on the entitlement to sickness benefits. That responsibility rather, belongs to the Commission, which must rule on the various conditions to entitlement, provided for in the Act.\nWhen determining entitlement to sickness benefits, clarification or additional information concerning a person's state of health may be required. As well, a variety of situations may arise where an independent medical examination will be considered necessary to counterbalance certain information already entered in the file, to dispel certain doubts as to a person's state of health or to help clarify cases of inability that are complex, ambiguous or contradictory. In these cases, the Commission has full authority to require an independent medical examination if it considers it appropriate to do so. This is a formal obligation for the claimant, and a failure to comply with this direction may be grounds for denying benefits   .\nIf the Commission does consider that an independent medical examination is required, the choice of the independent medical examiner rests with the Commission. However, considering the intimate nature of such examinations and the need for a relationship of trust between the claimant and the physician, the Commission will provide the choice of another medical examiner where the claimant objects to the first selection, unless the reasons invoked are frivolous or trifling.\nIt is reasonable to conclude that not all these means and resources will be used in every case. It will depend on the quality of the information gathered in relation to the first entitlement condition to fulfill.",0.960664
740,740,740,"The rule for getting sickness benefits includes proving that a person can't work due to an illness, injury, or being quarantined, and also showing that they would have been ready to work if not for being sick or injured. The only exceptions are for people getting parental benefits or compassionate care benefits under the law.

People getting parental or compassionate care benefits who want to switch to sickness benefits and can prove they're unable to work don't need to prove they would have been ready for work.

When someone applies for sickness benefits, they must not only show they can't work due to illness, injury, or quarantine but also prove they would have been ready to work if not for being sick. This rule ensures that only people who would have been ready to work, if they hadn't been sick or injured, get sickness benefits. Many factors, like the reason someone can't work, their personal situation, and what they would have done if not sick, are considered to see if they would have been ready to work.

If the inability to work happens when the person is already not available for work for a different reason, it can be hard to prove they would have been ready to work. For example, if someone couldn't work because they were already on leave from their job before getting sick. The situation might only come up once the person is too sick to work. In such cases, what the person would have likely done if they weren't sick is important.

If someone takes advantage of being unable to work by doing activities not related to work, such as taking a course or going on holiday, it might be hard to prove they would have been ready for work. However, if they're outside Canada, a different rule applies for benefits. If they use their time off work to prepare for starting a business or focusing on other non-job activities, their eligibility for benefits might be questioned.

People on a break from work, like a sabbatical, who get sick can claim sickness benefits. It's usually difficult for them to prove they would have been ready for work unless the sickness delays their return to work. In that case, they could show they would have been ready to work on the original date they were supposed to go back to work.

People receiving parental or compassionate care benefits can switch to sickness benefits if they show they're unable to work without having to prove they would have been ready for work.",69.2212254901961,9.91734749455338,11.442366930564871,13.498039215686276,12.35095179738562,9.345462962962962,44.16176470588235,4.764705882352941,0.8911807611584663,0.9056993007659913,3.0628262017519288,0.5554442462334669,0.460338573219227,0.0614476789471479,4.474537037037037,4.0,2.1951756380667105,25.41176470588235,26.0,8.616392199341439,1.3217592592592593,1.0,0.663665925419118,432,145,0.3356481481481481,2006,17,11.3.0,Second entitlement condition: to be otherwise available for work,Chapter 11 - Sickness benefits,"In addition to the requirement of having to demonstrate that the individual is incapable of work by reason of a prescribed illness, injury or quarantine, that individual would also have to demonstrate that he would have been available for work, if it were not for the illness, injury or quarantine.\nThe only exception to this section of the Act is for claimants who are in receipt of QuÃƒÂ©bec Parental Insurance Plan (QPIP) parental benefits or EI parental, compassionate care or family caregiver benefits. Section 18 (2) of the Act stipulates that:\n2. A claimant to whom benefits are payable under any of sections 23 to 23.2 is not disentitled under paragraph (1)(b) for failing to prove that he or she would have been available for work were it not for the illness, injury or quarantine.\nClaimants in receipt of EI parental, compassionate care or family caregiver benefits who wish to convert to sickness benefits, and who provide proof of incapacity, are exempt from showing they would otherwise be available for work.\nAn individual who makes a claim for sickness benefits is not only required to demonstrate being unable to work because of a prescribed illness, injury or quarantine, but also to demonstrate that he would be otherwise available for work. The purpose of this second entitlement condition  is to pay sickness benefits only to individuals who would be otherwise available, if they had not been unable to work because of the prescribed illness, the injury or the quarantine.\nWhether the individual would be otherwise available for work if it had not been for the prescribed illness, the injury or the  quarantine will be determined in the same way as if the individual was able to work. The reason for separation, the individual's personal situation, his intentions if he had not been incapable of working, and other requirements and restrictions in relation to the labour market, are all factors that reflect on otherwise availability for work during the period of incapacity. The chronology of events may also be very revealing evidence in this determination. \nIf the inability to work arises when there is already a current disentitlement on the ground of non-availability, or a situation that would be grounds for disentitlement, it may be difficult for the individual to demonstrate that he would be otherwise available for work. For example, where the inability arose after the person was not available to work for their usual employer because he was on leave of absence.\nIt is quite possible that the situation will only arise once the period of inability to work is under way or at the same time as that period. The question then is, what would this individual have been doing, had he not been incapable of working? The situation may be one that was expected or planned, that is totally unrelated to the inability, and in respect of which the person could not in normal circumstances prove that he would have been available. An example might be a specific period of holidays or leave of absence that the claimant had scheduled prior to their inability to work, and actually took, in spite of his or her inability to work.\nA person may want to take advantage of a period of inability and, instead of doing nothing, signs up for a part-time short-duration training course or spends the period of convalescence at a place away from home, such as the cottage. Because such situations would not have arisen if the individual would had been able to work, it cannot be said that in such situations the individual has not proven that he was otherwise available for work for that period. On the other hand, entitlement to benefits would be considered under a separate section of the EI legislation, in the case of a stay outside Canada.\nThe situation would be different if, for example, a claimant was to decide to take advantage of a long period of inability to work, to look after preparations for a business, increase the level of activity with the aim of eventually working on his or her own account, or expending a significant part of his or her time and energy on a job that was only secondary before the inability arose. In such a case, whether the person is actually unemployed, otherwise available for work, and unable to hold any other suitable employment will be open to question.\nThose who withdraw from the labour market while on sabbatical leave may also be affected by illness, injury or quarantine and make a claim for sickness benefits. Such persons cannot usually prove that they would be otherwise available for work unless that inability to work has delayed their return to the labour market. In this last case, they may show that they would be otherwise available as of the original date on which they were scheduled to return to work.\nClaimants in receipt of EI parental, compassionate care or family caregiver benefits who provide proof of incapacity can convert their claim to sickness benefits without having to meet the requirement to be otherwise available for work.",0.9987804

In that case had the claimant not agreed initially to participate in such an activity, he or she would be entitled to receive sickness benefits.\nThis provision does not affect a minor attachment claimant whose inability prevents the carrying out of activities as a self-employed person or from engaging in the operation of a business on his or her own account or in partnership or a co-adventure.

The rules say that usually, if you're not in Canada, you can't get benefits. But there's an exception. If you're outside of Canada to get medical treatment that you can't easily get in Canada, then you might still be able to get benefits.

In general, if you're outside of Canada for medical treatment that's not easily available in Canada, and if you meet all the usual criteria to get sickness benefits, you might still be eligible. It doesn't matter if you got sick before or during your trip.

You have to show that you'd still be able to work if you weren't getting treatment. The treatment must be in a hospital or similar place in another country, and it has to be something that's not easily found in Canada.

There are different reasons why someone might choose to get treatment outside of Canada, like how urgently they need it, how close they live to the treatment place, or how good the treatment is. The most important thing is that the treatment isn't something you could easily get in Canada.

If the treatment you're getting is something that's not common in Canada, the person who decides on your benefits will check to make sure the place where you're getting treatment is officially recognized.",75.92588859416448,7.65685823754789,9.851270322608157,10.789389920424403,9.000415561450048,8.18314176245211,38.850869437076334,3.769230769230769,0.7999575684467951,0.8014784075997092,2.958574870148233,0.8857660657971325,0.4400608279988428,0.0726221485902309,4.329501915708812,4.0,2.2073222237411594,20.07692307692308,17.0,9.40917341633675,1.3065134099616855,1.0,0.5920253153017225,261,107,0.4099616858237548,1202,13,11.6.6,Outside Canada,Chapter 11 - Sickness benefits,"It happens from time to time that a person who is temporarily unable to work plans to spend part of his or her convalescence in milder climates outside Canada or, conversely, that a person who is outside Canada suddenly becomes unable to work. Both are entitled to ask whether the situation in question is detrimental to claiming sickness benefits.\nIt should be said right away that in this respect the EI Act has imposed the following rigorous provisions   :\nExcept as may otherwise be prescribed, a claimant is not entitled to receive benefits for any period during which the claimant\n\n\u2026\nis not in Canada.\n\nThe exception mentioned above is found primarily in the following provision of the Regulations   :\n\u2026 a claimant is not disentitled from receiving benefits for the reason that the claimant is outside Canada \u2026 for the purpose of undergoing, at a hospital, medical clinic or similar facility outside Canada, medical treatment that is not readily or immediately available in the claimant's area of residence in Canada, if the hospital, clinic or facility is accredited to provide the medical treatment by the appropriate governmental authority outside Canada.\nThus, with the exceptions of a person whose most recent interruption of earnings is from insurable employment outside of Canada    and of a person who is absent for specified reasons and duration   , it can be said in general terms that a person must satisfy two specific conditions in addition to the two entitlement conditions to sickness benefits   .\nThe person who is outside Canada must in fact be undergoing medical treatment in a hospital, medical clinic or similar facility located in a country other than Canada, and the treatment as such must be medical treatment that is not readily available in the claimant's area of residence in Canada.\nThe Act leaves no room for other circumstances that could occur where a person might, for personal reasons or on the recommendation of a physician, have to stay outside the country, even with a medical certificate establishing the inability to work   .\nThe prescription is not limited to a person whose inability to work arose before his or her stay outside Canada. It also applies to a person whose inability to work arose while he or she was outside the country. Both must show that they satisfy the two conditions specified in the Regulations.\nThe question whether the person proves that he or she would be otherwise available for work is always relevant in such a case   .\nIt must be understood that the person must undergo the treatment in a hospital, medical clinic or similar facility in a country other than Canada, and that it must be a medical treatment that is not readily available in the claimant's area of residence in Canada. It must not be a miracle treatment or any kind of cure that is claimed to be the panacea for all illnesses, but a treatment that, while not necessarily conventional, may be seen as being relatively effective and is recognized by a scientific or medical authority   .\nThere are several factors that might lead someone who is unable to work to undergo medical treatment in a country other than Canada. It might be due to, amongst others: the urgency of the situation as opposed to the immediate availability of the treatment in a Canadian health institution, the proximity of the residence to the treatment centre, the supposed quality of care, or the technological advancements and expertise of certain medical science authorities or clinics renowned for the treatment of certain illnesses or for certain procedures.\nWhat is critical to determine is whether the treatment is a type that is not readily available in the claimant's area of residence in Canada. The agent will make that determination. It is not necessary that the claimant be hospitalised.\nA facility outside Canada that offers a treatment prescribed in Canada is considered to be an accredited facility.

Maternity benefits give money to the parent to make up for not being able to work. These benefits are different from parental benefits, which are for taking care of the child. 

In Quebec, there is a different plan called the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan (QPIP) that gives benefits for having a child or adopting one. This plan is for parents who live in Quebec.

The underlying principle for the payment of these benefits under the current Employment Insurance (EI) program is that birth parents should be provided with a level of protection from the loss of earnings caused by the physical inability to work or to seek work, in the weeks surrounding the birth of a child.\nMaternity benefits are therefore paid to the birth parent to compensate for a period of physical inability to work, associated with pregnancy and childbirth. They are distinct from parental benefits, which are paid to parents to provide actual care for a child.\nThe QuÃƒÂ©bec Parental Insurance Plan (QPIP) applies to claims for benefits relating to a birth or adoption of a child, for parents residing in QuÃƒÂ©bec. The EI program applies to any claim relating to a birth or an adoption of a child for parents residing outside QuÃƒÂ©bec.\nThis does not mean, however, that maternity benefits under the EI program are not payable in QuÃƒÂ©bec or that the impact of the QPIP is limited to QuÃƒÂ©bec.\nAmong other rules, the principle of equivalence between benefits paid under the QPIP and the EI program, guarantees equity in the processing of claims for EI benefits filed throughout Canada, including QuÃƒÂ©bec.

If parents share the benefits, they must both choose either standard or extended benefits. Each parent cannot receive more than 35 weeks of standard benefits or 61 weeks of extended benefits.

To qualify for parental benefits, the parent must have experienced an interruption of earnings and worked 600 hours in the qualifying period. When applying for benefits, the parent must provide details about the child's birth date or adoption placement. If there was a previous issue regarding benefits, the parent may need more than 600 hours of work to qualify.

The parent must prove that the child was placed with them for adoption and that the placement followed adoption laws in their province. If the parent intends to adopt the child, they may be eligible for parental benefits. If the adoption does not proceed, benefits will stop after the child is removed, and the parent must inform the authorities.

They may be paid to any of the biological parents, legal parents or parent with whom the child is placed for the purpose of adoption, or may be shared between parents (EI Act 23(4)), to a combined maximum of 40 weeks of standard parental benefits or 69 weeks of extended parental benefits  When parental benefits are shared, both parents must receive benefits under the same option, standard or extended.  One parent cannot receive more than 35 weeks of standard parental benefits or 61 weeks of extended parental benefits.\nThe individual claiming the parental benefits must have experienced an interruption of earnings (EI Act 7; EI Regulation 14(2)), and have 600 hours of insurable employment in the qualifying period (EI Act 23(1), EI Act 6(1)). The claimant must provide a declaration as to the newborn's date of birth, or, when the placement is for the purposes of adoption, the child's date of placement with the claimant and the name and address of the adoption authority.\nIn situations where a violation had been assessed on a previous claim, the claimant will require more than 600 hours of insurable employment during the qualifying period to be eligible for parental benefits. Violations range from minor to subsequent (EI Act 7.1(1); Digest 18.10.6) with a related increase in the number of hours required to qualify for benefits.\nPlacements for the purpose of an adoption made by an agency or individual authorized to make such placements under applicable provincial laws governing adoption are recognized under Section 23 of the EI Act . In addition to intra-provincial placements for adoption, the legislation in several provinces also covers interprovincial and international adoptions. Accordingly, parental benefits may be paid to the claimant with whom a child from the claimant's province, another province or another country has been placed for the purpose of adoption, provided that such placement has been made in accordance with the laws that apply in the province or territory where the claimant resides. Parental benefits are also payable to a claimant who attests that it is their intent to adopt a child placed with them by a recognized authority because circumstances exist that render the legally recognized parent(s) incapable of caring for the child (FCA A-136-12; CUB 78779).\nTo establish whether a claimant is entitled to parental benefits under Section 23 of the Act, the following needs to be determined:\n\nWas the child placed with the claimant?\nWas the placement of the child for the purpose of adoption?\nWas it according to laws governing adoption in the province in which the claimant resides? \r\n        Or\nWas the child placed with the claimant by a recognized authority because circumstances exist that renders the legally recognized parent(s) incapable of caring for the child; and\nDoes the claimant attest that they consider the placement a permanent one and it is their intention to adopt the child?\n\nWhen a claimant is requesting EI parental benefits for a child that has been placed with them by a recognized authority, benefits under Section 23 of the EI Act may be payable if it is the claimant's intention to adopt the child. \nIn cases where the child is not legally adoptable at the time the child is placed with the claimant by a recognized authority, parental benefits may be payable if the claimant attests that they consider the placement a permanent one and that it is their intent to adopt the child placed with them at the earliest opportunity. Although a verbal attestation is acceptable, the Commission may, at any time, request proof that the child was placed with them by a recognized authority and that the placement was not merely a temporary one.\nIn any adoption situation for which parental benefits have been correctly allowed under Section 23 of the Act, should the adoption fail to proceed for any reason, or should a claimant's intention to adopt change, the claimant's entitlement to EI parental benefits would cease the earlier of: 1) the first Sunday after the child is removed from the adoptive home; or, 2) the first Sunday following the official termination of the adoption proceedings. No over payment would be created.  It is the claimant's responsibility to inform the Commission if the adoption fails to proceed or if their intent to adopt changes.\nChild legally adoptable or not legally adoptable \nIn the case of a child that is legally adoptable on the placement date, the Commission can at any time request proof that the adoption process has started. Should the Commission request it, the claimant must provide a letter issued by the recognized adoption authority certifying that an official adoption file has been opened by the claimant for the purpose of adopting the child for whom they are claiming parental benefits. This letter will constitute proof that a child has been placed for the purpose of adoption and that the placement was made under the laws governing adoption in the province in which the claimant resides. \nIn cases where the child is not legally adoptable, a verbal attestation from the claimant that they consider the placement a permanent one and that it is their intent to adopt the child placed with them at the earliest opportunity is acceptable.  In these circumstances, the Commission may, at any time, request proof from the claimant certifying that the child for whom they are claiming parental benefits as been placed with them by a recognized authority and that the placement was not merely a temporary one. \nThe following lists some of the various placement processes, some of which entitle the claimant to benefits effective the date of placement, others on later dates and others not at all. \n\nNote: \nIn some cases the child may not be legally adoptable on the placement date.  In these cases, the above criteria apply.  Additional information may be requested in specific cases.\n\n1. Foster to Adopt program \nUnder a Foster to Adopt program or other similar programs, a child is placed for the purpose of adoption prior to the natural parents having consented to the adoption or having relinquished their rights to the child.\nEntitlement to EI is proven from the date of placement if the following criteria are met:\n\nthe child was physically placed with the claimant for the purpose of adoption; and\nthe claimant has demonstrated a commitment to adopt the child under the laws governing adoption in the province or territory in which the claimant resides.\n\n2. Private adoption \nIn the case of a private adoption, if the claimant can submit a letter from their attorney demonstrating that the adoption process has started or attest that it is their intent to adopt the child placed with them at the earliest opportunity, the placement will be considered to have been made for the purpose of adoption and parental benefits are payable.\n3. Resource foster families \nResource foster families commit to adopting a child placed with them if that child is unable to return to its birth family or a kinship placement cannot be arranged. The foster family is aware that efforts are being undertaken by the adoption authority to return the child to its birth family or to find the child a kinship placement. They understand that, in some cases, the child may leave their care should these efforts be successful.\nEntitlement to parental benefits is proven from the date the claimant officially opens a file with the recognized adoption authority for the purposes of adopting the child or, in cases where the child is not legally adoptable, from the date the claimant attests that it is their intent to adopt the child placed with them and that they consider the placement a permanent one.\n4. Adoption not in the best interest of the child \nA placement may be accepted when, instead of an adoption, the claimant has been granted permanent, legal custody because it is in the best interest of the child not to proceed with an adoption. In other words, such a situation may be effectively, but not technically an adoption. Fact finding must be conducted in these cases in order to determine that the placement is permanent. \nFor example, a Court could choose to issue a Permanent Custody Order rather than an Adoption order because an Adoption Order could be to the detriment of the child.  The Court could deem that a Permanent Custody Order is effectively an adoption situation since it would give the claimant an identical role, responsibility and permanency that an Adoption Order would have bestowed. Such cases of permanent custody would be treated as adoptions and benefits would be payable to the claimant. \n5. Foster care \nA child placed for the purpose of foster care is not the same as being placed for the purpose of adoption. If a child is placed with a claimant for the purpose of foster care, and the foster parent (claimant) later pursues adopting that child, parental benefits are only payable once the adoption process has commenced. The opening of an official file with a recognized adoption authority for the purpose of adopting that child will be considered as the start of the adoption process and parental benefits will become payable effective on that date, or, in cases where the child is not legally adoptable, from the date the child is placed with the claimant having attested that they consider the placement a permanent one and that they intend to adopt the child.\n6. Temporary or permanent custody of a child \nParental benefits may be payable if a child is placed with a claimant who has been awarded permanent or temporary custody of that child because circumstances exist that renders the legally recognized parent(s) incapable of caring for the child if:\n\nthe claimant attests that they consider the placement a permanent one and that it is their intention to adopt the child, and \nthe child was placed with the claimant by a recognized authority. \n\nParental benefits are payable effective the date the claimant attests that it is their intention to adopt the child that was placed with them by the recognized authority or in cases where the child is legally adoptable, from the date the claimant provides proof that an official adoption file has been opened for the purpose of adopting the child for whom they are claiming parental benefits.\n7. Legally recognized parents \nIn some situations, a claimant who is not the child's biological or adoptive parent, may still be recognized as the child's legal parent. If that person is recognized as the child's legal parent on the provincial or territorial birth certificate, that person will be eligible to receive parental benefits, provided the qualifying conditions to establish a claim have been met. If the claimant cannot be recognized by the province as a parent on the birth registration, that person will not be entitled to parental benefits unless an adoption process has been started or, in cases where the child is not legally adoptable, from the date the claimant attests that it is their intent to adopt the child placed with them.\n8. Native custom adoption governed by the Indian Act  \nParental benefits are payable in respect of a native custom adoption when the adoption is governed by the Indian Act.\nCanadian courts have long recognized the notion of native custom adoption. In doing so, the courts have provided the following criterion that can be applied to determine if a custom adoption has taken place:\n\nthere is consent between the natural and adopting parents;\nthe child has been voluntarily placed with the adopting parents;\nthe adopting parents are indeed native or entitled to rely on native custom; and\nthe rationale for native custom adoptions is present.\n\nThe rationale for native custom adoptions has been held by the court to mean that it is necessary for the survival of child whose parents were unable to care for them, or who had died. Other jurisprudence has noted that the term rationale for native custom adoption means that there is a recognized reason within the scope of the custom, whether it be to provide for children without parents, or otherwise, for the adoption to take place.\nIf the adoption does not meet the criteria listed above, it must be clear that the claimant has officially opened a file with a recognized adoption authority for the purpose of adopting the child for whom they are seeking parental benefits or, in cases where the child is not legally adoptable, from the date the claimant attests that it is their intent to adopt the child placed with them.\n9. QuÃƒÂ©bec Parental Insurance Plan \nSince January 1, 2006, maternity and parental benefits have been available under the QuÃƒÂ©bec Parental Insurance Plan. There is a regulatory provision providing that a person who is entitled to receive benefits from a provincial plan in respect to the birth or adoption of a child is disentitled to maternity or parental benefits under the EI program in respect of this same birth or adoption (Regulation 76.09(1)).\nThe regulatory provision is respecting individuals claiming benefits under different plans, as in the context where one of the parents is residing outside Quebec and the other parent is residing in Quebec at the beginning of the period for which the first parent claims benefits in respect of the birth or adoption of their child (Regulation 76.21).\nEligible parents can share the number of weeks of parental benefits payable under the EI program and the parental or adoption benefits payable under the QuÃƒÂ©bec Parental Insurance Plan for a same birth or adoption of a child.\nAccording to the regulation, the maximum number of weeks of standard parental benefits that can be paid to a parent cannot exceed the maximum number of  40 weeks less the number of weeks of provincial benefits that have been paid to the claimant governed by the provincial plan, taking into account, where appropriate, the weeks of benefits that are paid at the accelerated rate under the provincial plan.  An EI parent cannot receive more than 35 weeks of standard or 61 weeks of extended parental benefits.\nIn cases of extended parental benefits, the maximum number of weeks of benefits that can be paid to a parent are determined by using the following formula:\n(A-B) x C/D\nFor the purposes of the above formula, A is 40, the maximum number of weeks of standard parental benefits when the weeks of benefits are divided; B is the number of weeks of provincial benefits that are paid to the claimant governed by the provincial plan, taking into account, where appropriate, the weeks of benefits that are paid at the accelerated rate under the provincial plan; C is 61, the maximum number of weeks of extended parental benefits payable per benefit period; and D is 35, the maximum number of weeks of standard parental benefits payable per benefit period (EI Act 12(3)(b)(i) and (ii)).",0.9940416
783,783,783,"Parental benefits can be given to biological, adoptive, or legal parents, and can be shared between parents. Before getting parental benefits, there is a waiting period that needs to be served, except in certain situations like if the parent received sick leave pay from their employer or if they worked for more than one employer and received sick leave pay from one of them. 

According to the law, if one parent has already served the waiting period for a child, the other parent can defer their waiting period. When parents decide to share benefits and apply at the same time, they can choose which parent will serve the waiting period. It's important to note that a deferred waiting period is different from one that is waived.

Each parent is only required to serve one waiting period for one child. If a second benefit period is needed, the waiting period can be deferred. If the waiting period was waived for one parent, the other parent would need to serve the waiting period unless they also received sick leave pay. 

In Quebec, benefits under the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan can waive the waiting period as well.",63.08579808234634,9.897935702199664,10.74609503303851,12.00428652002256,11.343023124647488,10.098680203045683,42.19345741680768,4.444444444444445,0.8677780255675316,0.8596509865352085,2.9837039917802164,0.5606270258987279,0.4075207237787454,0.0608919823055006,4.634517766497462,4.0,2.098688591235928,21.88888888888889,17.0,10.2896328024802,1.4365482233502538,1.0,0.6547633074564119,197,90,0.4568527918781725,935,9,13.1.3,Waiting period,Chapter 13 - Parental benefits,"As already indicated parental benefits are unique in that they may be paid to biological, legal or adoptive parents or may be shared between the parents. Like all claims for unemployment benefits a waiting period must be served (EI Act 13) before parental benefits can be paid under the EI Act.\nThe waiting period may be waived if, after having ceased work, the claimant received sick leave paid by his employer (Regulation 40(6)) or when the claimant works for more than one employer, if he was paid sick leave pay after ceasing work from one of these employers and had an interruption of earnings for the same employer. Additionally moneys payable by an employer as parental leave pay are not considered to be earnings in the waiting period (Regulation 39(3)(b)).\nThe Employment Insurance legislation provides that only one waiting period must be served in respect of the same child. In situations where the first parent made a claim for benefits, served the waiting period and during this benefit period, claimed maternity and/or parental benefits, the waiting period can be deferred for any other parent  claiming parental benefits in respect of the same child (EI Act 23(5)).\nWhen parents decide to share parental benefits and apply simultaneously, they may choose which one will serve the waiting period.  This allows the other parents to defer their waiting periods.  Note that a deferred waiting period is not the same as a waiting period that is waived; a waiting period that is deferred must be served before a parent can receive regular, sickness, compassionate care or family caregiver benefits on the same claim.\nIt should be noted that a claimant is only required to serve one waiting period when claiming benefits in respect of one new-born or adoptive child. In the event that a second benefit period is required to ensure the claimant can receive all parental benefits the legislation allows, the waiting period can be deferred on the second claim.\nWaiving the waiting period should not be confused with deferring the waiting period. In the event that the waiting period was waived for the first parent, another parent would be required to serve the waiting period as a waiting period was not previously served in respect of the same child. The only exception to this would be in a situation where the other parent also received sick leave pay from his employer or when the claimant works for more than one employer, if he was paid sick leave pay after ceasing work from one of these employers and had an interruption of earnings for the same employer, the conditions have been met to waive the waiting period.\nA regulation in the context of the implementation of the QuÃƒÂ©bec Parental Insurance Plan authorizes waiving the waiting period where benefits have been paid under a provincial plan such as the QPIP (Regulation 76.22).",0.99158466

Now, parents are not required to stay at home the entire time while receiving these benefits. They can go out to take care of their child's needs and still get the benefits. Each situation is looked at individually to make sure the parent is able to care for their child. Even if a child is in the hospital, the parent is still considered responsible for them and can receive parental benefits. The same goes for parents who go on vacation while receiving these benefits.

It is unreasonable to expect a parent to cease all regular activity and simply remain at home for 35 or 61 weeks doing nothing more than caring for the child. While the intent of the legislation is to allow the parent to bond with and care for the child, the requirement of caring for the child is met when the parent is providing for the needs of the child. This means a claimant may leave the home for periods of time and continue to receive parental benefits, whether the child is with the parent during these activities or not. A reasoned approach should be taken and each case should be decided on its own merit having regard for the intent to allow a parent to care for the child. It has been argued that a child who is admitted to hospital cannot be considered to be in the care of the parent, therefore no entitlement to parental benefits exists. The reality of this situation is that the parent continues to be responsible for the child. Furthermore, in many cases the parent's presence and assistance is specifically requested by either the doctor or the hospital.\nThis same reasoning holds true for those claimants who decide to take a vacation while in receipt of parental benefits. Because payment of these benefits has no tie to availability, a claimant can indeed be on vacation and be entitled to parental benefit. Similarly, the reason for separation from employment is not a factor in determining entitlement to parental benefits as any disqualification imposed on a claim will be deferred or suspended during receipt of parental benefits (Digest 13.3.4).",0.97045016

If you qualify for special benefits due to a regulatory exception but not for regular benefits under the EI Act, you can only receive special benefits in your benefit period.

This conversion will help determine how many more weeks of regular benefits and special benefits can be paid to reach the equivalent of 50 weeks paid at 55% and what the applicable benefit period extension should be.  Any benefit period extensions will be added at week 52 of the claim.  As stated in EI Act Section 10(13.02), the extension applied to facilitate the payment of extended parental benefits cannot exceed 26 weeks\nThe conversion table from extended parental benefits weeks to standard parental benefit weeks is included in Annex 1 . The conversion table from standard parental benefit weeks to extended parental benefit weeks is included in  Annex 2.These annexes are found at the end of this chapter. \nOnly benefit types that were paid in the initial benefit period can be paid in the extension period provided all entitlement conditions are still met . \nFor the purposes of calculating the cap of 50 weeks, weeks in which the claimant returns to work or does not receive benefits for a reason other than those listed in subsections 10(10) to (12.1) and section 13 of the EI Act, whether during the initial benefit period or extended benefit period, will be deemed to be weeks for which benefits were paid at a weekly benefit rate of 55%.  For example: if the claimant returns to work for two weeks during the initial benefit period these two weeks will be weeks deemed paid for the purposes of calculating the cap of 50 weeks paid at 55%.  The conversion calculation should occur at the point where the claimant reaches 50 weeks paid or  deemed paid on the claim. \nAs stated above, for the purpose of calculating the cap, we would not include weeks in which the claimant did not receive benefits because the claimant was: \n\nConfined in a jail, penitentiary or other similar institution and was not found guilty of the offence for which the claimant was being held or any other offence arising out of the same transaction. \nIn receipt of earnings paid because of the  complete severance of their relationship with their former employer.\nIn receipt of workers' compensation payments for an illness or injury.\nIn receipt of payments under a provincial law on the basis of having ceased to work because continuing to work would have resulted in danger to the claimant, her unborn child or a child whom she was breast-feeding.\nServing the waiting period.\n\nAdditionally, weeks of extension for the hospitalization of a child or weeks in which members of the Canadian Forces have had to defer their parental leave or end it early to return to active duty, are not included in the calculation of the cap of 50 weeks paid at 55%.\nWorksharing weeks are not included in the calculation of the 50 weeks paid at 55% when regular and special benefit, including extended parental benefits, are combined during the initial benefit period.  \nExample 1:\nA claimant becomes ill and receives 10 weeks of sickness benefits. He then applies for extended parental benefits and receives 15 weeks.  The claimant is laid off from his employment in week 26 of the claim and applies for regular benefits. After proving his availability for work, the claimant receives 25 weeks of regular benefits up to week 51 of the benefit period.  As the claimant received regular benefits and extended parental benefits in the initial benefit period, a conversion calculation must be completed to determine the cap of 50 weeks and the benefit period extension.\nAt week 51, using  the table found in Annex 1,  the 15 weeks of extended parental benefits paid in the initial benefit period are converted to 9 weeks of standard parental benefits.  In order to determine how many weeks at the 55% benefit rate can still be paid  within the 50 week cap, 10 weeks of sickness benefits, 9 weeks of converted parental benefits and 25 weeks of regular benefits must be subtracted from the cap of 50 standard weeks.  At week 51 there are 6 weeks of benefits that can still be paid at the 55% benefit rate. \nAt week 52, the benefit period is extended by 6 weeks to allow the claimant to be paid up to the equivalent of 50 weeks at 55%. \nExample 2: \nA claimant is laid off from their employment and establishes a claim for regular benefits.  After receiving 36 weeks of regular benefits, the claimant converts their claim to extended parental benefits and receives 10 weeks of benefits.  The claimant becomes ill and requests 2 weeks of sickness benefits before resuming payment of extended parental benefits. The claimant receives two more weeks of extended parental benefits before 50 weeks of benefits are paid on the claim.\nAt week 51, using the table found in Annex 1,  the 12 weeks of extended parental benefits paid in the initial benefit period are converted to 7 weeks of standard parental benefits. In order to determine how many weeks at the 55% benefit rate can still be paid within the 50 week cap, 36 weeks of rgular benefits, 7 weeks of converted parental benefits and 2 weeks of sickness benefits must be subtracted from the cap of 50 standard weeks.  At week 51 there are 5 weeks of benefits that can still be paid at the 55% benefit rate.\nAs the claimant is being paid extended parental benefits at week 51, it needs to be determined how many weeks of extended parental benefits would be equivalent to five standard weeks of benefits in order to determine the benefit period extension.  Using  the table found in Annex 2,  the 5 standard weeks are converted to 8 weeks of extended parental benefits. The benefit period is extended by 8 weeks to allow for the additional weeks to be paid. \nExample 3:\nA claimant applies for extended parental benefits and receives 35 weeks of extended parental benefits.  She then converts her claim to regular benefits and receives 5 weeks of regular benefits.  The claimant then returns to work for 5 weeks at which point she renews her claim for regular benefits.  As weeks in which the claimant returns to work are deemed weeks paid for the purposes of calculating the 50 week cap, the claimant reaches 50 weeks paid or deemed paid after receiving five more weeks of regular benefits.\nAt week 51, using the table found in Annex 1,  the 35 weeks of extended parental benefits paid in the initial benefit period are converted to 21 weeks standard parental benefits.  In order to determine how many weeks at the 55% benefit rate can still be paid within the 50 week cap, 21 weeks of converted parental benefits, 10 weeks of regular benefits and 5 weeks during which the claimant returned to work must be subtracted from the cap of 50 standard weeks.

However, an individual claiming parental benefits is not expected to cease all regular activity and simply remain at home to care for the child. As long as the parent is providing for the needs of the child, it is acceptable to attend a course of instruction or other employment activity while in receipt of parental benefits, as availability is not a factor in determining entitlement to receive parental benefits. The individual can still be considered to be taking care of their child when she/he does so outside the hours of this other activity. However when the claimant's reason for not working is not, or ceases to be, to care for the child, entitlement to parental benefits is not proven and the claimant may be subject to a disentitlement   . The circumstances of each case must be considered individually.\nThere are situations where it may be determined that a claimant is not meeting the condition of caring for the child. An example of this would be where a father leaves the child with the mother in Ottawa and moves to Vancouver to attend a course, thereby not seeing the child for months.

The Commission has always maintained that benefits are not payable to teachers during any non-teaching periods.\nIn 1980, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that teachers are only paid for the days they teach (S.C.C. 15540, 1980, FCA A-267-77). The Court also found that teachers have an interruption of earnings and a separation from employment during non-teaching periods. Consequently, earnings can only be allocated to days that a teacher actually teaches.\nTo maintain the original intent not to pay regular benefits during non-teaching periods, to claimants who are engaged in the occupation of teaching a regulation was introduced, limiting entitlement to EI benefits to very specific situations (EIR 33). The regulation providing for the payment of maternity, parental, compassionate care and family caregiver benefits during the non-teaching period also provides that certain conditions must be met before regular and sickness benefits can be paid during any non-teaching periods.\nThis chapter and the accompanying annexes are intended to clarify the entitlement to EI benefits, of teachers during these non-teaching periods. Teachers' entitlement during the teaching period is subject to the same entitlement conditions of claimants in any other occupation. The legislative provisions in relation to what constitutes a week of unemployment (Digest Chapter 4), and to a claimant's availability for work (Digest Chapter 10) also apply.

Normally, the school year goes from September to June, with July and August as the main break time for teachers. During the school year from September to June, other breaks for teachers are usually the Christmas break and the spring break.

If a teacher is not working during a break period, they might not be eligible for employment insurance benefits. The rules about benefits during non-teaching periods are different from the rules for teaching periods. More information on this can be found in Chapter 4 and Chapter 10.

Statutory holidays are not considered non-teaching periods by themselves. But if a holiday falls during a break, like Easter Monday during spring break, it is part of the break period.

The regulations only apply when a significant number of teachers are not working. Break times can vary among provinces and even between schools in the same area. For example, a private school might have a different spring break than a public school nearby, but both breaks are still considered non-teaching periods.

The main point is to see if a noticeable number of teachers are not at work during a specific time. If there's no big difference in the number of teachers working compared to other times, then it might not be considered a non-teaching period.

However, the spring break for the private school is still considered a non-teaching period.\nThe test is whether it can be determined that a significant number of the claimant's teacher colleagues are not at work during a specific period. This criterion will not be met where there is no noticeable difference in the number of people teaching during specific periods of the year, compared to other periods.\nWhere year-round schooling exists, the year is usually divided into 4 instructional periods of roughly equal duration, separated by breaks.

It is reasonable to conclude that a new contract exists when the employer has made a bona fide offer of employment to teach in the next teaching period (in other words, the employer had a vacant teaching position to be filled during the next teaching period), and the teacher accepted the offer. A simple expectation of a job offer is not considered a genuine offer of employment. For example, an invitation to a general recruitment session during the summer non-teaching period does not constitute a genuine offer of employment, even though there is a strong possibility that a teacher will be offered a teaching contract for the next school year.\nWhere a teacher verbally accepts an offer of employment, a delay in signing the contract until a later date during the non-teaching period does not negate the fact that a contract for teaching has been concluded. In this case, it is considered that the teacher has a new contract as of the date the offer was made by the employer and verbally accepted by the teacher.\nThe contract can be for full-time teaching, for a few days each week, or even a few hours each day (CUB 70467; FCA A-511-95, CUB 28420).

1. Did the teacher agree to teach again before their current contract ended? If not, and there's no new agreement to teach, then the teacher's contract has ended. They can start receiving benefits the day after their contract ended.
2. If a new contract is signed or agreed upon during the non-teaching time, and benefits were given for that time, then benefits might stop when the new contract is signed. This is based on certain connections between the two contracts.
If the teacher has a new contract to teach again, whether agreed before or after their previous contract ended, we need to look at a second factor.",81.63000000000002,5.600000000000001,8.548686976883017,8.4,7.0138,8.373066666666663,36.333333333333336,3.2,0.6345834301577674,0.6291938940994442,2.4010750119445774,0.8307265547761166,0.4643512767425811,0.0606646612164255,4.446666666666666,4.0,2.296480398832575,15.0,12.5,8.414273587185052,1.3,1.0,0.5744562646538028,150,79,0.5266666666666666,692,10,14.3.1.2,Continuity of employment,Chapter 14 - Teachers,"To conclude that a contract for teaching has terminated, there must be an absolute break in the teacher's employment. This question usually arises during the summer months (FCA A-811-00, CUB 49720; FCA A-664-01, CUB 49701). To determine whether there is an absolute break in the continuity of the teacher's employment during a non-teaching period and therefore conclude that the contract has terminated, 2 factors must be considered.\nThe first factor relates to whether, before the end of the current contract, the teacher has  entered into a new contract or come to a verbal agreement to return to teaching at the end of the non-teaching period (FCA A-261-05, CUB 63467; FCA A-151-01, CUB 50649). If there is no new contract or verbal agreement to return to teaching, then there is an absolute break in the teacher's employment at the end of the current contract. The claimant will then be entitled to benefits from the day following the last day under contract.\nHowever, where a contract for the next teaching period is signed or verbally agreed to during the non-teaching period, and benefits had been allowed for the non-teaching period, a disentitlement under EIR 33 will apply as of the date of the signature of the contract or verbal agreement, if it is established that linkages exist (Refer to second factor).\nWhere the teacher has a new contract or agreement to return to teaching at the end of the non-teaching period, whether it was accepted prior to or after the end of their previous contract, a  second factor must be examined.",0.99900144
810,810,810,"The second factor to consider is whether there are connections between different work contracts. Finding links between contracts can help determine if the employer-employee relationship continues after the first contract ends. If a teacher is hired again or agrees to return to teaching after a break, it may indicate a continuity in their job. The Commission looks for other factors that show a connection between the contracts, even if a new contract is signed before the previous one ends.

The Commission can't just use repeated contracts to stop a teacher from getting benefits for a break from teaching. They need more proof that the contracts are related and still connected.

Things like carrying over seniority, pension contributions, sick leave credits, or getting insurance coverage over the summer can show a connection between contracts. Benefits like medical or dental coverage could continue after a contract ends based on union agreements, but if the employer continues providing these benefits, it counts as a connection.

If a teacher signs a new contract before the old one ends and there are links between them, benefits might not be given for the break since it's seen as continuous employment. If a new contract is signed after the old one ends but connections between contracts are found, benefits might not be given starting from when the new contract is signed.

A teacher with contracts from different school boards must end all contracts before getting benefits during a break. If a teacher stays with the same employer, it's usually seen as continuing employment even if they change schools. In some places, a teacher can switch to a different school district and still keep benefits like medical or dental coverage from their previous contract. To determine if there is continuing employment between different school boards, provincial agreements and school district agreements need to be checked.

Just because a teacher isn't working doesn't mean their teaching contract has ended. This can include times when a teacher is on a break, like sick leave, maternity leave, or any approved type of leave. As long as the contract is valid, a teacher follows the rules even during a break from teaching.",61.08756509161043,10.08734490517519,12.926379034027164,14.076245580199291,12.83323047251688,12.16087431693989,52.676952748312445,6.705882352941177,0.8705027513206005,0.8656892736752828,2.732060256851278,0.4358129003387774,0.4554649149153793,0.0633035831170774,4.989071038251367,5.0,2.6374542101808256,21.529411764705884,22.0,5.740646070002755,1.46448087431694,1.0,0.7374417664628345,366,153,0.4180327868852459,1873,17,14.3.1.3,Linkages between contracts,Chapter 14 - Teachers,"The second factor is to determine whether linkages exist between the contracts. The determination of the existence of linkages between contracts will assist in confirming whether there has been a complete severance of the employer-employee relationship at the end of the first contract. If the teacher is rehired or an agreement is made to return to teaching after the non-teaching period, there may be continuity in the teacher's employment (FCA A-151-16; FCA A-510-14; FCA A-101-98, CUB 40255). Even if the new contract is signed or agreed to verbally prior to the end of the previous contract, the Commission must look for other elements of continuity or linkages between the 2 contracts, before imposing a disentitlement.\nThe Commission cannot simply rely on the existence of repetitive contracts to disentitle a teacher for the non-teaching period. There must be additional evidence of contract linkages and continuing attachment to the previous contract.\nElements to take into consideration when determining whether there was an absolute break in the continuity of a teacher's employment could include linkages such as:\n\nthe carry forward of seniority from one contract year to the next;\nthe carry forward of pension contributions from one contract year to the next;\nretention of sick leave credits from one contract year to the next;\ngroup insurance premiums paid by the employer over the summer period;\naccess to group insurance plans during the non-teaching period (FCA A-367-04, CUB 60821).\nUnder the terms and conditions of a collective agreement, employee benefits, such as medical and dental benefits, could continue after termination. Some teachers may maintain medical and dental coverage through their union after termination, for which premiums may be paid by either the employee or the union. These benefits, on their own, do not equate to linkages. However, if medical or dental benefits are continued through the employer, then these are considered linkages.\nIf a contract for the next teaching period was signed, or a verbal agreement was reached before the end of the current contract, and linkages exist between contracts, a disentitlement will be imposed from the start of the non-teaching period because it is considered that the contract in teaching has not terminated. If a new contract is signed or a verbal agreement is reached after the end of a previous contract and linkages exist between the 2 contracts, a disentitlement will be imposed from the date the new contract is signed or the agreement is reached. Both factors, the existence of a contract/verbal agreement and linkages, must be present to support a disentitlement.\nWhere a teacher is employed under separate contracts with 1 or more school boards, all contracts must terminate before the teacher can be entitled to benefits during any non-teaching period.\nA finding that continuity of employment exists, normally results when the employment is with the same employer or school board, even if the teaching location or school has changed. In some provinces, however, a teacher can accept a contract from a different school district for the following school year and carry over such benefits as medical or dental, or accumulated sick leave from their previous contract. In these situations, the details of the provincial agreements, as well as the agreements of the different school boards or districts must be examined to correctly determine whether there is continuity of employment between one school board/district and another.\nThe fact that a teacher is not working, does not mean that a contract of employment in teaching has terminated. This may include when a teacher is suspended, on an approved leave of absence with or without pay (CUB 65820), on educational leave, sabbatical leave, sick leave (CUB 73507; FCA A-80-95, CUB26698), maternity leave, or any type of leave, including deferred salary or self-funded leave (FCA A-676-93; CUB 23386). As long as the contract is valid, a teacher is subject to the regulation during any non-teaching period (CUB 68435; FCA A-681-90, CUB 14246A).",0.99524903
811,811,811,"As per EIR 33(2)(b), a teacher may get benefits if all their teaching work during a certain time was on a casual or substitute basis. Casual employment means irregular or temporary work with no set pattern, usually filling in for another teacher briefly. Substitute employment happens when a teacher replaces another temporarily due to leave or illness. But if a substitute teacher's position becomes regular, they are no longer considered a substitute.

To be exempt from losing benefits during non-teaching periods, a teacher must have worked entirely as a casual or substitute teacher within the specified time. Like, if a teacher worked as a substitute but then signs a regular teaching contract, they won't qualify for the benefit exemption. If a teacher doesnâ€™t meet the casual or substitute criteria, another provision applies.

One situation is where a teacher worked as a substitute or casual teacher, and then signs a new contract to teach again in the future. In this case, the teacher won't lose benefits during non-teaching times. If a teacher meets all the conditions under EIR 33(2)(a) and (b), they are exempt from losing benefits for the whole benefit period once they qualify.

There are cases where teachers sign annual contracts for substitute teaching positions. Despite being called substitutes under their contract, they are not exempt from losing benefits unless their contract ends. If a teacher had both casual/substitute work and an ongoing contract at the end of the school year, benefits are withheld until proof of contract termination is provided. Teachers under part-time or lesson-based contracts throughout a school year aren't considered casual or substitute.",51.648913043478274,10.952919254658386,13.707050652182112,14.842236024844722,12.06246894409938,12.205072463768117,52.32298136645963,6.428571428571429,0.8427827725043664,0.845106249054273,2.8619970009541964,0.4375607721557607,0.4270481744088269,0.0559720562880075,5.018115942028985,5.0,2.645004465825834,19.714285714285715,18.0,5.611576954686387,1.5978260869565215,1.0,0.8128467947794583,276,134,0.4855072463768116,1431,14,14.3.2,Teaching on a casual or substitute basis,Chapter 14 - Teachers,"Pursuant to EIR 33(2)(b), a teacher may be entitled to benefits if all of their employment in teaching during their qualifying period was on a casual or substitute basis.\nThe words casual or substitute must be given their usual dictionary meaning. This general interpretation may differ from particular definitions found either in provincial legislation or in labour agreements.\nEmployment on a casual basis refers to employment that is not regular or permanent, but is temporary or occasional. The teacher is generally on-call, with no set pattern of work, to perform the duties of another teacher for a short duration, and not in a continuous or predetermined way. If the employment involves filling an unexpected or temporary absence for a short period, and if the replacement of the absent teacher can end at any time without notice, the replacement is of a casual nature, for the purpose of applying the regulation.\nEmployment on a substitute basis occurs when a teacher replaces another teacher on a temporary basis, for instance during a leave of absence, vacations or illness. However, if the teacher's employment as a substitute becomes fixed or regular, or subject to a temporary full time or part time contract, regardless of the terms of that teaching contract, whether for a few days each week or a few hours each day, the employment can no longer be considered as substitute.\nA teacher cannot benefit from the exception in the regulation based solely on their status of casual or substitute given by the school board, or under the terms of the collective agreement. The exception in the regulation emphasizes the performance of the employment and not the status of the teacher who holds it (FCA A-103-06, CUB 65192).\nFor example, a teacher may have a casual or substitute status but during the qualifying period, enter into a contract that is not on a casual or substitute basis, but is on a regular full time or part time basis. In this situation, the teacher cannot benefit from the exception in the regulation since not all of the employment in the qualifying period was held on a casual or substitute basis.\nFor the purpose of the exempting condition in EIR 33(2)(b), all of the teaching employment in the qualifying period must have been on a casual or substitute basis. Once a casual or substitute teacher signs a contract for teaching, regardless of the terms of that teaching contract, the employment no longer falls under the category of casual or substitute. If a teacher has met the condition that all of their teaching employment in their qualifying period was on a casual or substitute basis, they will be exempt from a disentitlement for all non-teaching periods during the corresponding benefit period.\nA teacher who does not meet the definition of casual or substitute teacher falls under the provisions of EIR 33(2)(a). Therefore, the guidelines set out in section 14.3.1 of this chapter apply. That teacher will be relieved from disentitlement when their contract terminates or if they qualify to receive benefits with respect to employment in an occupation other than teaching.\nThere may be situations where a teacher was employed on a casual or a substitute basis and no contract existed for the school year that just ended, but a contract is signed or agreed to for an upcoming teaching period. That teacher would not be subject to a disentitlement for any non-teaching periods. In this situation, the claimant will have met both of the conditions set out in EIR 33(2)(a) and (b) for the current non-teaching period. The teacher would also be exempt from disentitlement during any other non-teaching period during their benefit period, as once the condition in EIR 33(2)(b) is met, it is considered to be met for the entire benefit period. The claimant could, however, be subject to disentitlement under other sections of the act and regulations.\nThere are situations where claimants hired as substitute or replacement teachers year after year sign 10-month contracts each year for these positions. In these cases, the claimant is a teacher under a contract, regardless of the fact that it is a contract as a replacement teacher, or that, for the purpose of their collective agreement, they are referred to as a substitute teacher by their employer. These teachers are disentitled from benefits unless the relieving condition of contract termination is met (EIR 33(2)(a); FCA A-151-01, CUB 50649).\nTherefore, when a claimant had teaching employment during their qualifying period both on a casual or substitute basis, and under a contract that was still in place at the end of the school year, a disentitlement is imposed, until it is proven that the contract has terminated as defined in section 14.3.1 of this chapter.\nThere may be situations where a teacher is hired under a contract that could be terminated at any time, to teach part time or by the lesson, for the full school year. These teachers are still under contract during the non-teaching periods that fall within their contract period, as a contract to teach part time or by the lesson is not casual or substitute teaching.

Generally, teachers are paid for days between September and June, except summer months when they aren't paid. If a teacher's contract includes pay for holidays or other non-teaching days, they will get paid for those too. 

For example, if a teacher is paid for holidays and files a claim during a break, they will be paid for those days. But if they are only paid for some holidays, they will only get paid for those specific days.

As a result, the Commission did not allocate earnings during any non-teaching days.\nHowever, in a later decision, the Federal Court ruled that the allocation of a teacher's salary must be done in accordance with existing regulations (FCA A-113-98, CUB 40009). This would be the case when the contract specifies that, during the period of employment, a teacher is paid for days other than teaching days, such as statutory holidays, non-working and vacation days (currently EIR 36(5)). In that decision, it was considered that the entire teaching period was being remunerated, thus allowing for the allocation of earnings for non-teaching days, pursuant to the regulation.\nThis means that earnings of a teacher can be allocated, not only to teaching days, but also to any other non-teaching days, as specified in the contract. A strict application of the Federal Court decision would have prevented the Commission from paying maternity, parental, compassionate care or family caregiver benefits during non-teaching periods, to teachers in similar situations. To respect the intent of the legislation and to strike a balance between the Supreme Court decision and the subsequent Federal Court decision, earnings are not allocated during the summer non-teaching period. As such regular, maternity, parental, compassionate care or family caregiver benefits can be paid during that period, regardless of whether the claimant accumulates insurable hours and/or earnings under their teaching contract for the summer non-teaching period.\nIf it is stipulated in the teaching contract, that a teacher is paid for statutory holidays and/or other days, in addition to teaching days, the Commission's policy is to allocate earnings to all teaching and non-teaching days that fall in the teaching period (generally September to June) including the Christmas and spring break non-teaching periods. This means that generally, no earnings will be allocated in the summer non-teaching period (usually July and August).\nIf the contract specifies that the teacher is paid for the entire teaching period, as was the case in the Federal Court decision mentioned above, allocation will be done proportionately over the entire teaching period, pursuant to EIR 36(5).\nIf, however, the contract specifies that only certain non-teaching days are remunerated (for example only statutory holidays) monies paid for these non-teaching days will be allocated under the appropriate subsection, that is, statutory holidays would be allocated under EIR 36(13) and  vacation pay under EIR 36(8). No monies would be allocated outside the teaching period.\nExample: If a teacher files a claim during the Christmas break and the contract specifies that the teacher is paid for the statutory holidays as well as vacation days while the school is closed, thereby providing remuneration for the entire teaching period, the allocation of the total remuneration is made under EIR 36(5).\nIf a contract specifies that a teacher is only paid for statutory holidays, and the teacher files a claim during the Christmas break, statutory holiday pay is allocated to Christmas day, Boxing day and New Year's day, pursuant to EIR 36(13), as not all of the non-working days in the teaching period are remunerated.\nAs no earnings are allocated outside the period of teaching, (usually July and August) there would be no earnings allocated to the summer period and an interruption of earnings would occur. This policy maintains the current approach for the payment of maternity, parental, compassionate care and family caregiver benefits for teachers during the non-teaching period.\nIt is important to note that EIR 33 must still be applied to all traditional non-teaching periods, to determine entitlement to benefits for a teacher who remains under a teaching contract.\nThe intent is to allow for the payment of maternity, parental, compassionate care or family caregiver benefits during the non-teaching period. Therefore, the Commission's policy is to pay these types of special benefits during the summer non-teaching period, even if the client is accumulating insurable hours during that period.",0.9972984
817,817,817,"If a teacher works during the summer break when they are not teaching, the money they earn during this time doesn't usually affect their unemployment benefits. This means they could still get paid benefits. But if the teacher applies for benefits again later on, the government will check their work history to see how many hours they worked and how much they earned during the non-teaching period in the summer.
 
If the teacher wants to use these hours to qualify for benefits in the future, their earnings will be considered. For example, if a teacher needs 600 hours to get benefits and only 560 hours are from teaching, then 40 hours from the non-teaching period could be used. Any more hours from the non-teaching period would only count if the teacher asks for them to be included.",71.98250000000002,9.0572695035461,9.725611199111238,11.669503546099293,11.56510638297872,9.462978723404252,41.23049645390071,4.166666666666667,0.8870765924453735,0.8988571614027023,2.9348411221834265,0.4071468269793925,0.442644131248,0.0845862282197138,4.51063829787234,4.0,2.016305944914564,23.5,23.0,9.233092656309694,1.3120567375886525,1.0,0.5970940476552961,141,76,0.5390070921985816,652,6,14.6.2,Insurable hours during non-teaching period,Chapter 14 - Teachers,"Generally, a claimant who accumulates hours of insurable employment while receiving EI benefits would have the earnings from those hours deducted from their benefits. However, as previously mentioned, in the case of a teacher who is paid for days other than teaching days, they may accumulate insurable hours during the summer non-teaching period, while no allocation of earnings is made for that period. This will allow EI benefits to be paid. To avoid situations where a teacher is paid benefits for the summer non-teaching period and, on a subsequent claim, receives credit for the insurable hours accumulated during that same period, the following applies:\n\nif a teacher files a subsequent claim after having received benefits in the non-teaching period, the record of employment will be reviewed to determine the number of insured hours and amount of earnings that fell in the non-teaching period\na determination will be made as to whether the teacher could qualify to establish the subsequent claim without the insured hours from the non-teaching period\nif a teacher requests or requires credit for the insurable hours during the summer non-teaching period, an allocation of earnings will be done for the non-teaching period, pursuant to EIR 36(5) (FCA A-113-98, CUB 40009)\nif a teacher does not require all the insured hours during the non-teaching period, the allocation of earnings would only cover the hours needed for the subsequent claim. For example, if a teacher required 600 hours to qualify for benefits and only 560 hours fell in the teaching period only 40 hours from the non-teaching period would be used, and insured earnings would be allocated to the period covered by those hours. The balance of the hours from the non-teaching period would not be used in the calculation of the claim unless the teacher requested credit for all of those insured hours.

827,827,827,"In order to be considered for benefits and tax purposes as a fisherman, it's important to inform the buyer, who is usually seen as the employer, about who took part in catching and how the earnings are divided. This involves providing details about catches sold and sharing arrangements among the participants. The fisherman's share of the catch proceeds is considered as insurable earnings. Boat owners or lessees can deduct shares, wages, salaries, and 25% of the sales value. There is no specific minimum income each week.

For earnings to count towards benefits, they need to be from catches made in a specific period. If the catch is fresh, earnings are divided daily across the fishing trip days. If it's preserved, earnings are counted on the delivery week. When the trip overlaps the qualifying period, only the earnings from the days falling in the period are considered.

To calculate the benefit rate, fishing earnings within the period are added to other employment earnings, then divided by a specific number based on the regional unemployment rate. Earnings from non-fishing jobs are converted to weekly amounts using the same number and added to the fishing earnings. Rates are affected if the fisherman left a job voluntarily or was fired for misconduct.

The benefit period considers the most recent 26 weeks of continuous employment before the fishing benefit claim. The total weekly earnings from all jobs are used to determine the benefit rate, which is then multiplied by 55%.

To re-qualify, the claimant must have accumulated, since the date of event, either the amount of insurable earnings in fishing employment that is required to qualify for fishing benefits or the number of insurable hours in non-fishing employment that is required to qualify for regular non-fishing benefits.\nA previous indefinite disqualification on a regular non-fishing claim does not prevent the establishment of a fishing claim where the claimant has accumulated the amount of fishing insurable earnings required to qualify for a fishing claim and could not re-qualify on a regular non-fishing claim. The previous regular claim must then be cancelled or terminated. This situation is the only situation where a regular claim can be terminated in order to establish a fishing claim.\nDisentitlements may be imposed on fishing claims when entitlement conditions are not met, for example, a fisher has not proven that they were available for fishing-related employment while attending school full-time   . Other entitlement conditions include the requirement to remain unemployed from non-fishing employment, participate in any referred training programs as required, remain in Canada, etc. For details with respect to entitlement conditions given particular situations when in receipt of fishing (regular or special) benefits, refer to the main subject chapters in this document   .",0.99873227

- having enough work hours to qualify for benefits 
- meeting specific criteria for having fewer than 910 work hours in a certain period 
- meeting conditions for special benefits 
- meeting criteria to extend the benefit period 
- having earnings to calculate benefit amount 
- calculating benefits according to set rules, including extending the calculation time 
- correcting mistakes in employment records that affect the issues mentioned above 
- determining a family supplement rate

- how earnings are divided 
- time spent in jail 
- time out of the country 
- being self-employed 
- not being available for work 
- reasons for separation

In extreme cases, the legislation allows the Commission to prosecute in court.\nThe Employment Insurance Act (EIA) specifies the actions that constitute misrepresentation and for which the Commission may impose a penalty.

It's also meant to make sure that no one benefits from or repeats actions that could lead to illegal payments. Penalties are usually related to overpayments of benefits, but they can also be given even if there was no overpayment. The Commission checks for false information to decide if a penalty should be given. The penalty can be given to the person who provided false information or the employer, or someone representing them. 

Penalties can be a warning, a fine, or a legal judgment. Only one type of penalty can be given for each case of providing false information. If a warning is given, it can also come with a violation notice. If there are repeated cases of breaking the rules, the penalties become more serious. 

Deciding to give a penalty is up to the Commission, and they must think carefully about all the facts before deciding on what the penalty should be.

A penalty is meant to be a deterrent and to ensure individuals and employers neither benefit from nor repeat actions that risk the illegal payment of benefits   . Penalties are linked to overpayments, but can be imposed in situations when there is no overpayment. The Commission tests for misrepresentation to determine whether a penalty is applicable. The penalty applies to the individual or corporation responsible for the misrepresentation, and may be imposed on:\n\nthe claimant;\na person representing the claimant;\nthe employer; or\na person representing the employer.\n\nA penalty can be:\n\nnon-monetary, in the form of a warning letter;\nmonetary, calculated in accordance with the provisions of the legislation and the policy contained in this chapter; or\nthe judgment rendered as a result of formal prosecution.\n\nOnly one kind of penalty can be imposed on a party for any one act of misrepresentation. For example, the Commission cannot first prosecute and later impose a warning letter for the same infraction. Similarly, the Commission cannot impose a warning letter and later decide to prosecute the same infraction.\nWhen a monetary or non-monetary sanction is imposed, the Commission may also issue a violation. When a warning letter is issued, if a violation is also issued, it is considered an unclassified violation   . When there is a second, third or greater incident of penalty, and a violation is also issued, the violation is classified as subsequent. Otherwise, violations are coded based on the value of the net overpayment   . In each case, except for an unclassified violation, the claimant will need additional hours to qualify for benefits over the next 260 weeks (5 years) or two subsequent claims. Violations and penalties are progressive; a subsequent infraction results in a more severe consequence.\nFinally, the decisions to impose a penalty or violation are discretionary and their consideration rests solely with the Commission. The Commission must exercise its discretion judiciously   . This means the Commission must take into account all relevant and ignore all irrelevant considerations and tailor the penalty to address the specific situation of the individual receiving the penalty. The written decision must identify what information was considered and why it was important or irrelevant in setting the final penalty amount and deciding to issue a violation.",0.9588802

885,885,885,"When information in a file doesn't match up, the Commission needs to carefully review all the details to figure out if the differences can be explained. For example, two people might describe the same events but have different interpretations. The Commission has to decide what is factually true and what comes from personal views. If there's no way to resolve the differences between statements or sets of facts, the Commission has to decide which version seems more believable.

To prove someone misrepresented something, the evidence needs to show that one conclusion is more likely than another after looking at all the facts. For instance, if there's a 51% chance of snow and a 49% chance of clear skies, it's more probable it will snow, even if the chance is just slightly more. When deciding on a penalty, the Commission must prove that the evidence leans towards misrepresentation. Just not believing a person's claim of innocence isn't enough; the adjudicator has to point out evidence that goes against the person's statement.

For a false statement to be proven, it must meet certain criteria: it must be objectively false, deceive the Commission, lead to the person receiving benefits they aren't entitled to, and the person must have knowingly made the false statement. Deciding if there was misrepresentation is a choice that the Commission needs to back up with reasons. If a fact is important, there should be a clear explanation of why. Likewise, if a fact isn't relevant, there should be a reason for that too.

People might admit to misrepresentation but offer reasons for why they felt they had no other option but to lie. This is considered a mitigating circumstance.

The Commission must decide which evidence is objectively true and which evidence results from interpretation and understanding. When there is no way to resolve the contradictions between 2 or more statements or bank of facts, the Commission must decide if one version of events is more believable than another.\nThe standard of proof in establishing misrepresentation is the balance of probabilities   . A balance of probabilities means that, when all the facts are examined, one conclusion is more likely than the other   . For example, if the likelihood of snow is 51% and the likelihood of clear skies is 49%, then it is more likely it will snow, even though the difference in likelihood is very low. When considering a penalty, the Commission must establish that the evidence more likely concludes misrepresentation than not   .

This is called a mitigating circumstance and is discussed in greater detail in 18.5.2.

Under this policy a voluntary disclosure is a person's admission that he or she knowingly made a false statement or misrepresentation.,0.999637
889,889,889,"A voluntary disclosure needs to meet two conditions: the admission must be genuine and there should be no ongoing investigation related to the disclosure, and the misconduct would have led to a penalty, warning, or prosecution if there hadn't been a voluntary disclosure.

A genuine admission means that the responsible person is coming forward to correct a mistake. For example, someone might have received benefits incorrectly due to wrong information given, and they admit it to rectify the situation. If there is an investigation already happening, it raises doubts about the sincerity of the disclosure. Therefore, for a disclosure to be considered voluntary, there should not be any ongoing investigation related to it. It is also crucial to understand that if information is shared to gain some benefit, it won't be seen as a voluntary disclosure.

The second condition is that the initial information provided should be a misrepresentation that would attract a penalty if the voluntary disclosure option was not available. For instance, if someone reveals that they did not declare vacation pay while claiming other earnings, this act would usually invite a penalty. But because the person came forward without any prompting, no penalty is given in this case.

The Commission does not penalize individuals who make voluntary disclosures. This means there are no fines, warnings, violations, interest charges, or repetitive misrepresentation recordings. The Commission will confirm in writing if a disclosure meets the standards of their policy.

Voluntary disclosures have no time restrictions, and there is no limit to how many times someone can use this option. Any disclosure meeting the policy requirements will not face penalties or violations.

It's important to note that any overpayment resulting from a voluntary disclosure cannot be canceled. As it is caused by false information, it does not fulfill the conditions for write-off under EIR 56.",50.109807692307726,11.114358974358977,14.283593685282176,15.620512820512822,12.745576923076923,13.17512820512821,53.47435897435898,6.625,0.8459917624791463,0.8705539107322693,2.77594412941791,0.6932978529404702,0.4409434063850666,0.0585436559321064,5.185897435897436,4.0,3.1466394104225217,19.5,17.5,7.524958471646205,1.6185897435897436,1.0,0.9766704616522592,312,158,0.5064102564102564,1662,16,18.3.4.1,Voluntary disclosure policy,Chapter 18 - Policy on penalties,"A voluntary disclosure must meet 2 conditions:\n\nthe admission must be authentic and there must be no investigation initiated or underway in relation to the voluntary disclosure, and\nthe offence would have resulted in a penalty, a warning letter or prosecution had there been no voluntary disclosure\n\nAn authentic admission means that the responsible party comes forward with the sole purpose of righting a wrong. He or she is aware that misinformation resulted in an inappropriate payment of benefits, and submits information to correct the situation. If any investigation is underway, it raises a question as to whether the disclosure is given freely or presented in an attempt to avoid the consequence of an investigation. Therefore, a finding of voluntary disclosure also depends on the absence of an investigation initiated or underway in relation to the voluntary disclosure. As well, case law confirms that when information is submitted for the purpose of gaining a benefit, it is not a voluntary disclosure. For example, the following would not be considered a voluntary disclosure:\nA claimant works while on claim but does not declare the work or earnings on their claimant report. The claim ends and the claimant submits the Record of Employment from the undeclared work to establish a new claim. The claimant advises they did not declare the work and earnings previously.\nIn this case, the claimant does not submit the ROE for the purpose of correcting the undeclared earnings. The claimant submits the ROE to obtain Employment Insurance benefits. This is not considered an authentic voluntary disclosure.\nThe second condition is that the original information must constitute a misrepresentation for which a penalty would be imposed if the Voluntary Disclosure Policy did not exist.\nFor example, if a person voluntarily discloses a deliberate failure to declare vacation pay with other earnings on a claimant report, the Commission would normally impose a penalty for failing to declare earnings. Because the claimant came forward without other considerations, no penalty is imposed. This differs from an error correction, discussed below.\nThe Commission does not impose a penalty when the voluntary disclosure policy is applied   . This means there is no monetary penalty, no warning letter, no violation, no interest charged on the debt arising from the overpayment and the misrepresentation is not used to determine if a repetitive misrepresentation occurs. The Commission provides a written notification when a disclosure is found to meet the conditions of the Voluntary Disclosure Policy.\nThere is no time restriction on voluntary disclosure. There are no limits on the number of times a claimant, employer or third party may take advantage of the voluntary disclosure policy. Any disclosure that meets the policy requirements will not be penalized and no violation will be recorded.\n Please note: An overpayment arising from a voluntary disclosure cannot be written off.

The Commission can review a benefit claim and decide that too much money was received without necessarily saying there was a deliberate lie. But for a penalty to be issued, the person who applied for benefits had to have either tried to get money they weren't supposed to or actually received money through deception. Unlike deciding if someone should get benefits or not, giving a penalty involves looking at what the person knew and what was in the paperwork.

A penalty can be given to the person applying for benefits, their employer, or someone helping them with their benefits claim if they:

- knowingly gave false information to the Commission, or
- left out important details on a form

However, a penalty can only exist if a claimant attempted to obtain or actually was paid benefits as a result of misrepresentation.

902,902,902,"When you cash a paper check instead of getting money directly deposited into your account, it means that you have accepted payment for your Employment Insurance benefits. The law allows the government to consider each paper check you cash as an act of lying about something, if they can prove that you knew you weren't supposed to get that money. 

But if you get your payments deposited straight into your account, that doesn't automatically mean you were lying. In that case, they can only penalize you if they can show that you knowingly kept money that you shouldn't have. 

The one-week waiting period before you start getting benefits doesn't count in these situations. The rules are very specific about when penalties can be given â€“ either for cashing a check you weren't supposed to or for keeping money from a direct deposit that you knew you shouldn't have. The number of penalties is based on the number of weeks you got paid when you weren't supposed to.

For example, if you say you lost your job for a reason that makes you eligible for benefits when you actually didn't, and you get paid based on that false information, the government can penalize you for each set of two-week payments you got after lying.

Under EIA 38(1)(e), the Commission can count every paper warrant that a claimant has accepted and cashed as 1 count of misrepresentation, as long as the facts show that the claimant understood that he or she had no right to receive that payment.\nAs a result of the Federal Court of Appeal (FCA) decision A-1-09 - Canada v Tamber, EI payments made through direct deposit do not imply the negotiation of warrants. Therefore, to count a direct deposit as 1 count of misrepresentation, the Commission must instead impose a penalty under EIA 38(1)(f) on the basis that the claimant knowingly failed to return amounts paid to which there was no entitlement.\nThe 1 week waiting period cannot be included in this count. EIA 38(1)(e) and 38(1)(f) are specific in their application: a penalty may be imposed for negotiating a warrant  or failing to return a direct deposit payment for benefits to which the claimant knew there was no entitlement. Otherwise, the technical count of misrepresentation can be assessed based on the number of 1or 2 week payments that processed through the computer pay system. Even if there is a single payment issued for multiple weeks, that single payment is an administrative convenience. The entitlement to those moneys is based on 1 or 2 week increments. \nAs an example:\n\na claimant renews a claim and declares that a loss of employment did not arise from quitting or dismissal. The claimant is paid based on that false information. If the adjudicator retroactively disqualifies the claim and determines the claimant made the misrepresentation knowing that an accurate statement would prevent payment of benefits, the adjudicator may also conclude that the claimant knew there was no entitlement to the subsequent benefits paid. Therefore, the adjudicator may impose a penalty for every 2 week declaration that resulted in a paper warrant or electronic deposit accepted and not returned after the false statement was knowingly made\nNote: The Commission does not impose 2 penalties when a claimant both submits a claimant report and negotiates/accepts the payment for the same 2 week period. Although the act of submitting false information and the act of negotiating the payment are 2 separate acts, they are in respect of the same 2 week period.",0.98734933

Case law says the Commission bears the responsibility to prove an allegation of misrepresentation, and that the legal test is that, on a balance of probabilities, a false statement was knowingly made.\nWhen claimants complete their bi-weekly electronic reports, they are asked to acknowledge their responsibility to report any absence from Canada. The bi-weekly report asks claimants if they were outside Canada during the period of their report. Because of that question  and the  answer to that question,  the Commission can conclude that the claimant misrepresented the absence. If a conclusion of misrepresentation rests solely on the absence from Canada, a penalty will not be imposed unless the claimant admits to understanding he or she was not entitled to benefits during this period.\nClaimants who declare availability for work on their bi-weekly claimant report during their absence from Canada must prove they were available for work during that period   . The preamble to the claimant report draws a clear relationship between the ideas that being out of Canada means a claimant is not available. Claimants who maintain they remained available during an absence from Canada must prove this availability through an acceptable and credible written job search and evidence of their ability to work in the country in which work was sought, or of their ability to immediately return to Canada to accept an offer of employment.\nSimilarly, when a claimant is absent from Canada for a reason permitted under EIR 55(1), but was absent for longer than the definite periods allowed under EIR 55(1), availability must be carefully examined to determine if the claimant genuinely meets the requirements of the Act for all days of the absence.\nFinally, a determination that the claimant incorrectly declared availability during an absence from Canada does not automatically conclude misrepresentation. If the claimant's explanation for the false statement is credible, it will not meet the condition of knowingly; therefore a penalty shall not be imposed. Strong fact-finding and sound documentation in the final decision must support a finding of misrepresentation.

904,904,904,"A false Record of Employment (ROE) is when an ROE is issued even though there were no real hours worked or earnings. This can happen if a person never actually worked for the employer listed, the job wasn't one that could be insured, the ROE was made up with the employee's involvement, or if the ROE was stolen or bought.

The key point is that a false ROE is made when there wasn't a real employer-employee relationship. To prove this, it must be clear that at least one of the parties knew the ROE wasn't accurate. When looking into a false ROE case, it's important to carefully check all the facts. The person claiming benefits or the employer might have honestly thought that everything was in order. Any explanations given need to be looked at to see if they make sense and match the rest of the information.

Sometimes, a real employer-employee relationship existed and the employee did earn insurable hours and money, but false or misleading information was put on the ROE. This could be done to help the employee or the employer get more benefits, avoid disqualification, or lie about the reason for the job ending.

To prove this, there must be evidence that someone involved knew the information on the ROE was wrong. For any fake ROE situation, blame could fall on the person claiming benefits, the employer, or a representative. They could all face consequences for misrepresenting information.

Here is a breakdown of the maximum penalties:

- First lie: Up to $5,000
- Second lie: Up to $8,000
- Third lie or more: Up to $10,000

The penalty can't be more than the maximum allowed for that level of lie. The only thing that decides the maximum penalty is how many times someone has lied. For example, if someone lies the first time, the maximum penalty is $5,000.

If someone lies multiple times, the level of the lie can affect the penalty for the next time.

920,920,920,"The connection between what claimants report, the benefits they receive, and providing false information is carefully looked at. If a claimant gives wrong information on their application or Record of Employment, that's considered as misrepresentation. However, just reporting no work or earnings accurately is not seen as lying. The Employment Insurance Commission can decide that if a claimant gives false information, they know they are not entitled to benefits. Laws EIA 38(1)(e) and 38(1)(f) say that accepting and cashing benefit checks or keeping electronic deposits when not entitled to them is a crime that can lead to a penalty. The Commission doesn't count accurate claimant reports as misrepresentation. But every payment received, whether by check or electronic deposit, are seen as misrepresentation. 

Let's say a claimant says they lost their job due to lack of work on their application, changes their Record of Employment from quitting to being laid off, and submits three accurate reports stating no work or earnings, and gets paid three times. The application and altered Record of Employment are seen as misrepresentation. The accurate claimant reports are not. Keeping the three paper checks or not returning the electronic deposits is counted as three instances of misrepresentation. So, in total, it adds up to five misrepresentations. 

If a claimant reports accurately and no payment is issued, it's not counted as misrepresentation. But if false information is given, a penalty can be applied just for that.

A claimant may submit an ROE and application that constitute misrepresentation and claimant reports that accurately declare no work or earnings. Therefore, the simple submission of claimant reports cannot be considered misrepresentative. However, the Commission can reasonably conclude that claimants who file a claim with false information know they have no right to receive benefits. Under EIA 38(1)(e) and 38(1)(f), accepting and cashing a cheque for benefits or accepting then failing to return a benefit amount electronically deposited are both offences for which a penalty may be imposed. When counting incidents of misrepresentation, the Commission does not include any claimant reports submitted   . The Commission must include every payment whether paid by paper warrant or electronic deposit, as a misrepresentation.\nAs an example, a claimant submits:\n\nan application declaring a loss of employment due to shortage of work\na Record of Employment altered from a quit to a lay-off\n3 claimant reports accurately declaring no work and no earnings for which the claimant accepts 3 payments\n\nThe application and Record of Employment are 2 counts of misrepresentation. The claimant reports are not misrepresentation. Keeping each of the 3 paper warrants or failing to return the  electronic deposits constitutes 3 counts of misrepresentation. Therefore, the legal validation amount would be based on 5 counts of misrepresentation.\nAs long as the claimant report is accurately declared, the waiting period cannot be counted as misrepresentative because no warrant, or payment, was issued. However, if a claimant makes a false statement on the claimant report, a penalty may be considered for that false statement. Only 1 penalty can be assessed in respect of a claimant report period, whether it is considered because of misrepresentation on the claimant report or negotiating or failing to return the payment.",0.9976895
921,921,921,"When a claim is canceled, there is no legal benefit rate, so you can't calculate a net overpayment. This means you can't figure out the penalty based on a percentage of the overpayment like 50%, 100%, or 150%. Instead, for a canceled claim, the penalty is calculated based on a specific rule, EIA 38(2)(c).

In this situation, the penalty cannot be more than 3 times the highest benefit rate that was in place when the mistake happened for each misrepresentation. The policy follows the idea that penalties increase for repeated mistakes.

If someone keeps making the same mistake, the penalty goes up each time like this:
- For the first mistake, it's the highest rate times 100% times the number of mistakes.
- For the second mistake, it's the highest rate times 200% times the number of mistakes.
- For the third mistake, it's the highest rate times 300% times the number of mistakes.

The Commission also looks at any reasons that might make the situation less severe and can lower the penalty calculation by a certain percentage. For example, if the reasons lower the penalty by 30% for a first mistake, the calculation would be:
highest rate times 70% times the number of mistakes.

Since this is the first mistake, the final penalty calculation can't go over $5,000.

933,933,933,"Third parties can influence who needs to repay money owed due to an error and penalty. There are two main ways a third party can be involved:

1. A third party can work on behalf of a person making a claim or an employer, either with or without permission or awareness.
2. A third party can act on their own, improperly using someone else's information or identity.

Responsibility decides who is accountable for repaying any money owed and a penalty. If a third party acts without another person's or employer's knowledge or permission, they are responsible for any consequences. This could include things like identity theft or pretending to be an employer.

However, a third party may only be a messenger passing along information. For instance, a third party might help translate for someone who doesn't speak the language, or fill out a work record form on an employer's behalf. If the authorities find that the third party believed they were providing accurate information, they won't be held responsible for any debt or penalty. The person making the claim or the employer will be responsible for paying any money owed.

Since a third party is someone who acts on behalf of someone involved, the key factor is whether they acted with the knowledge and permission of the person involved, like the claimant or the employer.

For example, a third party may act as a translator for a claimant who has a language barrier, or complete a Record of Employment as directed by the employer. If the Commission determines the third party recorded the information, believing it was accurate, the third party cannot be held liable for any overpayment and is not subject to penalty. The claimant or employer is responsible for any debt incurred.\nBecause a third party can be defined as a person who acts on behalf of an interested party, the most important consideration is whether the third party acted with the consent and knowledge of the interested party - in this case, the claimant or the employer. Just as a finding of misrepresentation determines whether a penalty applies on a file, the finding that consent exists determines whether a third party is liable for an overpayment and subject to penalty.",0.9934924
934,934,934,"Consent can be given in two ways: express or implied. It can be limited to one specific thing, or it can cover a broader range of activities. Consent can come from the person making a claim, an employer, or a legal authority like the executor of an estate. According to Black's Law Dictionary, consent is when someone agrees to or gives permission for something, and it must be done willingly by a person who is capable of making decisions.

There are two types of consent: express consent, which is clearly stated, and implied consent, which is understood from someone's actions rather than their words. These definitions include three important parts: permission must be given, it must be given freely, and the person giving consent must be capable of understanding and making decisions.",60.934329573934846,10.267030075187972,11.538034831475386,12.776441102756891,12.17634085213033,10.982556390977448,49.98621553884712,6.166666666666667,0.8617724776268005,0.8326405882835388,2.8361846035339244,0.3109544699665145,0.4445426963466012,0.0724416422381327,4.7819548872180455,5.0,2.5674022032304964,22.166666666666668,23.0,7.243771270700243,1.4586466165413534,1.0,0.6883703998945322,133,77,0.5789473684210527,659,6,18.7.3,Consent,Chapter 18 - Policy on penalties,"Consent may be express or implied.

935,935,935,"An express consent means getting permission in a clear way. For a person making a claim, this can be shown through written permission, like a letter or a document that allows someone else to act on their behalf. The same goes for an employer â€“ express consent is usually shown through job duties laid out in writing.

If an employee's job includes handling payroll information that affects Employment Insurance benefits, they are acting with their employer's permission. In cases involving penalties for an employer, it's crucial to show that consent was part of the job requirements. This can be tricky if there are no clear written job duties or if the employee's role doesn't involve payroll tasks. Statements from the people involved are examined to figure out whose version of events is most believable.

To decide who is responsible, the person judging the situation must show that the employee was following the employer's instructions or had their permission.

In the case of a claimant, this takes the form of a written authorization. This may be a letter, a power of attorney, or authorization to act on behalf of an individual incapacitated, but the evidence shares the characteristic of being an actual document in which the third party is formally and explicitly authorized to act on the claimant's behalf.\nThere may be similar documentation available for the employer. It is most likely that express consent is captured by the conditions and duties of employment, and particularly through a written job description. An employee acts on an employer's express consent if his or her duties specifically include preparation and communication of payroll information that affects entitlement to Employment Insurance benefits. When considering a third party penalty relative to an employer, the adjudicator must be able to identify how consent exists in the terms and conditions of employment. This may be complicated when there is no written definition of job duties or if the employee's duties do not include the preparation and communication of payroll information. Verbal statements from the interested parties constitute evidence, and are examined to determine if there is one version of events that is more credible than the other(s)\n\n\n. When determining responsibility, the adjudicator must reasonably demonstrate that an employee acted with the express consent, or under the specific direction, of the employer.\nFor either the claimant or the employer, if express consent is not present, the evidence must be examined for the presence of implied consent.",0.9919742
936,936,936,"Implied consent means that a third party was given permission to act on someone's behalf based on the evidence available. The evidence must show that it is more likely than not that the third party was authorized to represent the person. 

For instance, if a third party submits a report on behalf of someone using that person's Social Insurance Number and Access Code, it is reasonable to assume that the person gave consent for the third party to do so. It's important for individuals to keep their Access Codes private because they are like a digital signature used to manage electronic claim information. By giving their Access Codes to a third party, individuals are essentially giving permission for that party to act on their behalf. 

If a person claims they did not give consent, other evidence can prove or disprove that consent. For example, if a benefit payment is deposited directly into a bank account under the person's name and no one else's, it suggests that the person knew about the payment.

If an employee has access to files that provide information, it can imply that the employee was allowed to use that information by the employer. If an unauthorized employee causes a problem, the employer needs to show what steps they took to prevent unauthorized access to important documents.

The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities. This means that it is more, and not less, likely, that the third party was authorized to represent the claimant or the employer.\nFor example, when a third party submits a claimant report using the claimant's Social Insurance Number and Access Code, the Commission can reasonably conclude that the third party acted with the claimant's consent. Claimants are reminded to keep their Access Codes private, since they are used as an electronic signature and identifier for the purposes of managing electronic data on a claim. A conscious decision to provide that information to a third party concludes the claimant gave that party permission, or consent, to act on his or her behalf. Once the Commission can reasonably conclude consent exists, the onus of proof falls to the claimant to show that such consent was not given for any particular false statement.\nIf a claimant denies consent existed, other evidence may conclude or disprove that consent. For example, when a bi-weekly benefit is directly deposited into a bank account that bears the claimant's name, it raises a presumption that the claimant knew about the payment. This is particularly true if the claimant's name is the only one recorded on the account. Evidence must be examined and a conclusion of consent must be supported by that evidence. Similarly, a denial that consent existed must be supported by the evidence.\nIf an employee has access to personnel or payroll files from which information is provided, it indicates the employee acted with the employer's consent. When an unauthorized employee is responsible for the misrepresentation, the employer must show what precautions prevent an employee from inappropriately accessing records or documents (such as Records of Employment). If the precautions are inadequate or non-existent, there is a strong presumption of implied consent.",0.99851984
937,937,937,"The law says that unless someone has mental disabilities, is unable to take care of themselves, or has passed away, they need to ask for government benefits on their own, prove they qualify, and give all the needed information to the government office. Sometimes, people might ask someone else to help them with the paperwork. This can cause issues if the helper gives false information to the government without the person's knowledge. 

If the government finds out that someone provided false information, they can give a fine. To figure out who should pay back any extra money given out because of false information, and who should get fined, the government needs to see how much the person agreed to let someone else help, and if both parties knew the information was wrong. Both people are asked questions, and evidence is collected. 

If the person agreed to let someone help and that person accidentally gave wrong information, the helper won't have to pay money back or get fined. But if the person knew the info was wrong, they have to pay back the extra money and might be fined. If both parties were involved in giving false information, the person requesting help is responsible for paying back the extra money and both may get fined.

Sometimes, without the person's knowledge, someone else can make a false benefit claim or redirect benefits for themselves. In these cases, the person making the false claims will have to pay back the extra money and might be fined.

Typically, this will occur when a claimant asks or allows a third party to complete their bi-weekly declaration to the Commission.  Problems arise when it is later discovered that representations made to the Commission by third parties, with or without the claimant's permission, were false or misleading. \nSection 38\n\n\n of the Act allows the Commission to impose a monetary penalty on any person acting for a claimant if that person knew that the representation was false or misleading.\nIn order to determine which party is liable to repay any overpayment arising out of the false representation, as well as which party is subject to a monetary penalty, the Commission must assess the extent to which the claimant asked or allowed the third party to act for them. The Commission must also determine whether or not both parties were aware that the representation was false.  Both parties must be questioned, all relevant details obtained and contradictory evidence clarified.\nIf the claimant asked or allowed a third party to act for them and the third party unknowingly made a false or misleading representation to the Commission, the third party would not be responsible for any overpayment, and no penalty would be assessed against them.  However, if the claimant knew that the information provided by the third party was false or misleading, then the claimant would be responsible for any overpayment arising out of the representation and may also be subject to a penalty.\nHowever, if the claimant asked or allowed a third party to act for them and the third party made a false or misleading representation to the Commission, where both the claimant and the third party knew that it was false or misleading (collusion), then the claimant would be responsible for any overpayment arising out of the representation and both the claimant and the third party may be subject to a penalty.\nIn addition, a third party may, without the claimant's knowledge or permission, either file a false claim for benefits based on the claimant's employment history or, once a legitimate claim is established for a claimant, make bi-weekly declarations to the Commission and direct those benefits to themselves.  In these types of situations the third party acts on their own and in effect becomes a claimant when they attempt to claim benefits that are not payable to them.  As such, the third party is responsible for any overpayment arising out of the misrepresentation and may also be subject to a penalty.\nIn all of these cases, the adjudicator must record the rationale for any decision to penalize the claimant and/or the third party, including all of the factors that were taken into account, how the amount of the penalty was determined and any mitigating circumstances that were considered.",0.78558505

However, big companies have a duty to make sure only certain people can see important papers like employment records, and that only certain people can talk about info affecting unemployment claims. If a company is careless with information, it can be seen as agreeing to wrongdoing even if they didn't know about it. On the other hand, if a company can prove they had good rules in place and an employee broke them, then the company might not be punished. If an employee uses their power in the company to lie, the blame might fall on the employee rather than the company. The penalty usually goes to the one who caused the lie, not always the employer.

Adjudication of employer and third party penalties range in complexity. The employer and the company may be the same. The employer may be a multi-national corporation. It may be difficult to say a corporate employer is capable of knowing that a misrepresentation was made. However, corporate employers have a responsibility to ensure only designated agents, or employees, can access sensitive documents such as the Record of Employment, and that only authorized employees disclose information that affects Employment Insurance claims. Negligence and carelessness in controlling information can be interpreted as implied consent, and simply being unaware of a misrepresentation does not relieve an employer of responsibility for a penalty. Conversely, a corporation may show appropriate controls are in place and that an employee abused the trust that an employer reasonably placed in that employee's integrity. When the evidence supports a genuine breach in the employer-employee relationship, penalizing the corporation may be inappropriate. The abuse of trust cannot translate to a situation in which the employer consented to their agent's action.\nSimilarly, an employer may or may not be responsible for a misrepresentation that occurs because an officer or director of the corporation abuses his or her position in the company. If there is no express or implied consent, the penalty is most appropriately assessed against the third party. Although the Commission could impose a penalty against the corporate employer in any case in which abuse occurred, Commission policy restricts that penalty to the responsible party or parties. When the Commission determines the corporate employer is not implicated in the misrepresentation, the Commission will issue a caution letter\n\n\n.

948,948,948,"A potential overpayment is the amount of benefits that someone could have received if they were eligible and met all the requirements. This is used to calculate penalties for mistakes in claiming benefits. It is calculated by multiplying the benefit rate by the average number of weeks of benefits. A potential overpayment does not change the amount of an actual overpayment or penalty.

A potential overpayment can be figured out when:
- There are still weeks of benefits left to be paid
- A benefit rate is determined
- Mistakes in claiming are discovered while the claim is still active, or could be restarted
- The mistakes affect eligibility or requirements

It's important to note that a potential overpayment only exists if the mistakes are caught in time to stop further payments. If a mistake is found after benefits have already been paid for the maximum time allowed, there won't be a potential overpayment.

The average number of weeks of benefits is calculated by taking the total number of weeks of benefits that the person should have received, subtracting the weeks that were actually paid, and then dividing the result in half.

Regular benefits are the benefits a person gets based on their work history and the local job market. To receive these benefits, a person must be able and willing to work.

The potential overpayment is used only to code the value of a violation when a penalty is assessed for misrepresentation relating to qualifying conditions    or the presence of disentitling or disqualifying    conditions that affect payment of benefits. Potential overpayment refers to a monetary value calculated by multiplying the benefit rate by the average number of weeks of regular benefit . A potential overpayment never affects the amount of an overpayment or the penalty calculation.\nA potential overpayment can be calculated when:\n\nthere are still weeks of regular benefits payable on the claim\na benefit rate is established\nthe misrepresentation is discovered while the claim is active, or may be re-activated\nthe misrepresentation affects entitlement, qualification or qualifying conditions\n\nIt is important to remember that a potential overpayment only exists when the misrepresentation is discovered in time to prevent further payment on a claim. There must also be the possibility of further payment following the disqualifying or disentitling event. Thus, a disqualifying event discovered after a claim has exhausted the 52 week window of duration cannot have a potential overpayment, as there is no possibility of payment on a claim that has ended.\nEIR 13 creates the legislative framework by which the term average number of weeks of regular benefits is defined. It says the average number of weeks is calculated by:\n\ntaking the number of weeks of regular benefits that were calculated as payable under EIA 12(2) or EIR (Fishing) 8\nsubtracting any weeks in which benefits were actually paid, and\ndividing the result in half\n\nA week of regular benefits restricts the calculation by excluding any weeks of sickness, maternity, parental, compassionate care or family caregiver benefits that may be payable in the benefit period under review. The term regular benefits refer to the weeks of benefit that directly result from the claim calculation. This is an arithmetical calculation that considers hours of insured employment and the regional rate of unemployment. Entitlement, or the right to receive the benefits calculated, depends on a claimant being ready, willing and able to seek and accept work.

Fishing claims follow the same laws and policies as other claims, but they are based on how much a fisherman earned, not just how many hours they worked. Fishing rules look at earnings to decide if someone qualifies, while regular rules look at hours worked. So, to apply for fishing benefits, the requirements are based on earnings, not hours.
Violations are categorized as unclassified, minor, serious, very serious, or subsequent, like any other violation. Just like regular claims, having an unclassified violation alone doesn't mean you need to earn more to qualify for fishing benefits. EIR (Fishing) 11(1) explains the higher earnings needed to qualify for fishing benefits if there's been a certain type of violation.

It doesn't matter if the false information was given on purpose or by accident; if there was any misleading information, the overpayment won't be canceled.

Overpayments won't be canceled if the person who received the money knew they shouldn't have, but didn't tell the Commission to correct it. The person has a duty to come forward in such situations. Claiming that the Commission shouldn't have made the payment isn't a good defense if a reasonable person would have noticed that something was wrong. For instance, if a person was paid too much and should have known, that overpayment won't be canceled.

When overpayments are canceled, it usually happens when the person who received the money isn't directly responsible for the mistake. This means they didn't cause the issue and had little control over it; they simply applied for and received the money in good faith.

Even if a debt is canceled, it can still be brought back under certain circumstances. One instance is if, after the cancellation, it turns out that the person should have received benefits for the same period as the canceled debt.",64.01482558139537,9.671744186046514,11.698219412168324,12.786046511627909,11.938953488372093,11.060930232558135,47.856589147286826,5.666666666666667,0.8429764888503335,0.8359667062759399,3.3372570354306603,0.9200138731769876,0.3888944308178833,0.0496154682039409,4.8023255813953485,4.0,2.759703531888749,21.5,23.0,6.089608635481704,1.430232558139535,1.0,0.7503079110742388,258,126,0.4883720930232558,1302,12,20.2.0,General principles,Chapter 20 - Write-off,"The Commission has a discretionary write-off authority (EI Regulation 56). This discretion must however take into consideration all the pertinent information and be exercised in a judicious manner. Therefore, when all the prescribed conditions are met, the overpayment, in whole or in part, must be written off.\nThe primary condition to consider when deciding if an overpayment may be written off is whether it arises from a false or misleading statement or representation made by the debtor, or from an error on the part of the debtor (EI Regulation 56(1)(e); 56(2)).\nIt is not necessary that the statement or representation be knowingly made as required when considering whether to impose a penalty. The fact that there is a false or misleading statement or representation, even if made inadvertently or in error, is sufficient to refuse the write-off of the overpayment.\nThe write-off of overpayments should not apply to situations where the Commission paid benefits in error and the claimant ought to have known they were not entitled to all or some of the benefits, but did not take steps to advise the Commission in order to rectify the situation. A claimant has a duty and obligation to come forward in such situations. The defense that the Commission should not have paid benefits is not valid when a reasonable person should have known or realized that something was not right.  For example, a claimant's benefit rate was incorrectly calculated, and the claimant was receiving an amount almost equal to the wages they received while working.  As the claimant ought to have known that their benefit rate was too high, any overpayment created will not be written off.\nThe common characteristics found in the situations and circumstances leading to an overpayment write off, are that the claimant cannot be held directly responsible for the events which led to the overpayment.  In other words, the claimant did not play a role in or have any real control over the events except to request and receive the benefits in good faith.\nA debt that has been written off is still owing and can, under certain circumstances, be revived. One such circumstance is when after a write-off, benefits become payable for the same period as the period for which the overpayment was established and written off.",0.9864907
982,982,982,"Whenever a decision is made that affects something in the past and leads to receiving too much money from EI benefits, several questions need to be considered:
- Did the extra payment happen because of a mistake or false information given by the person claiming EI benefits?
- Which specific rules apply in this situation?
- Can any part of the extra payment be canceled?

It's important to decide about canceling the overpayment at the same time the initial decision leading to the extra payment is made. If the decision is made later on, the person who paid back some of the extra money cannot get it refunded. In cases where canceling the overpayment was not considered when it happened, the person can still ask for the extra payment to be canceled, and a decision will be made on that request.",51.6354632867133,14.93851398601399,12.161744961471694,17.097202797202797,17.722342657342658,9.934825174825171,60.92482517482517,9.0,0.915315051873525,0.9145521521568298,3.3669294294294296,0.2084644198418898,0.4478228228228229,0.0623043972685723,4.5174825174825175,4.0,2.51388632032408,35.75,27.5,18.0329559418305,1.4055944055944056,1.0,0.639468335085557,143,83,0.5804195804195804,662,4,20.3.0,Application,Chapter 20 - Write-off,"Whenever there is a decision that has a retroactive effect and which will result in an overpayment of EI benefits, the following questions should be asked:\n\nDid the overpayment result from an error, or a false statement or representation made by the claimant (Digest 20.3.0)?  If yes, the overpayment is not written off, and no further consideration is required.\nWhich section of the regulations applies (EI Regulations 56(1)(e); 56(2); Digest 20.6.0)?\nWhat portion of the overpayment, if any, may be written off (Digest 20.5.0)?\n\nCare must be taken to ensure that the decision to write off, or not, is made at the same time the decision causing the overpayment is made.

When a decision is made that leads to an overpayment, and some of it is going to be forgiven, it is assumed that you will be notified of the overpayment within two weeks of that decision. This two-week period is to help you, accounting for any delays in getting the notice. If you can show that you were actually told about the overpayment later than assumed, the amount to be forgiven will be adjusted. However, individual reviews won't be done to adjust the amount based on the real notification date.

In these cases, someone who received too much money from the government can ask for the repayment to be forgiven. The government will review the person's finances and then decide whether to cancel the repayment.

Repayments under $100 with no ongoing benefits or regular payments being received, debts from those who have passed away, debts from bankrupt individuals who have already completed the bankruptcy process, debts that are impossible to collect, debts that would cause extreme financial hardship if repaid, and debts where collecting the money would be more expensive than the actual debt are all situations where the government might forgive the overpayment.

When someone declares bankruptcy, their overpayment is typically forgiven. However, if the overpayment resulted from purposely giving false information and this was proven after an appeal process, then even bankruptcy won't erase this debt. Just requesting a review by the government is not enough; the decision must come from a higher appeal court.

1009,1009,1009,"To make a decision, a person needs to figure out how believable the evidence is. This helps decide how important the information is in making the final decision. The value of evidence can't be decided using random rules. It depends on common sense, logic, and experience. 

Firsthand knowledge, where someone directly knows the information, is more important than second- or third-hand knowledge. Indirect evidence should only be used to support a case, not as the main evidence.

There are guides to help decide how much importance to give evidence. The most reliable evidence is a statement by the person involved in the situation. But if the situation involves bad behavior or leaving on purpose, the decision can't only be based on their statement. The employer should also share their side of the story before deciding. 

When a person changes their statement or wants to clarify it, the new explanation should be accepted if it makes sense. Evidence from someone not linked to the situation is usually more reliable than from someone who has a connection. 

All evidence should be considered, but any irrelevant or weak information should be ignored. Evidence should be connected to the issue being looked at to be useful. 

Looking at how valuable the evidence is can help decide its weight. If evidence makes something more likely to be true, then it's relevant. 

If there's a chance that there's better evidence available, it should be found. Statements written and signed by the person sharing the information are usually more trustworthy than those recorded or summarized by someone else. Claimants should try to write their own statements when possible.

Indirect evidence should not be used in isolation unless there is no direct evidence available and in general should be used just to confirm and strengthen the case.\nThe following are general guidelines that may help in assessing the weight to be given to evidence. The most reliable form of evidence is an admission by the claimant of the existence of a fact that is exculpatory or prejudicial. However, in the case of misconduct or voluntary leaving a decision cannot be based solely on the claimant's statement. The agent must give the employer the opportunity to provide information as to the reasons for the loss of employment; and where any such information is provided, take it into account to determine the claim    . The three-step procedure    with respect to the gathering and consideration of evidence must be followed before making a decision on entitlement.\nFaced with conflicting statements from a claimant, the tendency should be to give more weight, or credibility to the claimant's first statement, especially when the first statement gave rise to a disentitlement. There is no hard and fast rule for automatically giving more credence to the first statement, so the agent must consider and weigh all evidence, and the conditions under which the evidence was given in each case.\nThere is a difference between changing a statement and trying to clarify or expand on a prior statement. Often a claimant will attempt to clarify a prior statement that was brief or vague, or given in response to a general question; and people do sometimes change their minds. The claimant's subsequent statement should be accepted when it is credible and reasonable.\nInformation from a source totally independent of the parties involved is usually more credible than that from someone who is related to one or other of the parties, or from someone who has something to gain or lose depending on the outcome. For example: payroll department, worker's compensation.\nWhile the agent should look at all available evidence, any information that is irrelevant to the issue at hand, or evidence that is so weak as to be ineffective, should be ruled out.\nFor evidence to be relevant it must be applicable to the issue and there must be a logical relationship; it must have a bearing on the question at issue. Consideration should not be given to irrelevant facts.\nThe degree of relevancy is important and it follows that the more relevant the evidence, the more weight is placed on it. The most acceptable test of relevancy is the question: does the evidence offered render the proposition more probable than it would be without the evidence?\nWhen you have evidence or information on a case and you think there may be additional evidence that is more credible, more relevant, or more direct and it is reasonably available, then steps to obtain that evidence must be taken.\nIncreased credibility is given to a statement which was written and signed by the person giving the information because of the possibility of a misunderstanding when one party records or summarizes another's statement. Our clients should therefore be encouraged to write their own statements when possible. This practice may not always be practical especially if claim processing time will be impeded. However, it is especially advisable in those cases where there are conflicting statements, or where there are inconsistencies in the statements made.\nA statement written by the claimant will be less vulnerable to allegations of bias or partiality against the agent. Where this is not possible the credibility of a statement taken by the agent can be enhanced by:\n\nadvising the claimant as to the purpose of the interview, i.e., to determine his or her initial or continuing entitlement to benefit\nadvising the claimant that a decision will be made on the claim based on the information given\ngiving the claimant the opportunity to raise objections or provide clarification as required and when possible,\ngiving the claimant the opportunity to sign the statement indicating that all of the above took place and that he or she agrees with the statement as written. Otherwise the agent should document the file indicating that the above took place.\n\nThese actions will lend support to the decision of the Commission and at the same time the claimant is less likely to retract the statement at a later date.",0.9381732

Sometimes both sides' stories are equally believable, so it's hard to decide on one. In these situations, the version that helps the person making the claim is usually chosen.

Sometimes opinions and interpretations of the evidence are mistaken for facts. It's important to focus on the actual facts and not just opinions. However, if an expert gives an opinion on a technical or professional matter, that opinion is considered important.

In the past, terms like burden of proof and degree of proof were used to determine who needs to prove which facts.

For example, the Regulation     states that a claimant who alleges an incapacity for work is required to furnish a certificate completed by a medical doctor or other medical professional attesting to the claimant's incapability to work. Quite clearly, the claimant must provide proof to be eligible for sickness benefits. When the proof is not provided, there can be no eligibility.\nHowever, in the case of false or misleading statements, jurisprudence consistently maintains that the Commission bears the full weight of proof and is responsible for confirming that the person not only made false or misleading statements but also made them knowingly   . The Act    provides for imposition of a penalty in these instances. For example, when a claimant fails to report earnings on the report form, that report form is evidence that a false statement was made. However, before a penalty can be imposed the Commission must prove that the claimant knew that his or her statement was false.\nObjective questions such as Did you work? are generally easier to prove because they are based on tangible facts, e.g. earnings. Subjective questions such as availability are more difficult to prove, but in either case, the claimant must be given the opportunity to explain the statement: when the explanation is credible, it cannot be concluded that the statement was intended to mislead; when the reverse is true, the claimant becomes subject to a penalty.\nIn all cases a thorough review of all available material relevant to the matter, including the verification and assessment of the credibility of the evidence must take place.

1033,1033,1033,"In June 2013, a law called the Employment Insurance Legislation was created to help parents of seriously ill children. As of December 3, 2017, improvements were made to these benefits and they are now called family caregiver benefits for children. These benefits allow a parent to get paid time off work to take care of a child who is very sick or injured. The parent doesn't need to look for another job while getting these benefits.

A person can get up to 35 weeks of family caregiver benefits for kids in a year, whether all the weeks go to one person or are shared among family members. There's a limit of 35 weeks per claim. 

On December 3, 2017, the law also started family caregiver benefits for adults. These benefits allow someone to get paid time off work to take care of an adult who is seriously ill or injured.

For adults, a person can get up to 15 weeks of family caregiver benefits in a year, which can be given to one person or divided among family members. There's a limit of 15 weeks per claim. 

The law can make more rules about what counts as taking care of someone, who can give a medical note, when the time limit can be longer than a year, when the wait time before benefits start can be postponed, and what happens if family members can't agree on how to share the weeks of benefits.

As long as the eligible claimant is providing the necessary care or support to the family member, and depending on the number of hours devoted to the course of instruction, it is acceptable to attend a course of instruction on the claimant's own initiative, while in receipt of compassionate care benefits, as availability for work is not a factor in determining entitlement to receive these benefits.\nThe individual can still be considered to be providing care or support to a gravely ill family member when doing so outside the hours of another activity. The fact that a claimant may not be providing direct care while devoting time to the course of instruction, does not mean that the claimant will automatically be denied benefits. However when the claimant's reason for not working is not, or ceases to be, to care for the gravely ill family member, entitlement to compassionate care benefits is not proven, and the claimant may be subject to a disentitlement. The circumstances of each case must be considered individually.\nThere may be situations where it may be determined that a claimant is not meeting the condition of providing care or support to the gravely ill family member. An example of this would be where the brother who requested and is receiving compassionate care benefits, leaves the gravely ill family member to the care of someone else in Ottawa, and relocates temporarily to Vancouver for a few weeks, to attend a course, thereby no longer providing care and support to the gravely ill parent for these weeks.

If you want to get EI benefits, you have to apply and show that you meet the requirements for a benefit period where you can receive payments. The Canada Employment Insurance Commission will review your application and let you know if you qualify.

The rules also allow for claims to be made on behalf of people who have passed away, are unable to work, or are mentally incapable.

There are three types of claims: initial, continuing, and renewal. The initial claim starts a benefit period during which you can receive payments. Continuing and renewal claims are made for weeks of unemployment during an existing benefit period.",60.77369461486029,9.281922290388549,13.383793397009324,14.36100886162236,10.048623040218132,10.55877300613497,42.65098841172461,4.444444444444445,0.802522711455822,0.7926700966698783,2.4684671288694275,0.3145696708420235,0.4395154473028036,0.0638973956493,4.7607361963190185,4.0,2.556920971948094,18.11111111111111,16.0,5.546659544154971,1.50920245398773,1.0,0.8389892996349557,163,96,0.588957055214724,799,9,24.4.1,Payment of benefits,Chapter 24 - Benefits for the self-employed,"Employment Insurance (EI) benefits are not paid based on the personal needs or financial obligations of an individual. Equally, the fact that one has paid premiums to the EI fund does not by itself give rights to receive benefits as would be the case when purchasing an insurance policy. Eligibility depends on abiding by the various conditions established by the law.\n An individual who wishes to receive benefits must first indicate their intention by making a claim and proving that they meet the conditions necessary to establish a benefit period for which benefits may be payable in that period (FCA A-0541.85, CUB 10633; EIA 152.1(1)). Filing an initial claim allows the Canada Employment Insurance Commission (the Commission) to decide whether the self-employed person is qualified to receive benefits and notify the person of its decision (EIA 152.12).\n The Employment Insurance Regulations also provide for the making of claims for benefit by, and for the payment of benefits to, any person or agency on behalf of deceased or incapacitated persons or persons of unsound mind (EIR 27(1),  EIR 27(2)).\n There are 3 categories of claims for benefit: the initial, the continuing and the renewal claim.

For instance, the Federal Court of Appeal has stated that misconduct only occurs when an action is done on purpose, meaning the behavior that caused someone to be fired was done knowingly and intentionally. This means misconduct happens when an employee is aware or should have been aware that their actions would harm their ability to fulfill their duties to the employer, leading to the possibility of being fired.

The reality for the self-employed, however, is that regardless of their need for special benefits, the business may be required to continue or it could face risk of closure. The business of farming is an example where, despite an illness, the farm must be maintained. Accordingly, it is not required that self-employed persons completely cease their self-employment activities in order to be eligible, but demonstrate a reduction in the time devoted to their business activities by more than 40% of the normal level and then continue to experience a week of unemployment (EIR 30.1; section 24.3.2 of the Digest). \nTherefore, it follows that self-employed workers who continue to perform some work during their claim will also generate income from their business during the same period for which they are seeking special benefits. In some cases even though the self-employed person ceases to perform any work, the business may still continue to generate income for them and this income must be considered when determining the amount of benefits payable.\nEmployment Insurance Regulation 35 lists what constitutes earnings to be deducted from any benefits payable to a claimant. Self-employment earnings for benefit purposes includes the entire income of a claimant arising out of any employment. \nAny income generated from self-employment, be it from the performance of service, a transaction or any other combination thereof, including profits, commission and farming subsidies, are deducted from benefits (EIR 35(2)). Earnings nullify the financial loss incurred by the claimant, so in order to prevent double indemnification, these benefits and advantages are deducted from benefits. \nThe sole consideration in determining whether income is earnings for EI purposes lies in the relationship of that income to employment. If there is no direct correlation to employment, income earned by a claimant who requests EI benefits will not be deducted from benefits. For example, lottery winnings are not considered earnings since they are gained from luck, not work. Likewise, inheritance monies or capital gains from the sale of a personal home or cottage bear no link to employment and so are not earnings for EI purposes. \nThe income of a self-employed claimant, including farmers, is the amount remaining after deducting the operating expenses excluding capital expenditures.\nEmployment Insurance Regulation 36(6) explains where to allocate self-employment earnings in a benefit period.

Since he provided services over an 8-week period before he became ill and the start of his EI claim, the amount of his EI benefits is unaffected by the $1,200 payment.\nSelf-employment earnings and parental benefits\nAnne and her son Louis are co-owners of a campground. According to their partnership agreement, they divide the annual revenues equally between them. Anne and Louis registered with the EI program so they could access EI special benefits if needed.  Eighteen months later, Louis' wife gave birth to a child and Louis was eligible for 35 weeks of parental benefits. While Louis is no longer working, the business continues to generate income. In accordance with their partnership agreement, Louis continues to be entitled to half of the partnership's net income while he is on parental leave. During the week of July 8-14, Louis earned $300 in net income from camping services rendered. Earnings are deducted at a rate of 50 cents of EI benefits for every dollar earned during the week where services were rendered. Therefore, since 50% of his net self-employment earnings of $300 is $150, $150 will be deducted from his benefit rate for the week of July 8-14.\nSelf-employment earnings and maternity, parental benefits\nSimone is a real estate agent. Her income consists solely of commissions from the sale of houses. Simone registered with the EI program so she could access EI special benefits if needed.  Some years later, Simone has her first child and applies for maternity benefits. She is entitled to 15 weeks of maternity benefits and is claiming 61 weeks of extended parental benefits. Her benefit rate is calculated at $562 per week for maternity benefits and $337 per week for extended parental benefits. On September 9, a house listed by Simone before she left on leave sells and her net commission on the sale is $6,500. The amount of the commission is allocated to the weeks in which the work that gave rise to the transaction was performed, in other words, over 21 weeks (from the date of the listing until September 9). The amount to be allocated to each of the 21 weeks is $310 ($6,500 \u00f7 21 weeks). Earnings are deducted at a rate of 50 cents of EI benefits for every dollar earned during each week in which the work that gave rise to the transaction was performed. Therefore, since 50% of her allocated net self-employment commission earnings of $310 is $155, $155 will be deducted from her weekly benefit rate for that period. \nSelf-employment earnings and compassionate care benefits\nEric is a self-employed farmer who works year-round on his farm growing barley, wheat, and canola. Eric registered with the EI program in April 2018 so he could access EI special benefits if needed. In September 2019, Eric's mother becomes gravely ill with a significant risk of death within 26 weeks. He applies for EI compassionate care benefits and based on the medical certificate he provides, is entitled to the maximum 26 weeks of benefits. His benefit rate is established at $212 a week.  On October 17, 2019, Eric sells some of his barley, resulting in net farming earnings of $1,900 that are allocated to the weeks in which the work that gave rise to the transaction was performed. Since the work was performed from March 29 to August 19, 2019, his EI benefit amount is not affected by this transaction.",0.9923969

1132,1132,1132,"Once you've signed up for Employment Insurance (EI) benefits for self-employed people and waited for one year since you signed up, you can access six different types of special benefits if you qualify. These benefits include sickness, maternity, parental, compassionate care, family caregiver benefits for children, and family caregiver benefits for adults. If you're self-employed in Quebec, you can only get EI sickness, compassionate care, and family caregiver benefits because maternity and parental benefits are provided through the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan.

The conditions to get these special benefits as a self-employed person are similar to those for regular employees and self-employed fishers, but there are some differences explained in each section. You can receive special benefits at any time during the benefit period, but there are specific time limits for maternity, parental, and compassionate care benefits.

Each special benefit has a maximum number of weeks you can receive it during one benefit period. For example, maternity benefits can be received for up to 15 weeks, standard parental benefits for 35 weeks, extended parental benefits for 61 weeks, sickness benefits for 26 weeks, family caregiver benefits for children for 35 weeks, family caregiver benefits for adults for 15 weeks, and compassionate care benefits for 26 weeks. These benefits can be combined during the benefit period if you qualify for each.

If your initial benefit period is extended, you can receive up to 102 weeks of different special benefits, as long as you fulfill certain conditions, like not maxing out on the number of weeks for each benefit in the initial period. Benefits not received in the initial period cannot be paid during the extended period.

For people under the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan, the benefits received count towards the overall maximum number of weeks payable under the EI program for maternity or parental benefits.

These parameters are explained below. \n 24.8.1 Limits to the number of weeks of special benefits payable \n Each type of special benefit has an individual maximum number of weeks payable in one benefit period (EIA 152.14(1)).

In this example, since illness benefits were not paid during the initial benefit period, they could not be paid during the extended period.\n Regarding the QuÃƒÂ©bec Parental Insurance Plan (QPIP), EI legislation introduced a principle of equivalence which applies to EI special benefits for the self-employed. Each week of provincial benefits paid to a self-employed person in a benefit period is considered as a week for which benefits are paid under the EI program if the claimant would have been entitled to the corresponding benefits under the EI program (EIR 76.36).

During a benefit period, you can receive a maximum total of 102 weeks of different special benefits if your initial 52-week benefit period is extended by up to 104 weeks. This can only happen if you have received more than one type of special benefit and if at least one of these benefits was not received for the full number of weeks it can be paid for. 

If you didn't receive a specific type of special benefit during the initial benefit period, you won't be able to receive it during the extended period. For example, if you received maternity, parental, and compassionate care benefits during the initial 52-week period, you could receive additional weeks of these benefits during the extension, but not sickness benefits since they weren't received initially.

In Quebec, self-employed individuals can also receive special benefits. Each week that you receive provincial benefits as a self-employed person is counted as a week of benefits under the federal program, as long as you would have been eligible for the same benefits under the federal program.

These benefits help parents take time off work to care for their child. The law about parental benefits has changed over time. It used to require parents to stay home all the time to care for their child, but now it recognizes that parents can still provide care even if they are not always at home.

It is important to consider each situation individually when deciding if a parent is eligible for parental benefits. For example, if a child is in the hospital, the parent is still responsible for the child, even though they are not at home all the time. Similarly, if a parent goes on vacation while receiving parental benefits, they can still get those benefits because the benefits are not based on their availability.

In short, parental benefits are designed to support parents in caring for their child, whether they are at home, in the hospital with the child, or even on vacation.",60.7280434782609,10.50282608695652,14.005844860021307,15.504347826086956,12.0329347826087,10.33173913043478,49.6304347826087,6.125,0.8171706114496503,0.8407436609268188,2.914480440228218,0.688643387718034,0.4857139081484932,0.067433305845131,4.663043478260869,4.0,2.4149767030699305,23.0,26.5,8.231038816577165,1.451086956521739,1.0,0.7786547157447946,184,86,0.4673913043478261,879,8,24.11.4,Second entitlement condition: to care for a child,Chapter 24 - Benefits for the self-employed,"Under the EI program, parental benefits are payable to parents to care for one or more newborn children or one or more children placed with the claimant for the purpose of adoption.\n\r\n   Parental benefits therefore provide a means of financial support allowing a parent(s) to be away from work entirely, or to an extent that they would still be considered unemployed during weeks they are receiving benefits to care for the child (EIR 30(1)). \n\r\n   Parental legislation has evolved over the years to where it no longer refers to remaining at home to care for the child. It is unreasonable to expect a parent to cease all regular activity and simply remain at home for 35 or 61 weeks to care for the child. While the intent of the legislation is to allow the parent to bond with and care for the child, when the parent is providing for the needs of the child the requirement of caring for the child is met. This means a claimant may leave the home for periods and continue to receive parental benefits, whether the child is with the parent during these activities or not. \n\r\n   A reasoned approach should be taken and each case should be decided on its own merit having regard for the intent to allow a parent to care for the child. It has been argued that a child who is admitted to hospital cannot be considered to be in the care of the parent, therefore no entitlement to parental benefits exists. The reality of this situation is that the parent continues to be responsible for the child. Furthermore, in many cases the parent's presence and assistance is specifically requested by either the doctor or the hospital.\n\r\n   This same reasoning holds true for those claimants who decide to take a vacation while in receipt of parental benefits.

1155,1155,1155,"When a new baby is born or adopted, there is usually a one-week waiting period before parents can start receiving benefits. This waiting period can be skipped if the parent received paid sick leave after stopping work.

If one parent has already gone through the waiting period and started receiving benefits for the child, the other parent can delay their waiting period. Parents can also choose to split the benefits and decide which parent will wait for their benefits to start.

Delaying a waiting period is not the same as skipping it. If a parent delays their waiting period, they will have to serve it later before getting other types of benefits. However, if a second benefit period is set up, the parent can postpone the waiting period to receive all the benefits allowed within a certain time frame.

The benefits must be claimed within 52 weeks after the week the child is born or placed for the purpose of adoption (EIA 152.14(1)(b), EIA 152.05(2)). \n\r\n   Extended parental benefits are payable for a maximum of 61 weeks at a lower benefit rate of 33% of a claimant's weekly insurable earnings, up to a maximum amount. The benefits must be claimed within 78 weeks after the week the child is born or placed for the purpose of adoption (EIA 152.14(1)(b), EIA 152.05(2)). \n\r\n   The implementation of the parental sharing benefit on March 17, 2019 added weeks to standard and extended parental benefits. If more than one parent requests parental benefits for the same child, they can claim an additional 5 weeks of standard parental or an additional 8 weeks of extended parental benefits. This increases the maximum shareable standard parental benefits to 40 weeks and the maximum shareable extended parental benefits to 69 weeks (EIA 152.05(12). This applies even if one parent makes a claim for benefits under Part I and the other parent makes a claim under Part VII.1 (EIA 23(4.1)). However, one claimant cannot receive more than 35 standard weeks or 61 extended weeks of parental benefits per birth or placement and per benefit period.\n\r\n   Parents sharing benefits are required to select the same option, either standard or extended. The option chosen by the first parent who completes the EI application binds the other parent(s) to the same option (EIA 152.05(1.3)). Once parental benefits have been paid on a claim, the claimant's choice to receive standard or extended parental benefit is irrevocable (EIA 152.05(1.2)). \n\r\n   The Quebec Parental Insurance Plan introduced a principle of equivalence for the purposes of the EI program, which applies to EI special benefits for the self-employed. Each week of provincial benefits paid to a self-employed person in a benefit period is considered as a week for which benefits are paid under the EI program if the claimant would have been entitled to the corresponding benefits under the EI program (EIR 76.36). Accordingly, each of these weeks is considered in calculating the overall maximum number of weeks of EI parental benefits payable during a benefit period and in calculating the maximum number of weeks of EI benefits payable with regard to a birth or an adoption (please see the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan on the Government of Canada website).\n\r\n   Eligible parents can also share the number of weeks of parental benefits payable under the EI program and the parental or adoption benefits payable under a provincial plan, such as the QPIP for the same birth or adoption of a child (EIR 76.42). However, the maximum number of weeks of benefits that can be paid under the EI program cannot exceed the maximum number of 40 weeks less the number of weeks of benefits that have been paid to the other parent (taking into account any weeks of benefits that are paid at the accelerated rate under the provincial plan (EIR 76.42(3)). \n\r\n   In cases of extended parental benefits, the maximum number of weeks of benefits that can be paid to a parent is determined by using the following formula (A - B) x C \u00f7 D, where: \n\nA is 40, the maximum number of weeks of standard parental benefits when the weeks of benefits are shared (EIA 152.14(2)(b)(i)) \nB is the number of weeks of benefits that are paid to the claimant governed by the provincial plan (taking into account, where appropriate, the weeks of benefits that are paid at the accelerated rate under the provincial plan) (EIR 76.4(3)) \nC is 61, the maximum number of weeks of extended parental benefits payable per benefit period (EIA 152.14(1)(b)(ii))\nD is 35, the maximum number of weeks of standard parental benefits payable per benefit period (EIA 152.14(1)(b)(i))",0.9912164

When it comes to family caregiver benefits, sometimes people wait to apply. If someone couldn't apply right away because they were taking care of someone, they can request to have their application date moved earlier. This means they might get benefits starting from an earlier date.

This program requires an agreement between the employer, employees, and a government organization called the Canada Employment Insurance Commission. It gives temporary support to eligible workers by providing them with EI benefits while they work fewer hours than usual because of an approved Work-Sharing agreement. The company aims to go back to normal business levels while employees work a reduced schedule.
In this program, when a company applies for Work-Sharing, they commit to reducing employees' work hours by 10% to 60% for a period of time. Workers agree to share the reduced workload equally to help prevent job cuts. The goal is for all employees in the program to go back to their regular hours by the end of the agreement.
This program helps companies keep their experienced staff and saves money that would otherwise be spent on hiring and training new employees when business picks up. For employees, it helps them keep their jobs and skills intact, as they would receive EI benefits for the days they are not working due to the Work-Sharing program.
Employers need to come up with a plan detailing what they will do during the Work-Sharing period to get back to normal business levels by the end of the agreement. This plan is part of the Work-Sharing agreement.

It provides income support in the form of EI benefits to eligible workers who temporarily work a reduced work week under an approved Work-Sharing agreement, while their employer attempts to return to normal levels of activity.\nWhen an employer applies for a Work-Sharing agreement, the employer must agree to aim for a reduction of between 10% and 60% in the employees' regular work schedule over the term of the agreement. Workers agree to work a reduced week and to share the available work equally over the term of the Work-Sharing agreement, to avoid layoffs. The goal is for all participating employees to return to normal working hours by the end of the term of the Work-Sharing agreement.\nThe program helps employers retain skilled employees and avoid the costly process of recruiting and training new employees when business returns to normal levels. It also helps employees maintain their skills and jobs by supplementing their wages with EI benefits for the days they are not working due to the Work-Sharing agreement.\nEmployers must develop a Recovery Plan to indicate what activities or measures they will be implementing during the Work-Sharing period that would result in a return to normal employment levels by the end of the agreement. The Recovery Plan forms part of, and is integral to, the Work-Sharing agreement.\nOnce a Work-Sharing agreement ends, the employer must serve a mandatory cooling-off period of a number of weeks equal to, or greater than, the period covered by the previous Work-Sharing agreement before entering a new Work-Sharing agreement involving the same work unit.",0.9985197

Core employees must be year-round, permanent full-time or part-time employees of the company. Employers should reduce staff to core levels prior to entering into a Work-Sharing agreement.\nTemporary (in other words, term or contract) employees are considered to be eligible core employees provided they are not employed on a seasonal basis. Temporary employees are only eligible if they have maintained hours similar to permanent full-time or part-time employees within the last 12 months. Employees hired on a casual or on-call basis or through a temporary help agency are not eligible. Some employers have long-standing agreements with temporary help agencies and consider these employees to be a part of the company. However, for the purposes of participating in a Work-Sharing agreement, these employees are not included.\nEmployees hired on a seasonal basis, such as students hired for the summer or for a co-op term are not eligible for the program. However, students not employed on a seasonal basis may participate.\nEmployees who are paid by piece work are eligible to participate in a Work-Sharing agreement. Piece work is defined as payment based on the amount of goods produced, rather than hours worked.\nForeign workers with a valid work permit have the same rights and responsibilities as Canadian citizens and permanent residents, and therefore, may participate in the Work-Sharing program. \nEmployees who are minor shareholders in the business and whose shares do not provide them with significant decision-making power within the company are eligible to participate in the Work-Sharing program. Pursuant to paragraph 5(2)(b) of the EIA, employment of a person who controls more than 40% of the voting shares in the company is not insurable employment. Consequently, a worker in this situation would not be eligible to participate in the Work-Sharing program, as an employee.\nSome employers may have been unable to avoid layoffs prior to applying to participate in the Work-Sharing program. Core employees who were in layoff status prior to the agreement start date may be eligible to participate.\nA claimant may work for more than one employer at the same time; however, the employee cannot collect Work-Sharing benefits under more than 1 Work-Sharing agreement at the same time. Employment from all employers in a claimant's qualifying period will be taken into account when calculating the employee's Work-Sharing benefits. Where a claimant is participating in more than 1 Work-Sharing agreement, they may choose under which agreement they wish to be paid EI benefits. Although they cannot be paid under both agreements, no earnings from either Work-Sharing employment will be deducted from benefits, for the duration of each agreement.",0.9980071
1201,1201,1201,"A Work-Sharing unit is a group of employees who are eligible for Employment Insurance (EI) and have agreed to reduce their regular work hours to prevent layoffs. Each unit must have at least two eligible employees. Typically, a Work-Sharing unit includes employees who have similar job roles, like those in the same department or doing the same work. However, not all employees in a company are part of a Work-Sharing unit; it depends on the company's size.

All employees in a Work-Sharing unit must reduce their hours equally if work hours are reduced. If work increases during the agreement, employees must share the extra work equally. Employees who have different job roles but are affected by the same business slowdown can still be part of the unit and must also reduce their hours equally.

Employees who perform critical functions for the business recovery, like senior management or sales agents, should not be included in the Work-Sharing unit. If a business has only one employee in each job category, they can still form a unit if agreeing on the same hour reduction. If another group of employees is affected by a work shortage, they can join the existing agreement by request.

If a new group of employees is affected by a different work shortage, a new full-term agreement can be submitted by the employer.",66.18548589341694,9.267351097178686,12.079253325248375,13.09153605015674,10.878902821316617,9.966206896551723,48.67711598746081,5.818181818181818,0.8547792732715607,0.8509969313939413,2.7765622092775204,0.440189570043642,0.4283985020827126,0.0574930173169596,4.620689655172414,4.0,2.457062910278326,21.09090909090909,23.0,5.791130294048359,1.4094827586206895,1.0,0.6888869643872897,232,101,0.4353448275862069,1103,11,25.2.1.3,Work-Sharing unit at place of employment,Chapter 25 - Work-Sharing,"A Work-Sharing  unit is a group of EI eligible core employees who have agreed to reduce  their normal working hours in order to share the available work and avoid  layoffs. There must be a minimum of 2 EI  eligible employees in each Work-Sharing  unit. \nThe Work-Sharing  unit generally includes all employees in a single job description or all  employees in the same department, division, plant or operational unit of a  company. The Work-Sharing unit  does not necessarily include all of the employees in the company. A Work-Sharing agreement with a  large company may be comprised of several Work-Sharing units with different job descriptions or from  different departments, while a smaller company may have only 1 Work-Sharing unit. \nEmployees who form a Work-Sharing unit should perform similar job duties so that they  can share the available work. All employees who are part of the Work-Sharing unit must reduce their regular hours of  work on an equal basis (in other words, same percentage of reduction). If  during the period of the Work-Sharing  agreement, work activities increase, the additional hours of work must  be shared equally among all employees in the Work-Sharing unit. Employees who do different work but whose jobs  impact one another (in other words, slowdown in business affects one job  resulting in less work for another job or jobs) may be part of the Work-Sharing unit, provided  all employees reduce their hours equally. If the employer cannot ensure that  the available work will be shared equally among all employees from any aspect  of the operation, an amendment to the Work-Sharing agreement may be negotiated.\nEmployees who share the same job description (or do similar  work) as those in a Work-Sharing  unit, but do not wish to participate in a Work-Sharing agreement or who are not  eligible to receive EI benefits are still required to reduce their hours of  work on an equal basis as employees who are participating in a Work-Sharing agreement.  Individual workers cannot volunteer to participate in Work-Sharing while others 'opt out' and  continue to work normal hours. \nEmployees who are needed to help generate work and thus  assist in the recovery of the business should not be included in the Work-Sharing unit. Examples  include senior management, executive level marketing and sales agents, outside  sales representatives, or technical employees engaged in product development.  In other words, employees performing functions essential to the development and  implementation of the recovery of the business should be working full-time in  support of the recovery plan. Other supervisors/managers are eligible to take  part and may be included in the Work-Sharing  unit, as long as they are not determining the direction of the company. \nSome businesses  (typically smaller businesses) may have only one employee in each job category  (in other words, all employees in the business are doing a different job).  Provided the employer can clearly demonstrate that participation in Work-Sharing will avoid the temporary layoff of at least 1  employee, employees with different job descriptions may form one Work-Sharing unit. The employees must all agree to the  same percentage of reduction to their normal working hours. \nOnce an agreement is  in place, if a different group of employees becomes affected by the same work  shortage, the employer may submit an amendment request in order to add this new  unit to the agreement. The new Work-Sharing unit will not be eligible for the full term of the agreement; they will have the same end date as the  original Work-Sharing unit(s). However, if a different group of  employees is affected by a new work shortage (in other words, another set of  circumstances beyond the control of the employer), a new application for an  agreement may be submitted by the  employer for a new full-length term.",0.9991918

Most employees work a set amount of hours every week throughout the year, even if the hours change a bit week to week. This allows for workers to get paid the right amount when they lose work under the Work-Sharing agreement. Sometimes, workers have unusual schedules because of the type of work they do or because of an agreement with their employer. In these cases, a regular Work-Sharing rule where workers need to work a small amount each week may not work well. For example, flight attendants have rules about how many hours they can work each month, which can vary a lot. In these cases, the Work-Sharing rules may need to be adjusted to make sure workers are paid correctly.

Regardless of the pay period type (weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly or monthly), most employees work regular hours in each calendar week of the year. Even when hours vary from week-to-week, they average in a manner that allows appropriate payment of Work-Sharing benefits for any loss of employment under the Work-Sharing agreement.\nHowever, there are situations where employees do not work a conventional schedule. This may be due to the nature of the work itself, or due to the way in which the employer and employees have agreed to manage the work. This does not include patterns of work in which a claimant's regular schedule includes lay days (Digest 4.3.5).\nFor example, flight attendants are federally restricted in the total number of hours of flight time per month. The hourly loss of employment for the purposes of Work-Sharing cannot be accurately calculated on a calendar week basis. This is because the employment can be extended or compressed into irregular patterns, based on the flight attendant's ability and willingness to work, within the restrictions of the law. Historically, flight attendants work approximately 75 hours over a period of approximately 1 month. When they work less than 75 hours, the hours lost can only be considered in the context of the 1 month period. In this specific case, strict application of the requirement to have one half hour of work in each calendar week does not meet the intent of the Work-Sharing legislation.\nAlthough these cases are highly exceptional situations, in cases where work patterns may not be traditional, the program officer will examine the employer's scheduling history and decide if the conventional application of one half hour of job duties in a calendar week will correctly identify weeks in which there is a loss of employment due to Work-Sharing. If the conventional manner of defining a Work-Sharing week will not fairly compensate an employee for the loss of work, the Commission may develop a formula that considers the true loss of work and allows appropriate payment of benefits. There is no pre-set formula, since these situations are not always pre-set. The legislation therefore allows flexibility and the calculation will respond to the specific circumstances of that employment. The program officer maintains control over the final determination, but must advise the Commission of exceptional situations, to facilitate the correct payment of Work-Sharing benefits.\n\n\nReport navigation\n\nPrevious part of report\nTable of contents Go to Table of contents\nNext part of report",0.97793365

- The person stops working for the Work-Sharing employer, or 
- There is a complete stoppage of work in the workplace (like a layoff or shutdown). 

If the person then asks for other benefits, their claim may need to be reviewed to make sure they qualify before they can get those benefits. At that point, the person is no longer part of the Work-Sharing program. 

In the case of a complete stoppage of work in the workplace, the Work-Sharing agreement might be canceled, or the program officer might approve a layoff period and keep the agreement active until work starts again. The program officer decides whether the agreement continues during a complete shutdown. The main goal is to carefully look at the person's situation and make sure they get the right benefits.",69.65162037037037,8.574989711934158,9.516144504307135,10.569135802469136,10.287345679012349,9.694320987654326,44.11831275720165,4.833333333333333,0.7957868846980009,0.8196081697940827,2.5793190463642737,0.3842789538742743,0.466436219372391,0.0668146029635298,4.584362139917696,4.0,2.438562431649477,20.25,15.5,9.9676560267029,1.3786008230452675,1.0,0.6258121448627845,243,110,0.4526748971193415,1152,12,25.9.0,Claimant stops work during a Work-Sharing agreement,Chapter 25 - Work-Sharing,"There are many reasons why a claimant may not work for an employer while being part of a Work-Sharing unit.
