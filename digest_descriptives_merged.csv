2,2,"Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) is the department of the Government of Canada responsible for developing, managing and delivering programs and services. The Minister of  Employment and Social Development is responsible for the EI act, except for PART IV - Insurable Earnings and Collection of Premiums, and PART VII - Benefit Repayment.The Canada Revenue Agency is responsible for resolving any questions pertaining to the insurability of employment or earnings (Part IV),  and for the collection of EI premiums (Part VII).Service Canada is a federal institution that is part of ESDC. Service Canada oversees all legislative provisions of the act, including the determination of benefit eligibility and entitlement, and issues EI benefits (Part I) directly to EI claimants. Its role is to provide timely and accurate EI benefit payments and services, and to support EI claimants through each stage of the service delivery process. It strives to accurately and efficiently provide benefit information, respond to enquiries, assist employers, process claims and provide the means to request a formal reconsideration of a decision, or to appeal decisions.Provinces and territories deliver the majority of Employment Benefits and National Employment Services (Part II). These benefits and services are delivered through Labour Market Development Agreements (LMDA) funded by the Government of Canada. Through these agreements, Government of Canada funding enables provinces and territories to design, deliver and manage skills and employment programs for unemployed individuals, particularly for those who are eligible for EI benefits.The Canada Employment Insurance Commission (CEIC) is a departmental corporation of  ESDC. It plays a key role in administering the EI program, including the making of regulations, with the approval of the Governor-in-Council, and reviewing, as  well as approving, policies related to the EI program administration and  delivery.

Special benefits include:Maternity benefits: for biological mothers who are pregnant or have given birth. These benefits cover the period surrounding the child's birth (up to 15 weeks).Parental benefits: for any legal parent to care for their newborn or newly adopted child or children. One parent can receive these benefits, or they can share benefits between them (up to 40 weeks of standard parental benefits or 69 weeks of extended parental benefits when sharing).

In addition, the act  provides for the imposition of a violation, depending on the severity of the  false statements, and the individual's personal circumstances (EI Act  7.1(4)).  Once a violation has been  imposed, the claimant may need to work more hours to qualify for EI benefits in  the future.Increased entrance requirements affect all claim types, including claims  for sickness, maternity, parental, compassionate care, family caregiver,  fishing, and self-employment special benefits.There are two types of violations; classified and unclassified. Unclassified violations have no impact on future claims unless there is a further finding of misrepresentation.Classified violations range from minor to subsequent and establish a progressively higher threshold to qualify for benefits - the more serious the  violation, the more hours needed to establish a claim (EIA 7.1(6)).A violation will not be taken into consideration when calculating the number of hours required to establish a  claim when:the Notice of Violation was issued more than 260 weeks  before the date the initial claim was made; ortwo initial claims for benefits have been established since  the date the Notice of Violation was issued (EI Act  7.1(3)).",33.78960352422911,16.602517306482067,17.77360955136429,21.07715544367527,18.79076148521083,13.25709251101322,62.82504719949654,9.857142857142858,2.963945170802336,0.8070010482701216,0.486501203687442,0.0313124891280017,0.7817256351312002,0.7822096943855286,5.096916299559472,4.0,3.1426214830847474,32.42857142857143,25.0,26.070547930332324,1.656387665198238,1.0,1.009204855331198,227,121,0.5330396475770925,1175,7,1.2.3,Increased entrance requirement sanction,Chapter 1 - Basic concepts
14,14,"In order to calculate the regional rates of unemployment, the country has been divided into 62 economic regions. The unemployment rate applicable to each region is determined by Statistics Canada. It is the average of the seasonally adjusted monthly unemployment rate for the last three month period. Regional rates of unemployment are updated every 4 weeks (EI Regulations 17(1.1)(a))The rate that applies to a claimant is the rate assigned to the economic region where the claimant ordinarily resides during the week before their claim starts. If, in this week, the claimant's ordinary place of residence was outside of Canada, the economic region used is the one in which the claimant last worked in insurable employment (EI Regulations 17(1.1)(b)).EI economic regions ensure that people residing in areas of similar levels of unemployment are subject to comparable EI rules in terms of eligibility for benefits and the number of weeks they may receive. Subsection 18(2) of the EI Regulations requires that EI regional boundaries be reviewed every five years to ensure that they reflect current labour market conditions and geographic representation of communities across Canada.When there is an increase in the regional rate of unemployment in a region, the number of hours a claimant needs to qualify for benefits decreases.

15,15,"The expression ordinarily resident is not defined in the legislation. Taking the meaning of the word resident, it refers to  the place in which a claimant has settled (EI Regulations 17(1) and 17(2). The modifier ordinarily clearly excludes from the definition, any location in a place in which a person has no permanent  residence, or places where a person only occasionally or periodically stays.In the case of a married person who is frequently employed away from home, the ordinary residence of that person is the place in which the spouse  and children reside. For an individual who lives alone or has no  family obligations, the place in which that individual has settled is the place  of ordinary residence; any stay in other locations, even of lengthy duration, does not change this. Therefore, the claimant's stated residence is not always  regarded as the ordinary residence (CUB 66347; CUB 69769).A change in residence normally occurs when a person leaves an area with the intention of settling permanently elsewhere and takes along all personal  belongings. Sometimes, even the place in which the person temporarily resides  before settling permanently may be regarded as the ordinary residence.When a claimant's residential and mailing addresses differ, the applicable economic region is the address of the residence.",47.70690924657535,13.405884703196346,15.742502247213078,18.07328767123288,15.78599315068493,12.49187214611872,57.51198630136986,8.25,3.1481453030248945,0.658283234863634,0.44379230163057,0.0123535626788807,0.9092711806297302,0.9235429565111796,4.995433789954338,4.0,2.894645847684268,27.375,27.5,10.487343562599635,1.552511415525114,1.0,0.9069647275351858,219,111,0.5068493150684932,1114,8,1.2.5,Ordinary residence,Chapter 1 - Basic concepts

19,19,"Claimants must work a minimum number of insurable hours in their qualifying period to be eligible for benefits. Claimants who were prevented from working in insurable employment, due to one of several grounds, during any week of their qualifying period, may have their qualifying period extended.  An extension cannot be granted for any week during which one of these grounds applied, if the claimant was in receipt of EI benefits or Quebec Parental Insurance Plan benefits for that same week.An extension of the qualifying period can make the difference between whether or not a claimant has sufficient insurable hours to qualify, and can affect the number of weeks of benefits a claimant may receive. An extension of the qualifying period may also allow a claimant to qualify to receive special benefits.There are four grounds under which the qualifying period may be extended. It is the  claimant's responsibility to show that one of these grounds applies in their particular case (EI Act 8(2)).The qualifying period may never be extended beyond the start date of any prior benefit period (EI Act  8(1)(b)), and the extended qualifying period may not exceed 104 weeks in total (EI Act  8(7)).",45.20044554455447,14.123691654879774,16.084390811093357,18.671570014144272,15.825749646393213,11.671881188118814,58.06506364922207,8.428571428571429,3.319510108983793,0.5942040798754693,0.4398210450842029,0.0494688800141218,0.8821382621924082,0.8688800930976868,4.846534653465347,4.0,2.675746008918762,28.857142857142858,29.0,13.912261513074114,1.5643564356435644,1.0,0.9110525039935076,202,94,0.4653465346534653,997,7,1.3.0,Extension of qualifying period,Chapter 1 - Basic concepts

This could mean that the charges were later withdrawn,  or the claimant was in fact found not guilty, and therefore not convicted (EI Act  8(2)(b)).To qualify for this extension the claimant must provide a letter from the institution in which they were incarcerated, to prove the actual dates of incarceration.

23,23,"The purpose of this ground for extension is to disregard the period of time during  which a person attends a course that was referred by the Commission or its designated  authority (EI Act  8(2)(c)).  This allows for insured  hours in the extended portion of the qualifying period to be added to the hours  in the qualifying period, which may otherwise not be sufficient to establish a  benefit period.For example, a claimant who requires 700 hours of insurable employment, and was employed in insurable employment for 580 hours in their qualifying period, would not have sufficient hours to establish a benefit period.  If, during their qualifying period, this claimant had taken a ten-month training course, approved by a designated authority, while receiving a training allowance, the qualifying period would be extended by ten months.  Any hours worked during the extended qualifying period would be added to the 580 already worked, which could potentially allow the claimant to establish a benefit period.It must be kept in mind that claimants who have been referred to a course or other employment related activity and who are in receipt of Part I benefits (i.e. EI benefits) are not eligible for an extension of the qualifying period. In the above example, as the person was in receipt of a training allowance and did not receive EI benefits, an extension could be granted.The period for which the extension applies starts from the week the claimant actually started the course, or other employment activity.

29,29,"The start date of a claim is commonly referred to as the Benefit Period Commencement date or the BPC. The act states that the start date of a claim begins on the Sunday of the week in which the interruption of earnings occurs, or on the Sunday of the week in which the initial claim for benefits is made, whichever is later (EI Act 10).The interruption of earnings is discussed in depth in Digest Chapter 2. In short, the interruption of earnings requires a termination of employment and a period of seven consecutive days without work or earnings, from that employment (CUB 71217). Once it is established that an interruption of earnings exists, the start date of a claim can be determined.A strict application of EI Act 10 would mean that in most situations the claim would start the week the claimant filed their application for benefits. Therefore, for administrative purposes, the Commission developed a policy that is used to determine the start date of a claim. The Administrative Policy is only applied when it is to the claimant's advantage (Digest 3.1.1).When a claimant files an application for benefits more than four calendar weeks after the week in which the interruption of earnings occurs, the effective date of the claim will be the Sunday of the week in which the claimant filed the application. A claimant wishing to have their claim start on an earlier date must request an antedate (Digest Chapter 3).Only insurable hours accumulated prior to the start week of the benefit period can be used in determining whether a claimant qualifies, or in the calculation of the number of weeks of benefits that could be payable. Hours worked during a benefit period cannot be used. In this context, if a claimant had hours of insurable employment during the week the interruption of earnings occurred, and without those hours a benefit period could not be established, the start date of the claim can be deferred to the following Sunday.",51.85171621621623,14.299702702702708,14.69652957618502,18.244924924924927,17.666756756756754,11.333813813813808,57.92462462462462,8.2,3.327928585942492,0.820252529363298,0.4719863488121859,0.0565952841826827,0.8899322085910373,0.8932648301124573,4.7657657657657655,4.0,2.8641565218700884,33.3,26.5,17.059015211904818,1.4324324324324325,1.0,0.8555238806132116,333,123,0.3693693693693693,1616,10,1.4.1,Effective date of a benefit period,Chapter 1 - Basic concepts

31,31,"It must be remembered that the information in this section refers to regular benefits. Other types of benefits, such as sickness, maternity, parental, compassionate care or family caregiver benefits, are subject to their own specific legislative provisions, and are discussed in depth in their own chapters of this Digest. Fishing benefits and payments related to developmental programs (training, work-sharing), will also be discussed in other chapters.In a benefit period, benefits may be payable for every week of unemployment (EI Act 9) that follows the waiting period (EI Act 13; Digest 1.8).The maximum number of weeks for which benefits may be paid in a benefit period is determined at the time the benefit period is established and is dependent on two factors.A claimant can receive from 14 weeks up to a maximum of 45 weeks of regular benefits, depending on:the unemployment rate in the region in which they ordinarily reside, at the time the claim was established, andthe amount of insurable employment they have accumulated in the 52 weeks preceding their claim, or since their last claim, whichever is shorter (EI Act 12(2)).For example, when the applicable regional rate of unemployment is 6%, and a claimant has accumulated 700 hours of insurable employment in the last 52 weeks, then a maximum of 14 weeks of benefits may be payable.Whereas another claimant who had 1330 hours of insurable employment and resides in a region where the applicable rate of unemployment is greater than 16%, could receive up to 45 weeks of benefits.

32,32,"The EI Regulations provide that, under certain circumstances, a claimant  who resides outside of Canada is not disentitled from benefits solely for that  reason. However, the number of weeks of benefits which may be paid in these  circumstances is subject to different rules than a claimant residing in Canada.A claimant, permanently or temporarily residing in a state of the United  States that shares a border with Canada, may be entitled to benefits, provided  they are available for work in Canada and are able to report in person to a  Service Canada Centre, if or  when  directed  to do so (EI Regulation 55(6)(a)). Individuals  who reside temporarily or permanently in the District of Columbia, in any of  the United States, the Virgin Islands, or Puerto Rico, and prove they meet all conditions  of entitlement to benefits under an agreement between Canada and the United  States, can receive benefits (EI Regulation 55(6)(b)).In either situation, the maximum number of weeks of benefits that may be  paid in a benefit period is dependent on the number of hours of insurable  employment accumulated in the qualifying period. EI  Regulation 55 (7) contains a table that shows the various maximum weeks of  benefits which could be paid, and corresponding number of insurable hours required.A claimant residing outside of Canada under one of the situations  described above, and for whom a benefit period was established, could eventually move to Canada during the course of their benefit period. The maximum number of weeks that claimant could continue to receive would be the number provided in the table mentioned above (EI Regulation 55(8)).The opposite may also occur: that is, a claimant who had established a benefit period in Canada could subsequently reside outside of Canada, under the conditions mentioned earlier. The maximum number of weeks for which benefits may be paid to that claimant during the benefit period is the higher of:the number of weeks for which benefits have already been received in Canada, or,if they had permanently or temporarily resided outside of Canada in one of the locations mentioned above when their benefit period was established, the number of weeks they would have been entitled to pursuant to the table in EI Regulation 55(7); (EI  Regulation 55(7)).",31.92653061224493,20.97918367346939,18.243605946275583,25.31428571428572,25.766913265306123,11.93091836734694,75.78571428571428,13.125,4.380558536610282,1.028938231899538,0.4956183649991373,0.056394985115464,0.931448187146868,0.9233996272087096,4.8188775510204085,4.0,2.872343629126181,49.0,42.5,23.02715787933891,1.479591836734694,1.0,0.8296740426674913,392,139,0.3545918367346938,1913,8,1.4.3.1,Number of weeks of benefits payable to commuter and interstate claimants,Chapter 1 - Basic concepts
33,33,"As  discussed earlier, the maximum number of weeks of regular benefits that may be  paid in a benefit period will vary from 14 to 45 (Digest  1.4.2; EI Act 12(2)). The length of the benefit period itself is 52 weeks (EI Act  10(2)), which includes the waiting period (EI Act 13),  during which no benefits are payable.No further  entitlement exists once these 52 weeks, or in the case of an extension,  104 weeks, have passed (EI Act  10(8); CUB  76507), even if the claimant has not received the maximum number of weeks payable.A  benefit period technically terminates after the claimant has received all weeks  of regular benefits to which they are entitled. However, where all those regular  benefits are paid before the end of 52 weeks, for example after  19 weeks, the benefit period will not be terminated immediately, as the  claimant may become eligible to receive special benefits (sickness, maternity, parental, etc) (EI Act  12(6)).In such a case where special benefits are claimed after all regular benefits have been paid, the benefit period will terminate at the earlier of the following eventualities:when both regular and special  benefits have been paid to a maximum of 50 weeks orwhen the 52nd week of the  benefit period has been reached (EI Act  10(8)).Once the benefit period has terminated, it is up to the claimant to demonstrate that they meet the conditions required to establish a new benefit period.",30.891237354085632,21.719813229571987,18.878054631974784,26.47439688715953,25.382529182879374,9.981167315175096,77.47003891050583,13.4,3.4241021213692022,0.469233260661959,0.4236156926840156,0.014041328207847,0.8872215747833252,0.8239773313204447,4.482490272373541,4.0,2.5856316587650485,51.4,33.0,40.7656718330509,1.4630350194552528,1.0,0.7838318346923272,257,113,0.4396887159533074,1173,5,1.4.4,Termination of a benefit period,Chapter 1 - Basic concepts
34,34,"A claimant may request early termination of the benefit period for the purpose of establishing a new one immediately. This course of action may be  advantageous when, for example, the new benefit rate could be higher or the  claimant could become major attached (Digest 1.2.8 ),  and therefore be entitled to special benefits.Where a claimant requests early termination of their benefit period, in order to allow them to make an informed decision, the Commission must inform  them of the advantages and disadvantages related to such a termination, and  also of the finality of this decision (FCA  434-10; CUB  75288). The Commission cannot decide for the claimant, nor influence their decision.  This decision must be made by the claimant and is final, even though it may  later turn out to be disadvantageous to the claimant. What may be advantageous  at one point in time could be different in the future.Where the claimant requests an early termination of the benefit period, the request will be granted, provided the claimant makes an application for a  new initial claim and qualifies to establish a new benefit period (EI Act  10(8)(d)). In such case, the benefit period is terminated effective the  Saturday preceding the start date of the new benefit period. If no benefits  were paid or payable during the part of the benefit period that was terminated,  then the benefit period may be cancelled (EI Act  10(6)(a)).As is the case with initial and other claims, a request to terminate a benefit period must be made within a reasonable period. A late request to  terminate an established benefit period is considered to have been made at an  earlier date if the claimant shows that good cause existed for the entire  period of delay in making the request. It is irrelevant whether the benefit  period has since terminated or not (EI Act  10(9)). Furthermore, it is irrelevant whether benefits have been paid after  the date of early termination. In such a case, an adjustment in the payment of  benefits will be made. As well, if no benefits were paid in the portion of the  benefit period which is prior to the date of the early termination, the earlier  benefit period may be cancelled (EI Act  10(6)(a)).In order to determine whether the claimant's reasons for delay constitute good cause, the principles concerning antedating, as found in Digest  Chapter 3, are to be followed. Jurisprudence has held that good cause  is simply doing what a reasonable person would do to satisfy themselves as to  their rights and obligations under the act.(FCA  A-154-11; CUB  76454).Any week of definite disqualification which had not been served when the benefit period terminated, will be carried forward to the new benefit period, unless  two years have passed since the date of the original disqualifying event (EI  Act 28(3)). No week of disqualification will be carried forward to a subsequent  benefit period if the claimant, since the date of this event, has accumulated 700  hours of insurable employment (EI  Act 28(4)). Furthermore, the disqualification will be deferred (EI  Act 28(5)) for any weeks during which special benefits are payable. Further  details on the effects of a disqualification are found at Digest  1.6.2.",49.95014287031066,13.758197068854273,14.703951732595929,17.485150705134114,15.331604756198727,10.34956217162872,55.44667711309798,7.631578947368421,3.3898121388174376,0.8465726269224365,0.4314924152020206,0.0498421934237485,0.8385126458273994,0.8388898863511927,4.614711033274956,4.0,2.9595156356081165,30.05263157894737,25.0,14.855350566150005,1.4938704028021017,1.0,0.8963132763348781,571,209,0.3660245183887916,2666,19,1.4.5,Early termination,Chapter 1 - Basic concepts
35,35,"Under very specific conditions, a benefit period can be cancelled or voluntarily terminated before all weeks of entitlement have been paid, or before the 52 week duration of the benefit period has expired.A cancelled claim is considered to have never begun (EI Act  10(7)). The Act allows for a claim to be cancelled when:no benefits have been paid or payable; the claimant requests a cancellation; and the claimant can establish a new benefit period effective the first week for which benefits (on the former claim) were  paid or payable. Where a claimant requests cancellation of their benefit period, in order  to allow them to make an informed decision, the Commission must inform them of  the advantages and disadvantages related to such a cancellation, and also of the finality of their decision.  The claimant must not be influenced one way or the other, as it is the claimant who  must decide what action to take.Often, it is to the claimant's advantage to cancel an earlier benefit  period, as it may result in a longer qualifying period (Digest 1.2.1), or a more advantageous start date for a new benefit period.The Commission may, without discussing with the claimant, cancel a  benefit period that has terminated, provided that no benefits were paid or payable  in that benefit period (EI Act 10(6)(a)).At the claimant's request, the Commission may also cancel a portion of a benefit period which precedes the first week for which benefits were paid or  payable, provided the following two conditions are met:the claimant establishes a new  benefit period commencing the first week for which benefits were paid or  payable (on the previous claim), and,the claimant shows good cause  for any delay in requesting cancellation, throughout the entire period from the day benefits  were first paid or payable and the day the request was made.It is irrelevant whether or not the benefit period that the claimant is requesting be cancelled has terminated (EI Act 10(6)(b)).Where a claimant requests cancellation of a portion of their benefit period, in order to allow them to make an informed decision, the Commission must inform the claimant of the advantages and  disadvantages related to such a cancellation. These requests should be treated  in the same manner as requests for early termination (Digest 1.4.4), that is, the claimant must  not be influenced and it is entirely up to the claimant to decide what action to take.It may happen that benefits were paid during a benefit period, although they were not payable and the resulting overpayment must now be reimbursed. In  such a case a request for cancellation of that benefit period may be granted,  as benefits would no longer be considered to have been paid or payable.The expression benefits paid also includes some situations where the claimant did not in fact receive benefits, for example, when a disqualification was being served (Digest  1.9.6). In such cases, generally, the benefit period cannot be cancelled. There  are exceptions when one or more weeks of disqualification served will not  prevent the cancellation of a claim; for example, this could occur where the  cancellation would permit a minor attachment (less than 600 hours) claimant to  become a major attachment claimant, and be entitled to sickness, maternity,  parental, compassionate care, and/or family caregiver benefits (EI  Act 28(7)).In the context of the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan, a principle of equivalence exists, that recognizes the similarity of benefits paid under that plan, to maternity or parental benefits paid under the EI program.However, the cancellation of a benefit period is not one of the situations included under the principle of equivalence. Consequently, benefits paid under such a provincial plan are not taken into account when considering termination or cancellation of a benefit period.",35.59530484303218,18.433459992343035,17.410965686947208,22.450574272588057,21.82660222052068,12.001286370597246,68.83700229709035,11.4375,3.729807764585246,0.6697618042112042,0.4111127322068055,0.0718394801494209,0.8611935059229533,0.8648404734475272,4.85145482388974,4.0,2.965496097194655,40.8125,31.5,29.580861105620304,1.5344563552833077,1.0,0.8666659390634959,653,210,0.3215926493108729,3223,16,1.4.6,Cancellation of a benefit period,Chapter 1 - Basic concepts

This could mean that the charges were later withdrawn, or the claimant was in fact found not guilty, and therefore not convicted (EI Act 10(10)(a)).If this condition is met, an extension of the benefit period will be granted, even when other reasons may exist which would not be grounds for extension, no matter the order of  events. For example, a claimant who is on vacation and not available for work for three days would be disentitled for those days, and entitled to two days of benefits. If the claimant is then incarcerated for the balance of the week, no benefits would be payable for that week.

39,39,"When moneys received by reason of a complete severance of the employer-employee relationship are allocated to weeks in a claimant's benefit period, an extension of the benefit  period can be granted (EI Act  10(10)(b)).A complete severance of the employer-employee relationship is considered to occur when the claimant retires, resigns or quits, is fired by the employer, or is laid off and there  is no expectation that they will be recalled (e.g. the Record of Employment  states not returning).Seasonal workers will be considered to have a complete  severance when they are released at the end of the season. However, if there is evidence or knowledge of an on-going contract of employment, then there is no  complete severance of the employer-employee relationship.Where the allocation of moneys prevents payment of benefits for a week, an extension for that week may be allowed.Where the allocation of moneys is for a part week only and no benefits are payable because the claimant is disentitled for the full week, no extension can be granted since the allocation did not prevent, in whole or in part, payment of benefits.Where benefits were payable despite the disentitling condition (i.e. a 2-day disentitlement) and the extension condition prevented payment of those benefits, the extension would be granted for that week.",29.1755,20.319499999999994,19.287186520377343,25.062857142857144,23.99433035714285,12.28303571428571,77.3892857142857,14.6,3.396478035264113,0.5131818552380012,0.4714518517701879,0.0416874206400346,0.928474262356758,0.9320183793703716,4.888392857142857,4.0,3.091036740541521,44.8,30.0,30.63592662218657,1.5625,1.0,0.9041694096952028,224,98,0.4375,1116,5,1.5.1.2,Earnings due to complete severance from employer,Chapter 1 - Basic concepts
40,40,"A claimant may have the benefit period extended if they were in receipt  of Workers' Compensation payments for an illness or injury (EI Act  10(10)(c)). This includes all Workers' Compensation payments (e.g.  rehabilitation, training, etc.) other than a permanent settlement of workers' compensation  payments.Weeks counted for the extension are those where the earnings completely prevented  the payment of EI benefits, or prevented the claimant from serving the waiting  period. Workers' compensation payments are deducted based on the type of benefits being claimed.A disability pension or permanent settlement of workers' compensation  payment is not considered earnings and does not prevent the payment of EI benefits. Therefore, in such case, it would not allow for an extension. It should also be noted that payments under a wage-loss plan, an employer's disability plan, or  payments for a motor vehicle accident under the Quebec motor vehicle accident  insurance are not considered workers' compensation payments due to an illness  or injury. They therefore do not allow for the extension of the benefit period.It is possible that a person who had suffered an injury at work may be denied EI benefits for two reasons. This would be the case for a minor attachment claimant (has less than 600 hours of insurable employment in their qualifying period) who has stopped work because of an injury, and was receiving workers' compensation payments which also prevented the payment of EI benefits. The receipt of the worker's compensation payments allows for extension, but the fact that they had insufficient hours to qualify for benefits, does not. In such a case the extension may be granted since the claimant only has to meet one of the grounds for extension, regardless of what occurred before or during the existence of that reason.

As well, an event may occur twice, when, for example, the claimant, without good cause, refuses two distinct opportunities for suitable employment.

51,51,"A disqualification is expressed in terms of a number of complete weeks, which may vary depending on the circumstances of a particular case (EI  Act 30(2)). A week of an indefinite disqualification (duration of the benefit period) can only be served after the waiting period has been served (EI  Act 28(2)).In the case of definite disqualifications (specific number of weeks) (EI  Act 27(1), EI Act 28(1), when one or more are imposed, the number of weeks of each disqualification are added together and this is the number of weeks of  disqualification that must be served. These disqualifications are only served  following the waiting period and during a week for which benefits would  otherwise be payable (EI Act 28(2). The number of weeks of benefits payable in a benefit period will  be reduced by each week of definite disqualification served (EI Act 28(6); Digest 1.5.5 ).Weeks of disqualification can start to be served as of the week in which the event resulting in the disqualification occurred, if benefits would  otherwise have been payable. If benefits have already been paid for any weeks  of disqualification, the claimant will be required to repay the benefits received (EI Act 43).",32.336097560975645,18.934634146341462,17.122413403193683,22.25365853658537,21.42526829268292,11.38653658536585,62.95121951219512,9.0,3.171443137878066,0.5070299507649906,0.4574129985698395,0.0477045349655883,0.918397843837738,0.9022914171218872,4.746341463414634,4.0,3.4759169740130456,41.0,27.0,19.462785001124583,1.5707317073170732,1.0,1.2061314700898025,205,88,0.4292682926829268,994,5,1.6.2,Effect of disqualification,Chapter 1 - Basic concepts
52,52,"When a claimant who has been disqualified from benefits proves entitlement to special benefits, the disqualification is suspended in order to allow those benefits. Once the claimant is no longer entitled to special benefits, or when all weeks of  special benefits have been paid, the disqualification is reinstated (EI Act 28(5); EI Act 30(4)).Thus, in the case of a claimant who is disqualified from benefits, and who qualifies to receive benefits due to pregnancy, caring for a newborn child, adoption,  sickness, injury or quarantine, or to provide care or support to a family  member with a serious medical condition, the payment of benefits will be  treated as if there was no disqualification. Any week of disqualification not  served will be postponed, until the claimant is no longer entitled to special  benefits. The serving of a disqualification is also deferred when a claimant is  attending a course or employment activity to which they were referred by the Commission or a designated authority (EI Act 28(5)).",29.370065789473728,19.78308479532164,18.7741,24.117543859649125,23.026754385964917,12.323040935672513,74.91374269005848,13.75,3.426431368381198,0.7945221481009113,0.4738353266266569,0.0201911937537141,0.8780303200085958,0.893882691860199,4.900584795321637,4.0,3.4073449572965795,42.75,29.0,28.83899270085556,1.5847953216374269,1.0,1.0909528745463926,171,89,0.52046783625731,853,4,1.6.3,Disqualifications and the payment of special benefits,Chapter 1 - Basic concepts
53,53,"Quite often both a disqualification and a disentitlement may be imposed at the same time in relation to the same action. For example, a claimant who  voluntarily quits employment to attend training that was not referred by the  Commission or a designated authority could be subject to a disqualification for  quitting without just cause, and a disentitlement for failing to prove  availability for work. Although the disqualification by itself would prevent  the payment of benefits, a decision must also be rendered regarding the claimant's  availability for work (FCA  A-1692-92;EI Act 49(1)(b)).Once a disentitlement completely prevents the payment of regular benefits, a disqualification cannot be served for the same week. The same applies if other reasons prevent the payment of benefits for a week, such as an allocation of earnings; that week cannot be used to serve the disqualification. On the other hand,  if a disentitlement or an allocation of earnings still allows for at least one dollar to be paid, this week can count as a week of disqualification served  (Digest 1.5.5).In the case of a definite disqualification (specific number of weeks), any weeks that have  not been served by the end of the benefit period will automatically be carried  forward to any new benefit period in the two years following the date the  original disqualifying event occurred (EI Act 28(3)). Weeks of disqualification will not be carried  forward if the claimant has accumulated at least 700 hours of insurable  employment, since the event that led to the disqualification (EI Act 28(4)). All hours of insurable employment  accumulated since the disqualifying event will count towards the 700, regardless of whether the hours are from employment the claimant left voluntarily without just cause, or from which they were dismissed due to  misconduct.In the case of indefinite disqualifications (for the entire benefit period), no disqualification will be carried forward. If, since the disqualifying event, the claimant has worked the minimum number of hours required to establish a  benefit period, the new benefit period will be established (EI  Act 30(1)(a)). However, the  hours from any employment the claimant lost due to misconduct or left without just cause, will not be used in the calculation of the benefit rate or the number of weeks of entitlement on the new  claim. All other hours of employment in the qualifying period, either prior to  or since the disqualifying event, will be used in the calculation (EI Act 30(6)). Thus, even though the claimant may qualify for benefits, the rate and duration will be affected by the disqualified employment.",35.02893456375841,17.627432885906035,17.02489783603662,21.25346756152125,20.186543624161075,12.108187919463084,63.64821029082774,9.833333333333334,3.397901580095107,0.5028379115966548,0.4565013933888566,0.0588134073003386,0.9127007560296492,0.9192734897136688,4.881431767337808,4.0,3.398484951190031,37.25,32.5,18.33996092325899,1.5838926174496644,1.0,1.147513630460723,447,167,0.3736017897091722,2216,12,1.6.4,Disqualification and disentitlement - same event,Chapter 1 - Basic concepts
54,54,"The event that leads to a disqualification determines the length of the disqualification, and whether it is definite (set number of weeks) or indefinite (for the entire benefit period).A disqualification for voluntary leaving employment or due to the claimant's misconduct will be for an indefinite number of weeks; that is, for the duration  of the benefit period (EI Act  30(2)). A disqualification for refusal of employment, or for not taking  advantage of a suitable employment opportunity will be from 7 to 12 weeks (EI  Act 28(1)(a)), and for failure to follow directions of the Commission  or designated authority to attend an interview or follow a course, the  disqualification will be from 1 to 6 weeks (EI Act 28(1)(b)).When it is determined that a definite disqualification is warranted, the next step is to determine the exact number of weeks of disqualification, taking into account all the facts, including any extenuating circumstances in a given case. While the legislation provides for maximum penalties in the above situations, these are usually only applied in the most serious cases. Most disqualifications should fall somewhere between the ranges of 7 to 12 weeks, or 1 to 6 weeks.The legislation clearly establishes, however, that in the case of voluntary leaving and dismissal due to misconduct there is no discretion regarding the length of disqualification.  It applies for each week of the benefit period (EI Act 30(2)).

56,56,"In cases where a claimant has been offered, but refused suitable employment that is only expected to last a short time, the disqualification should not exceed the number of weeks the employment would have lasted. However, as the minimum weeks of disqualification for this reason is seven, when a disqualification applies, and the duration of the offered employment is seven weeks or less, the minimum of seven weeks will be imposed.

When a  disentitlement covers a full week, it will delay the payment of benefits, and  will not reduce the maximum number of weeks that could potentially be paid in  the claimant's benefit period. However, once the benefit period terminates (52  weeks plus any extensions is reached), no further benefits can be paid in that benefit period (Digest 1.4.4).

This applies to claims  where a claimant experienced an interruption of earnings from employment, pursuant to EI Regulation 14(2) (special benefits), and was paid sick leave pay from the same employer, after they  stopped working (EI Regulation 40(6)).Waiving of the waiting period does not provide the claimant with an extra week of benefits.

In  this situation the waiting period must be served by the first parent/family  member to make a claim.

82,82,"The EI working while on claim provisions allow claimants to stay connected to the labour market and earn additional income while on claim. The provisions allow claimants to keep receiving a portion of their EI benefits, along with all earnings from employment or other sources. Claimants who meet certain criteria have a choice of two options regarding how earnings are deducted from benefits. These provisions apply to any eligible EI claimant who earns money while collecting any type of EI benefits.  However, for weeks of sickness and maternity benefits claimed, the provisions only apply to weeks of benefits payable on or after August 12, 2018.Default earnings rule:Once the waiting period has been served, claimants can keep 50 cents of EI benefits for every dollar earned or received while on claim, until their earnings reach 90% of the weekly earnings used to establish their claim. Any earnings above this cap are deducted dollar-for-dollar from benefits. This method is the default rule that automatically applies to all eligible claims.Transitional Measure:Under the working while on claim provisions of Pilot  Project 20, which were in effect from August 7, 2016 to August 11, 2018,  claimants had the option to revert to the provisions of an earlier pilot  project (Pilot  Project 17). Pilot project 17 allowed that, once the waiting period was  served, claimants could earn the higher of $75 or 40% of their weekly benefit  rate each week, before any deductions were made from their benefits. Any amount  earned that exceeded this amount was deducted dollar-for-dollar from benefits.Claimants who chose to revert during Pilot Project 20 will continue to have this second option for a period of up to three years (until August 2021).The option to revert to Pilot Project 17 does not apply to claimants in receipt of sickness, maternity, or special benefits for the self-employed, unless they had previously reverted a non-sickness, maternity or self-employment claim. This is because they did not previously have this option on self-employment claims, and therefore would not meet the requirement of having reverted on a claim during the period covered by Pilot Project 20.The default method of treating earnings while on claim applies to self-employment claims, as well as claims where the claimant is outside Canada.Claimants who are eligible to choose the alternate option are strongly encouraged to make the choice near the end of their claim in order to have more complete information about their specific circumstances and work pattern. This will make it easier to determine which option would be more beneficial for them. Once the claimant has made their decision to revert a claim, the decision is final and cannot be reversed, regardless of the final impact on the payment of benefits. Decisions made by the Commission regarding requests to revert a claim are not subject or formal reconsideration or appeal.Earnings to be deducted from benefits are always rounded to the nearest  dollar. A fraction that is less than one-half is disregarded, and a fraction  equal to or greater than one-half is taken as a dollar. For example, for a benefit  rate of $300, earnings of $82.50 would result in a deduction of $41, reducing  the benefits payable to $259.Detailed information about the working while on claim provisions is  available on the Government of Canada  website.In the context of the Quebec Parental Insurance Program EI maternity or parental benefits are reduced by the amount of any benefits paid or payable under the  provincial plan.Thus, an amount equal to the amount of QPIP provincial benefits a person  has received or is entitled to receive, will be deducted in full from EI  maternity or parental benefits for which the person may be eligible (EI  Regulation 76.09(2)).When a claimant is referred to a course or program of instruction or training by the  Commission or a designated authority, earnings or allowances received under  employment benefits (EI Act  19(4)) are not deducted from benefits, except in accordance with the EI  Regulations (EI Regulation 16(1))When the claimant is attending a course or program of instruction to which they were  not referred, the total of any allowances paid for attending that course are  deducted (EI  Regulation 16(1)). However any allowances paid for dependent care, travel,  commuting, living away from home or disability are not deducted (EI Regulation 16(2)).There will be cases where the claimant attends a training course and is  paid employment benefits (Part II) because they did not have an interruption of  earnings, they didn't qualify for EI benefits (Part I), or because they were  disentitled from benefits. If a claimant in one of these situations subsequently  qualifies for EI benefits for those same weeks, the total of the earnings or  allowances paid under Part II as employment benefits will be deducted from EI  benefits (EI  Regulation 16(3)). For this regulation to apply all three conditions  therein must be present:the claimant originally did not have an interruption of earnings or qualify for EI benefits,was paid employment benefits for attending a course or program of instruction or training, andsubsequently became entitled to EI benefits for  those same weeks.Earnings  arising from a job not related to the course or employment activity continue to  be deducted from benefits (EI  Regulations 35 and 36).",42.61821747572817,16.5266476806904,16.404322709996244,20.6572427184466,19.76576051779936,11.685350593311757,65.34321467098167,10.48,3.152581916620097,0.8320546333317778,0.4831685924789083,0.0420144515827953,0.8414069265127182,0.8126017995502638,4.810140237324704,4.0,2.815158666764729,37.08,30.0,25.136300443780502,1.4962243797195254,1.0,0.7935397091778653,927,298,0.3214670981661273,4524,25,1.9.7,Earnings while on claim,Chapter 1 - Basic concepts

84,84,"Often times an employer may be experiencing financial difficulties and  is on the verge of bankruptcy or receivership. In these situations, if a  claimant has filed a complaint with the provincial labour authorities for unpaid  wages owing for work performed, those unpaid wages and hours of work will be  used to establish their claim for benefits (EI  Regulation 9.1).In these situations, CRA gives the claimant credit for the unpaid  portion of earnings. This provision applies to unpaid wages only. Termination  monies or overtime owed to the claimant, but not paid by the employer, are not  included in the determination of unpaid insurable earnings.Unpaid wages that fall into the calculation period are taken into consideration when determining the benefit rate. Also,  hours of work related to these unpaid wages are included in the total hours of  insurable employment used to establish a benefit period, and for determining  the number of weeks of benefits potentially payable (EI  Regulation 19(6)).",44.20960784313729,14.131764705882354,15.247664890283003,17.68627450980392,15.926490196078433,12.105647058823532,54.80392156862745,7.5,3.057305635376756,0.995948704677646,0.4752155172413793,0.0357124056396034,0.8594723582267761,0.8588029444217682,4.923529411764706,4.0,3.025388533485693,28.33333333333333,22.5,17.336538165261125,1.5823529411764703,1.0,0.9620659718834544,170,91,0.5352941176470588,842,6,1.9.9,Unpaid wages,Chapter 1 - Basic concepts
85,85,"It is not unusual for an insured person to claim more than one type of benefits during a single benefit period. This makes it somewhat more complicated to determine the number of weeks of benefits they may receive. In this respect, it is necessary to understand the specific limits, on the maximum number of weeks of benefits payable, and on the duration of the benefit period, depending on the types of benefits claimed.Where a person makes a claim for various types of benefits during a single benefit period and fulfills all entitlement conditions, it then becomes necessary to determine whether these benefits can be paid within that benefit period. The number and type of benefits already received, the type of benefits claimed and the time elapsed since the beginning of the benefit period, are all factors that must be considered.There are several types of benefits that are paid while a claimant is participating in a developmental program. When the person is employed under a  work-sharing agreement, the benefit period is extended by the number of weeks  that the person is employed in work-sharing while claiming benefits (EI Regulation 45)).However, when a person is participating in a job creation partnership, is attending a training course to which they have been referred by an authority designated by the  Commission, or is employed under an approved self-employment agreement, there  is no legislative provision to extend the benefit period. In these situations,  when the benefit period terminates, the person may then receive financial  assistance under the employment benefits provisions (Part II  of the EI Act).",36.156366758241774,16.69384157509157,17.693802365651003,21.269047619047623,18.854697802197805,12.323369963369965,65.26053113553114,10.625,3.202428458194712,0.4911562981261671,0.4516927957233684,0.0420793577295645,0.8895783509526934,0.8803538978099823,4.930402930402931,4.0,2.8359787191589696,34.125,30.0,20.49047034599255,1.608058608058608,1.0,0.8792734910270927,273,120,0.4395604395604395,1367,8,1.9.10,Claim for more than one type of benefits,Chapter 1 - Basic concepts
86,86,"The Employment Insurance (EI) Act (the act) sets up an insurance scheme to protect against the loss of income resulting from unemployment. The purpose of the scheme is to compensate unemployed persons for a loss; it is not to pay benefits to those who have not experienced any loss (FCA A-263-78, CUB 55181). That loss is legally referred to as an interruption of earnings (EI Act 2(1)).

89,89,"Generally, the proof required to support that an interruption of  earnings has occurred is the record of employment (ROE).  Employers are required to complete a ROE for  an insured person when they have an interruption of earnings (EI  Regulation 19(2)). It is usually considered that a claimant who does not  submit their ROE has not proven that an interruption of earnings has occurred. However,  it will be accepted that an interruption of earnings has occurred if the  claimant can show that they have made reasonable efforts to obtain the ROE but the  employer has failed to issue it at the proper time. The timeframes within which  the employer must issue the ROE are outlined in regulation  19(3)(a) and (19)(3.1).An employer may have issued the ROE for the insured person prior to the  end of the seven-day interruption of earnings period. When the Commission  becomes aware, before the benefit period is established, that the claimant has  returned to work for the same employer before the end of the seven day break,  the Commission will not establish a benefit period, as legally, an interruption  of earnings has not occurred.However, where the Commission becomes aware, after the benefit period  has been established, that the claimant returned to work for the same employer  before the end of the seven day break, the Commission will only reconsider the  decision to establish the benefit period, if there is evidence that the  employer knew the claimant would be returning to work within seven days, when  they issued the ROE.The purpose of this policy is to prevent the voiding of a claim because  there was no interruption of earnings in situations where the employer issued  the ROE believing that the person would be off work for seven or more days, but  was called back unexpectedly.",36.66052795031058,19.57360248447205,16.26309291913925,22.996273291925466,23.18919254658385,10.54608695652174,71.15527950310559,11.571428571428571,3.8933676766064735,0.4754775541777278,0.4365587308139426,0.0420876805022876,0.8877148727575938,0.8353710532188415,4.590062111801243,4.0,2.761699111728098,46.0,42.0,31.67694068922331,1.4596273291925466,1.0,0.7761490285587029,322,118,0.3664596273291925,1484,7,2.1.3,Proof,Chapter 2 - Interruption of earnings

91,91,"A lay-off or separation occurs when the employee is in fact laid off or  dismissed, or when the employee resigns from  employment. A lay-off or separation is also considered to occur when an  employee:is temporarily suspended without pay from employment by reason of misconduct temporarily ceases to work, voluntarily or not, by reason of a labour disputetakes a leave of absence without pay while remaining under contract ceases to work by reason of a general vacation period but only from the last day for which vacation pay is paid (EI Regulation 36(8)(a))ceases to be employed by an employer by reason of the business being sold despite the fact that the new owners may have retained the worker's services without interruption has a lay-off or separation from one of two jobs with different employers There may be situations where a person performed the same duties under  identical employment contracts for two separately incorporated franchises of the  same company.  What must be determined is  whether or not the separate franchises are considered the same employer as they  may be considered two independent employers. Similarly, where a claimant works  at two distinct jobs at the same time for the same employer, this constitutes  two separate employments.  As such, an  interruption of earnings occurs when there is a separation from one of  these employments, followed by seven days of no work and no pay. It is not relevant  whether these two employments, held at the same time, are located at the same  or different premises.However, a renewal of an expired contract, promotion to a new job,  transfer to a new job or from one plant to other premises operated by the same  employer would not be considered a lay-off or separation from employment. A judgement on a similar case was found in FCA  A-516-88 which dealt with a reduction of hours in a given week. Such a reduction in hours, and consequently in earnings, does not constitute a lay-off or separation pursuant to the regulation.The initial finding that there was a lay-off or separation from  employment may be later revoked in the case of a claimant who is retroactively reinstated with full pay.There is no cessation of work when a claimant's contract of service  continues, regardless of the amount of compensation received. If the claimant continues to provide essentially the same services as when they were being  fully paid, there is no interruption of earnings (FCA  A-559-89, CUB  17293).",43.871969696969714,16.249090909090906,16.52667757954773,20.666666666666668,18.54792424242424,10.413999999999998,63.48484848484848,9.833333333333334,3.3883797763097405,0.747913920556594,0.4280760259683132,0.075383015454622,0.8495674133300781,0.8516759157180787,4.595454545454546,4.0,3.026395586821704,36.66666666666666,25.5,32.23696980521312,1.4863636363636363,1.0,0.8500243068960145,440,175,0.3977272727272727,2044,12,2.2.1,Lay-off or separation defined,Chapter 2 - Interruption of earnings
92,92,"The seven days without work and without earnings referred to in the  regulations are not fulfilled when the lay-off is intended to be less than  seven calendar days (FCA  A-625-90, CUB  18250, CUB  16277).  As previously mentioned,  there is an exception where an employer issued the ROE based on a  reasonable expectation that the lay-off would be for seven or more days, even  if the claimant returned to work before the seven days (Digest  2.1.3). Work performed for a different employer during the seven-day period  does not prevent the interruption of earnings.A change from full-time to part-time employment is not enough to meet  the seven-day requirement (CUB  66921), unless it results in a break of seven or more consecutive days  without work and without earnings. Continuous part-time employment with duties  performed every week will prevent an interruption of earnings (FCA  A-475-05, CUB  72923 CUB  49383), unless of course there is a period of no work or earnings for seven  or more consecutive days . Equally, there is no interruption of earnings in the  case where a claimant continues to work on the weekends for the same employer,  after being laid-off from full-time employment (CUB  66921).Where the part-time employment is such that the employer only hires the  services of a worker for alternate weeks; that is, one week of normal fulltime  work followed by a week of no work, it is considered that an interruption of  earnings occurs at the end of every week worked.  The determination of whether a claimant in  this situation will in fact receive benefits may be considered under other  provisions of the act.An interruption of earnings does not occur where a claimant is no longer  being paid wages for the off-season but nevertheless continues to perform  certain work, or to have the use of living quarters or board  that amount to earnings (FCA  A-307-06, CUB  65896; FCA  A-963-88, CUB  15703,  FCA  A-559-89; CUB  17293).The concept of the number of hours worked is relevant for specific provisions  of the act and regulations, such as insurability, entitlement conditions, and the  number of weeks of benefits payable.  It  is not, however, relevant to determining if an interruption of earnings occurs.  The definition of days, for the purpose of determining whether an interruption  of earnings occurs is seven complete and consecutive days (from 12 a.m. to  11:59 p.m.) with no work and no earnings.",40.70100000000002,18.910666666666675,15.514038796780548,22.36280701754386,21.8316447368421,9.09535087719298,66.8719298245614,9.7,3.666525407705218,0.6348984274790319,0.4488936724946963,0.0302084186789075,0.9060690138075088,0.90891832113266,4.344298245614035,4.0,2.85041747305525,45.6,41.0,26.54882294942659,1.4166666666666667,1.0,0.8013603200640141,456,173,0.3793859649122807,1998,10,2.2.2,Seven day requirement,Chapter 2 - Interruption of earnings
93,93,"Where services continue to be provided but without remuneration either  in cash, kind or room and board, the question is whether this amounts to  employment. If this is not employment, an interruption of earnings occurs;  otherwise, it cannot be said that the condition of seven days without work has  been met (FCA  A-559-89, CUB  17293; FCA  A-475-05, CUB  64220). In a case where a claimant continued to have use of the employer's  truck, the claimant did not experience an interruption of earnings as it was  considered that he continued to receive benefits from his employer.  It was concluded that the use of the truck was  linked to the work done by the claimant for the employer (CUB  35521).  In a separate case, it was  ruled that a farmer's son who continued with his usual duties on the farm,  without pay but with free room and board did not have an interruption of  earnings. The absence of the payment of wages in this case did not mean that  the claimant was no longer an employee of his father. The employer-employee  relationship continued while the claimant continued in his work (CUB  61718B, CUB  51153). When wages have not been paid for days worked as a result of an employer  declaring bankruptcy, no interruption of earnings occurs until there is a  period of seven days without work (CUB  19081). Whatever recourse an individual may have in such a situation must  be sought under legislation other than the EI program (Provincial Employment  Standards Act).An interruption of earnings was considered not to have occurred in a situation where, in order for a seasonal  employee to be recalled in the active season, one of the conditions was to  occasionally work without pay during the off-season (CUB  14230A).  Other situations where it  was found an interruption of earnings did not occur include a grandmother who  continued to provide the same level of day care to her grandchild, while no longer  being paid  (FCA  A-475-05, CUB  64220); a claimant who was laid off but continued to work for her husband  for approximately ten hours a week, without pay (CUB  49383), and a claimant who worked for a non-profit organization for which  he was paid, then continued to work 35 hours per week, without pay, when the  organization could no longer support his salary (CUB  47937). Generally, employees must work to earn their wages.  Regardless of whether they may at some point,  no longer receive wages while continuing to perform the same work, they are  still considered to be working. There is no stoppage of work, and therefore no  interruption of earnings, when a contract of service continues, even if it is for  little or no pay. These workers continue to provide the same services as had  been provided when receiving full wages, therefore cannot prove an interruption  of earnings (FCA  A-559-89).",55.55484745762712,14.304888888888886,13.867442237049442,18.1524670433145,16.546949152542375,8.67774011299435,57.24557438794727,7.733333333333333,3.371543409654316,0.8955962095150832,0.4400908006426384,0.051425573514193,0.8536472959177834,0.8472415850712702,4.305084745762712,3.0,2.777558802693955,35.4,29.0,21.752547743501985,1.3634651600753296,1.0,0.7700260764355319,531,197,0.3709981167608286,2311,15,2.2.3,Work without earnings,Chapter 2 - Interruption of earnings
94,94,"Generally, it can be said that even though a period of seven days has lapsed  since the last day of work, there is no interruption of earnings if the  claimant receives earnings for any of those seven days; nor will there be one until  there is a period of seven consecutive days without earnings. The earnings to  be taken into account for the determination of whether there is an interruption  of earnings are those specified in  EI  Regulation 35(2).Pay received in respect of a holiday or non-working day or an observed  holiday or non-working day will not prevent an interruption of earnings (EI  Regulation 14(1) and 36(13)).",25.78559322033901,24.320000000000004,,26.989830508474576,28.586440677966102,9.311186440677965,83.57627118644068,14.5,4.491923818707811,0.0654532304725168,0.4492526518804243,0.0066297010607521,0.8388652801513672,,4.3559322033898304,3.0,2.8627515024701577,59.0,59.0,2.0,1.4322033898305084,1.0,0.8384692828563214,118,63,0.5338983050847458,516,2,2.2.4,Earnings without work,Chapter 2 - Interruption of earnings
95,95,"The day on which the interruption of earnings occurs is the day on which  the employee is laid off or separates from employment, provided that day is  followed by seven days without work and without earnings, including Saturdays  and Sundays.  In other words, once a lay  off or other stoppage of work occurs, the interruption of earnings does not  occur at the end of the seven day break in work and earnings, but rather at the  beginning. For example, where an employee is laid off from work on a Friday  after working a full week, the interruption of earnings occurs on the Friday,  as the assumption is that there will be a seven day break.  A benefit period may be reconsidered if it is  later determined that there was not, in fact, seven days without work or  earnings (Digest  2.1.3).",53.55242647058826,15.292205882352942,13.427899808715576,18.69869281045752,17.304607843137255,7.906928104575162,57.20424836601308,7.25,3.54999194068343,0.3108975927373336,0.4568101225016119,0.0371759448534652,0.8824463486671448,0.8703958690166473,4.163398692810458,3.0,2.633265117855269,38.25,40.5,6.098155458825234,1.3529411764705883,1.0,0.6904634063395689,153,71,0.4640522875816993,640,4,2.2.5,Date of the interruption,Chapter 2 - Interruption of earnings

97,97,"When an insured person stops working because of an illness, injury,  quarantine, pregnancy, to care for a new born or child placed for the purpose  of adoption, or to provide care or support to a family member with a serious  medical condition, an interruption of earnings can occur even if the claimant does  not completely stop working or receiving earnings. In these cases, an  interruption of earnings occurs at the beginning of the week in which the  claimant's earnings are reduced by more than 40% of their normal weekly  earnings (EIR  14(2)).In this context, the normal weekly earnings are calculated on the basis  of the regular hourly rate multiplied by the regular hours worked in a week, or  an individual's weekly salary, including overtime worked on a regular basis. When  stopping work due to one of the previously mentioned reasons, the interruption  of earnings  occurs when the individual's   earnings (EI  Regulation 35(2)), including in particular wages or salary, fall below 60% of  their normal weekly earnings.Payments a claimant has received or, should they apply, would be entitled  to receive under a group sickness or disability wage-loss indemnity plan, or  workers' compensation plan, are not earnings to be taken into account when  determining if an interruption of earnings has occurred (EIR  35(4)). What is taken into account, however, are payments a claimant has  received or, should they apply, would be entitled to receive under a paid leave  plan for sickness, maternity, the care of a new born or a child placed for the  purpose of adoption, or for the care of a seriously ill or injured family  member (EI  Regulation 35(2)(c)).Also taken into account are payments a claimant has received or, should  they apply, would be entitled to receive from:a motor vehicle accident  insurance pursuant to a provincial law for an actual or presumed loss of income  from employment , orindemnity payments pursuant to  a provincial law in case of preventive withdrawal of work (EI  Regulation 35(2)(f)).Moneys received as borrowed sick leave against future credits are  earnings. As such, a person who requests and obtains an advance on their sick  leave credits does not have an interruption of earnings until payment stops, as  they continue to be paid.",14.034477611940318,27.946467661691543,18.7741,31.277611940298502,33.87425373134328,10.97880597014925,95.60696517412936,19.166666666666668,4.101137796843177,0.8785198758523748,0.4784234941196382,0.0237823428159673,0.8994304895401001,0.8581817746162415,4.629353233830845,4.0,2.9183642388245064,67.0,57.5,33.71943060017473,1.4751243781094527,1.0,0.7826654988164156,402,164,0.4079601990049751,1882,6,2.3.1,Special benefits,Chapter 2 - Interruption of earnings
98,98,"In some workplaces, employees will regularly work more hours, days or  shifts than that normally worked in a week by individuals employed full-time  elsewhere. Some examples where this type of work schedule could occur would be  isolated work mines or sites, ocean platform drilling rigs or vessels on the  St. Lawrence or Great Lakes, or along the Pacific and Atlantic coasts.Many other workplaces whose operations are continuous may also adopt  similar uninterrupted work patterns. Quite often in these cases employees will  work for 4, 5, 6, or 7 continuous days, following which they have a period of  leave. Another pattern of work that is common is one that allows the employee  to work more hours in a week according to a schedule, and consequently accumulate  a period of leave within an established calendar period.Specific provisions in the contract of employment or the collective  agreement will generally provide the method pursuant to which the period of  leave will be determined. There are two basic methods for determining the  period of leave: one is based on a credit system whereby credits are earned and  accumulated based on the number of hours or days worked, while the other method  is based on an established schedule alternating periods of work and leave.  Whichever method is used, this period of leave does not constitute an  interruption of earnings regardless of whether the period is remunerated (EI  Regulation 14(3); EI Act  11(4)). However should a stoppage of activities occur or if the employee is  laid off or separates from employment, the manner in which the period of leave  is treated may be different.Credits earned and accumulated based on number of hours or days workedWith respect to the accumulated leave credit system, what needs to be  determined when a stoppage of activities or a lay-off or separation occurs is  whether, according to the contract of employment or collective agreement, the  insured person has a right to use up the lay days or accumulated leave credits.  If such is the case, then the interruption of earnings would only occur after all  of the lay days are used up and the period of leave covered by  such accumulated lay days, ends (FCA A-708-92, CUB 20866; FCA A-100-89, CUB 16027; FCA A-762-90, CUB 16027A).Where a person works this type of schedule, a benefit period may be  established if they had a previous interruption of earnings in their qualifying  period.  However, they would not be  considered unemployed in any week in which the period of accumulated leave  falls. Additional information on lay days and other periods of leave can be  found in section  4.3.5 of this digest.However, if the collective agreement or the employment contract  stipulates that the claimant loses those lay days or accumulated leave credits when  the employment or employer's activities stop, the interruption of earnings  occurs at the end of the employment, as there is no longer any entitlement to a  period of leave (FCA  A-220-87, CUB  13443).  Where the claimant is still entitled  to be paid for the lay days, the allocation of earnings would prevent an  interruption of earnings (EI Regulation 36(9)). It is important to keep in mind  that, as the claimant is not entitled to an actual leave period for the lay  days, the provisions of EI Act 11(4) do not come into play. Therefore, a  disentitlement for failing to prove the claimant is unemployed, would not  apply.Established schedule alternating periods of work and leaveWith regard to the pattern of alternating period of work and leave, it  is considered that the established work schedule is interrupted during any  period where the employer's activities are stopped, or when the employment  relationship ends. An interruption of earnings therefore occurs in these  situations, provided that, during the week the activities stop, the employee had  not used any accumulated lay days prior to stopping work. If there were lay days  used, the interruption of earnings will only occur as of the following week.",46.08870055710307,15.749440111420617,15.247664890283003,19.373927576601677,18.141392757660164,10.367799442896937,59.29832869080779,8.4,3.5375017543195746,0.8082528739000164,0.461845040818835,0.0409115162039426,0.8848220549131695,0.8639445636007521,4.590529247910864,4.0,2.930869132239527,35.9,31.5,17.221788525005177,1.4693593314763231,1.0,0.8434789224443666,718,246,0.3426183844011142,3326,20,2.3.2,Lay days or periods of leave,Chapter 2 - Interruption of earnings
99,99,"When the contract of employment provides a period of paid leave to  compensate for additional hours worked from time to time during a period of  employment, there is no interruption of earnings. For example, an employee who occasionally  or regularly works overtime may choose to be compensated with time off rather  than with pay.  The interruption of  earnings in this situation would only occur at the end of the paid time off.In some cases, a claimant may have already had an interruption of  earnings before the compensatory leave, or from other employment held during  the qualifying period.

100,100,"A claimant's contract of employment may provide for payment for a period  longer than a week, regardless of the amount of work completed during that  period. No matter how or when the payment is made, there is no interruption of  earnings during this period (EI  Regulation 14(4)). An example of this is a stevedore who is  guaranteed an income equivalent to forty weeks of work during the year.The same principle applies in the case of a claimant who has an  agreement with the employer to self-fund a period of leave. For example, the  claimant works and defers a portion of their salary for four years in order to  finance and be on leave for the fifth year. The claimant does not have an  interruption of earnings during the self-funded leave period (EI  Regulation 14(6), EI Act  11(3)), unless the agreement concerning the self-funded leave is broken,  for example, if the claimant permanently terminates this employment. The  claimant, in principle, cannot establish a benefit period during such a leave period,  regardless of the type of benefits that are claimed.A claimant could establish a benefit period because of an interruption  of earnings that occurred before or during the self-funded leave. In such a  case, entitlement to benefits will be determined by examining the employment  status of the claimant, the determination of earnings, or other elements of  entitlement.",57.15495555555559,12.188133333333337,13.02386679866686,15.431111111111116,13.72924888888889,9.688479999999998,51.37777777777778,6.555555555555555,3.356614943759752,0.9426701278118486,0.4647364175874842,0.0658206467189492,0.8671427741646767,0.8697414398193359,4.516,4.0,2.855476142432291,27.77777777777778,26.0,6.32065006814573,1.436,1.0,0.7835202613844775,250,105,0.42,1146,9,2.3.4,Payment for specific contract period,Chapter 2 - Interruption of earnings

104,104,"Any decision on an allocation or an interruption of earnings is based on  the contractual agreement between the employer and employee. The key  considerations would be the effective date and duration of the contract, as  well as the period for which the earnings in question are payable.As well, in the case of a contract of employment covering a period where  the performance of services is not always required or rendered, the Federal  Court of Appeal stated the following : (FCA  A-951-90, CUB  18718; FCA  A-769-90, CUB  18566). the allocation of earnings paid under such a contract must be made over the period for which the earnings were payable rather than to the time the employee performed the services or obligations. The fact that services were not performed during certain periods is irrelevant;the allocation of earnings must be so allocated even if the contract is concluded at a date later than the period for which it was payable. The allocation, then, covers a retroactive period that is earlier than the date the contract was concluded;the fact that the employer delayed in paying the earnings which were to have been regularly paid during the period for which it was payable cannot lead to a conclusion that the contract began only when the earnings were paid.Such situations could occur in the teaching field where employment  contracts may start or end on dates which do not coincide with the dates work is actually performed, or where services are not performed during the entire period covered by the contract or for which the earnings are paid. However, different  rules apply in the case of teachers, which are defined in the regulations as  those who teach in a pre-elementary, an elementary or a secondary school,  including a technical or vocational school (EI  Regulation 33).Leaving employment or being fired may terminate the contractual  obligations before a contract expires and result in an interruption of  earnings.",37.54826880530975,18.54922935103245,16.061879428645646,21.787758112094394,22.070951327433622,11.357758112094396,69.21865781710915,11.375,3.2353430418809577,0.6064329658671549,0.4866413351594095,0.0619010145415199,0.9035333139555796,0.8860706885655721,4.737463126843658,4.0,2.889118134270926,42.375,42.5,13.738063000292293,1.4926253687315634,1.0,0.8356573436131574,339,147,0.4336283185840708,1618,8,2.4.1,Terms of the contract,Chapter 2 - Interruption of earnings
105,105,"The prompt filing of a claim for benefits is a basic requirement for the administration of the Employment Insurance (EI) Act (the act). Subsection 10(1) of the act states that a benefit period begins on the later of:the Sunday of the week in which the interruption of earnings occurs, andthe Sunday of the week in which the initial claim for benefits is made.An interruption of earnings occurs where, following a period of employment, an insured person is laid off or separated from that employment and has a period of seven or more consecutive days with no work and no earnings, from that employment (EI Regulation 14(2)).The wording in the regulation means that, when an initial claim is filed in the week in which the interruption of earnings occurs, the benefit period will begin on the Sunday of that week; otherwise the benefit period will begin on the Sunday of the week in which the application is filed. For efficiency in the processing of EI claims, the Commission has an administrative policy in place, which provides an exception to this rule.  This policy will be described later in this chapter.When a claimant files an initial claim for benefits beyond the week of the interruption of earnings but wants to have the claim begin at an earlier date, they must make a request to antedate the claim to that earlier date. The act provides for the antedating of a benefit period to a date that is earlier than the actual date the claim was filed, when certain conditions are met.   A claim can only be antedated if the claimant shows that they qualified to receive benefits on the earlier day and that there was good cause for the entire period of the delay in filing, that is, from the day they wish their claim to start, to the day they made their initial claim (EIA 10(4)). These factors will be discussed in greater detail in the next section.The concept of antedating also applies to renewal or continuing claims, and to all benefit types (EIA 10(5)).",53.11694412607452,14.520713467048717,14.410869940926824,18.42991404011461,17.41068767908309,10.05616045845272,55.53037249283668,7.2,3.198147100431844,0.9296281707475784,0.4741429920134076,0.0556348108333004,0.8672975169287788,0.8567920252680779,4.541547277936963,4.0,2.5830878017605863,34.9,27.0,24.2835335155327,1.3982808022922637,1.0,0.7823976236504762,349,136,0.3896848137535816,1620,10,3.1.0,What is an antedate,Chapter 3 - Antedate
106,106,"Historically, the Commission received a large number of antedate requests involving short delays in applying for EI benefits, with the majority of those antedate requests being approved. Therefore, to offer better service to claimants and to remove the burden of requesting an antedate, the Commission introduced the Administrative Policy, also commonly referred to as the administrative rule.For the application to be considered submitted in a timely manner, the claimant must apply no later than 4 calendar weeks following:the week in which the interruption of earnings (I of E) occurs;the week in which the last day paid (LDP) falls;the last week for which wage loss insurance (WLI), workers' compensation benefits (WCB), or QuÃ©bec Parental Insurance Plan (QPIP) benefits are paid;for fishers: the week in which the trip ends (fresh catch) or the week in which the date of purchase (cured catch) occurs.Under the Administrative Policy, when a claimant submits an initial application within the 4-week period (i.e. in a timely manner), the benefit period (BP) is established in one of the following weeks, whichever is to the claimant's advantage:the week in which the I of E occurs;the last week worked;the last week for which WLI, WCB or QPIP benefits are paidThe Administrative Policy also applies to subsequent claims. A subsequent claim is considered submitted in a timely manner and can be established in the week immediately after the week in which the previous claim ended when a new application is submitted within either of the following periods:five weeks from the week in which the last claimant's report from the previous claim was sent;four weeks from the week in which the final claimant's report was processed.Even though renewal claims do not require an I of E, the Administrative Policy principles also apply to the renewal date of a claim. This means a claimant has 4 weeks following the week they stopped working to submit their renewal application without having to request an antedate.In all cases, for an initial claim, renewal claim, or subsequent claim, a claimant who applies after the 4-calendar-week timeframe must request an antedate if they would like their BP to start at an earlier date. For more information on antedates, refer to Digest Chapter 3.This policy applies only when it is to the claimant's advantage.",39.011758304696485,18.527972508591063,16.32212239822248,22.19289805269187,23.335658648339063,12.489072164948452,70.43069873997709,11.77777777777778,3.8196186838580983,1.198831788703258,0.4596590010514552,0.0331977118475492,0.8668303564190865,0.8537482959883553,4.927835051546392,4.0,2.8502031856687218,43.11111111111112,30.0,23.633518778983024,1.4664948453608246,1.0,0.8473190482699292,388,168,0.4329896907216495,1973,9,3.1.1,The administrative policy,Chapter 3 - Antedate

The claim can never be backdated beyond the legal interruption of earnings.The backdating policy can be applied when:after a claimant stopped working, they received WLI and/or WC in the week immediately preceding the week that would normally be the effective date of the claim; andthe claimant is required to serve the waiting period.Before applying the backdating policy, it must be determined if the waiting period can be waived.

108,108,"A claim is considered a renewal claim when a claimant requests benefits after they have stopped completing their claimant's reports for four or more consecutive weeks, for an existing benefit period (Digest 1.9.1).

In other words, the effective date of a renewal will be the Sunday of the week prior to the week of application, provided it is to the claimant's advantage to do so. Backdating applies to renewal claims only. This is applied automatically, therefore, the claimant does not have to request it or meet specific conditions to qualify.Applying the backdating provision to renewal claims sets the effective date of the renewal.

It is not necessary to account for every single day but it must be readily concluded that there was good cause without any break, for the whole period.

There may be several  reasons, provided each one amounts to good cause.There can be no part-way positions based on, for example, mitigating circumstances saying that the claimant had some justification for the delay, even if good cause was not present.

132,132,"Contradictory statements from an individual would raise serious doubts about the accuracy of the facts as reported by that individual. This is particularly true on points that appear to be in the personal interest of the claimant, but may not be completely accurate. This is why statements made before the consequences of those statements are known, are often more credible than subsequent statements (FCA A-515-00, CUB 47481; FCA A-557-96, CUB 30578; Digest 10.3.2). On the other hand, a subsequent statement may be intended to provide corrections that do not serve the author's best interest, thereby showing a concern for accuracy over personal interest. Such a statement may be accepted as fully credible, even if it contradicts an earlier one, or in the absence of documentary evidence supporting it.When confronted with contradictory information coming from the same or different sources, consideration must first be given to how and with whom this may be verified, or what type of proof can be requested to clarify the situation. If it appears the claimant may be able to provide evidence which would eliminate all doubt, this evidence must be requested; if it is not provided, the claimant will be disentitled from benefits for failing to provide the requested proof.If the above situation does not lend itself to this approach, or if the information still remains contradictory, then a decision as to whether the claimant is entitled to benefits will be made on the balance of probabilities. This means that each statement will be scrutinized in order to determine how much weight it should be given, then a determination will be made as to which facts are considered most credible.

135,135,"For most employees, any working week during which they work less than a full week and receive less than the full weekly compensation is a week of unemployment (EIA 11). A full working week consists of the number of hours normally worked by full-time employees in the same grade, class or shift at the premises where the claimant is employed (EIR 31(1)).In determining whether a person has worked a full working week, holidays observed at the premises where the person is employed are counted as working days, whether or not compensation is received for these. The same is true for the day immediately preceding or following the holiday, when it is considered part of the holiday (EIR 29(3)). On the other hand, if the week under consideration is proven to be a week of unemployment, holidays and days off within that week are regarded as non-working days, provided that they are not paid.Exceptionally, when the full working week of a class of workers is much shorter than that normally worked elsewhere by full-time employees doing similar work, this is considered to be a week of unemployment (EIR 31(2); Jurisprudence Index/week of unemployment/babysitting/).It must be remembered that the amount of wages received for a full working week is not a decisive factor. A person employed in a government project under which she received $25 per week for 30 to 37 hours of work was held to be not unemployed as she worked approximately the same number of hours as other employees (Jurisprudence Index/week of unemployment/government programs/; FCA A-1166-87, CUB 14399). The number of days worked is not a decisive factor either. This is because the test relates to the number of hours worked in the week.

139,139,"When a person has had an interruption of earnings (Digest 2.3.2) and a benefit period is established, the question that arises is whether the person is considered unemployed; that is, is the week(s) in which the claimant does not work, considered a week of unemployment.In some workplaces, employees will regularly work more hours, days or shifts than what other individuals who work full-time elsewhere, normally work in a week. This could include workers in isolated worksites such as mines or sites, ocean platform drilling rigs and vessels on the St. Lawrence or Great Lakes, or work in various processing plants. Other workplaces whose operations are continuous may also have similar uninterrupted work patterns. Quite often in these cases employees will have a work pattern where they work for 6, 7 or more continuous days, followed by the same number of days off.Another pattern of work that is common is one in which the employee, according to a schedule with their employer, works more hours in a week than is normally considered full-time employment, and accumulates a period of leave to compensate for the extra hours worked within an established calendar period. The days covering the period of leave are often referred to as lay days.Generally, employees who have these types of work patterns would not be considered unemployed during the period of lay days, for the purposes of the EI Act. Even if specific provisions under a verbal or written agreement of employment, or a collective agreement, provide the method pursuant to which the period of leave is determined, these agreements do not supersede the Act.        There are 2 basic methods for determining the period of leave: one is based on a credit system whereby credits are earned and accumulated based on the number of hours or days worked, while the other method is based on an established schedule of alternating periods of work and leave, during a period of employment.The EI Act stipulates that, where, in each week, an insured person works a greater number of hours, days, or shifts, than are normally worked in a week by a person employed in full-time employment, and is entitled to a period of leave, pursuant to an employment agreement, the claimant shall be deemed to have worked a full working week during each week that falls wholly or partly, in the period of leave (EIA 11(4); EIR 14(3)).There is no formal definition of full-time employment in the EI Act or regulations. What constitutes full-time employment is a factual determination that should be based on evidence. On a case-by-case basis, a review of local labour market information and terms of the Employment Standards Act in the claimant's province or territory of employment should be reviewed to assist with the determination of what constitutes the number of hours normally worked in a week by persons employed in full-time employment.When the claimant works more hours or days than normal and is entitled to a period of leave to compensate for the additional work, the claimant is considered not unemployed during any week which the period of compensatory leave falls. When making this determination, the first condition relates to the number of hours of work itself, and the second condition relates to whether there is an entitlement to a period of leave under a verbal or written agreement, or an employment contract.It cannot be presumed based on an individual's work pattern, that an agreement with the employer providing for a period of leave exists; the file must contain evidence that an agreement (verbal or written) providing for the entitlement of lay days or a period of leave, exists. A decision to consider that a person is not unemployed for the above reasons must be based, as any other decision, on tangible evidence.When there is no such agreement or the collective agreement or contract of employment does not refer to lay days or to a period of leave for working a greater number of hours, days or shifts than are normally worked, it will be concluded there is a termination of employment at the end of each period worked. Claimants in this situation would be treated in the same manner as any other claimant who works long hours, is paid accordingly, and are therefore, considered to be unemployed. Standard availability rules apply.With respect to the accumulated days of leave, what must be determined when an employer's activities cease or a lay-off or separation occurs is whether, according to the verbal or written contract of employment or collective agreement, the insured person has a right to use up the lay days or accumulated leave credits. If this is the case, then that person can only be considered unemployed after the expiration of the period of leave, the lay days or accumulated leave credits (Jurisprudence Index/interruption of earnings/compensatory leave/; FCA A-708-92, CUB 20866).However, if the collective agreement or the verbal or written employment contract stipulates that the claimant loses those lay days or accumulated leave credits when their employment terminates, or when the employer's activities cease, the claimant is considered unemployed from the time the employment stops.  This is because there is no longer an entitlement to a period of leave (FCA A-58-06, CUB 65103). In this case, the issue may be one of allocation of earnings if the claimant is paid for the accumulated lay days (EIR 36(9)).A claimant may have a regular pattern of alternating periods where they work a higher number of hours or days than normal, which is followed by a period of leave. In this situation, the week in which the lay days or period of leave falls, cannot be considered a week of unemployment when it falls within a period covered by the alternating work and off work schedule (FCA A-92-03, CUB 56090A; CUB 52217A; Jurisprudence Index/interruption of earnings/compensatory leave/). However, if in a week, the lay days or period of leave falls after the employer's activities stop, the claimant will be considered unemployed as of that week. In fact, it is considered that the established schedule of alternate periods of work and leave is interrupted for the duration of the period when the employer's activities are stopped, provided that, during that week, the individual had not used any lay days or accumulated leave days, prior to the stoppage of the employer's activities.When or if the employer's operations resume it may be difficult to determine whether or not the claimant remains unemployed now that the schedule of work has been reactivated. Whether the effective first day of work is at the beginning of the week or later in the week, if it is followed by a period of leave in that week, the claimant will be considered not unemployed for the entire week. Otherwise, the issue will be one of allocation of earnings (EIR 36(4)). As well, the claimant will be subject to all of the requirements for proving availability for work.In a scenario where there is a set pattern of work and the employee does not work more hours in a week, than would be considered normal (40 hours; 5 days, followed by a week off), the determination of whether the week off is considered a week of unemployment requires careful consideration.The issue of a claimant's availability for work must also be considered. The EI Act requires that claimants be capable of and available for suitable employment while in receipt of EI regular benefits. Entitlement to benefits does not rely solely on the fact that one is available for work but rather on their proving it. Claimants must prove that, for each day they request payment of regular benefits, they are available for and actively seeking employment and are not placing undue restrictions on their availability.These principles apply equally to claimants who work a pattern of alternating weeks of normal hours and weeks off. Those claimants must continue to be willing to seek and accept suitable work during their off weeks. They must also be able to provide a record of their job search efforts for any week for which benefits are claimed, when requested by the Commission, as with any other claimant.",48.31666888987699,15.336127167630057,14.591154219164943,18.732444049207057,18.822216911219805,11.465838150289011,60.34267081665926,8.820512820512821,3.366090644140713,1.007131560350333,0.4725837990934343,0.0653865477702373,0.8659843755395789,0.8677012533754915,4.778901734104046,4.0,2.8161825833821514,35.48717948717949,30.0,19.399804115944445,1.4479768786127167,1.0,0.8083087027880955,1384,353,0.2550578034682081,6783,39,4.3.5,Lay days or periods of leave,Chapter 4 - Week of unemployment

141,141,"Workers are not unemployed during any week in which they are on annual leave (vacation) and for which they receive their usual remuneration for a full working week (EIA 11(2)). When the actual payment is made, is not a determining factor (CUB 56514). It is immaterial whether the leave with pay is taken during the course of employment, at the time of a separation from work (CUB 74797) or sometime during a lay-off (CUB 67739).A company may decide to close down for several weeks a year so that all employees take their vacation at the same time. Workers with little seniority may have entitlement to vacation for only part of the shutdown period. In spreading out the vacation pay according to the usual weekly remuneration of the worker, from the beginning of the shutdown, any week during which the allocation is equal to what the worker is normally paid, is not a week of unemployment. A proportionate deduction from the weekly benefits payable shall be made in respect of a week for which the worker receives less than the usual remuneration (Digest 4.1.3).On the other hand, workers are frequently given their accrued vacation pay at the time of separation, without actually being on vacation leave. In this case, the contract of service does not continue and the weeks immediately following separation may be weeks of unemployment. The same is true when vacation pay is paid during a period of lay-off without the contract of service being revived to allow for a vacation leave. However, the vacation pay will most likely reduce the weekly benefits payable (EIR 35; EIR 36; Digest 4.1.3).",47.75216117216121,14.134505494505492,14.867677710551934,17.701098901098902,16.009963369963373,11.030329670329673,54.14285714285714,7.222222222222222,3.083076401279342,0.5628393775390477,0.4724030689156773,0.0727966737502048,0.857039175927639,0.8577917388507298,4.728937728937729,4.0,2.594684191008102,30.33333333333333,28.0,14.460674642322571,1.5164835164835164,1.0,0.90617706057531,273,130,0.4761904761904761,1326,9,4.4.1,Annual vacation period,Chapter 4 - Week of unemployment

Any week for which a worker is being compensated for additional hours or overtime worked, and not required to perform some or all of their duties, is not a week of unemployment (EIA 11(2)). A contention that the payment should be allocated to the period during which the services were performed and not to the period of leave is not accepted.It is possible that a contract of service provides for a regular workweek that is longer than normal and allows a period of time off to compensate for the additional hours (lay days). Every week off granted in this way is not considered a week of unemployment (EIR 29(4); FCA A-92-03, CUB 56090A; CUB 52217A). When the remuneration is actually paid under the terms of the contract, is not a determining factor.It has been held many times that workers in the navigation industry are subject to this rule when using up lay days that were accrued while at sea for a certain period of time.

Regardless of when payment is made, or how many hours/days they work, the entire 40 weeks of the contract would not be considered weeks of unemployment.Similarly, any week covered by a contract of service where remuneration is provided for the period of the contract, is not a week of unemployment, even if the person is exempted from performing services during some of those weeks (EIA 11(2); EIR 29(4)).

150,150,"For the purpose of the following discussion, employer is understood to be someone who operates a business with a view to profit, and is not related to the claimant.Where the services provided by the claimant are in the nature of those generally performed for remuneration, a strong presumption will arise that a contract of service exists between the claimant and the person for whom services are provided. This presumption is not overcome merely by statements from both parties that no remuneration in any form is being paid in return for the services (FCA A-427-99, CUB 44889; A-274-95; CUB 27230). It is unusual for a person to work a full working week for a profit-making business, without any remuneration of any type.The amount of remuneration is a matter entirely between the employer and the employee, which should not concern the Commission. The remuneration that should or should not be paid for services provided is governed by provincial or federal labour legislation. For EI benefit purposes, the claimant's decision to work a full working week for only a few dollars, for a commission to be paid several months later, or for non-monetary considerations such as room and board, is irrelevant (FCA A-477-00, CUB 45675; Jurisprudence Index/week of unemployment/benevolent work/). Even in cases where no remuneration is paid, one may be considered as working, if there is a relationship that may be likened to or regarded in the same way as a contract of service, between the person performing the work, and the person benefiting from it (FCA A-105-98, CUB 39928; FCA A-245-97; CUB 36921).As an exception to the above, in a case where the claimant offered services to an employer at no charge with a view to proving competence and obtaining employment, it was held that such efforts were more in the nature of a job search than employment itself (Jurisprudence Index/availability for work/various activities/volunteer work/).",40.12548780487808,17.848170731707317,16.373557378465907,21.64390243902439,21.61481707317073,11.623170731707312,68.4390243902439,11.25,3.624516819562552,0.8030198568422758,0.4478054592764959,0.0569105164047106,0.8695757985115051,0.8457537094751993,4.786585365853658,4.0,2.905556585575467,41.0,31.5,28.600699292150185,1.478658536585366,1.0,0.9137343134619924,328,159,0.4847560975609756,1622,8,4.5.1,For an employer,Chapter 4 - Week of unemployment
151,151,"In some cases, a claimant must undergo a training period without remuneration prior to starting a new employment. The crucial point in these cases is whether the training course precedes the engagement, or is a condition and part of the employment.Where full-time attendance in the course is required and the course is more or less similar to on-the-job training, the claimant is considered working a full working week and not unemployed (FCA A-531-01; CUB 51844). This is so regardless of the working terms, the amount of remuneration provided during the training phase, or the absence of any remuneration (Jurisprudence Index/week of unemployment/work without earnings/). On the other hand, if the claimant is not under a contract of service during the training period, the weeks comprised in this period will be weeks of unemployment. However, the next question to consider will be the claimant's availability for work while attending the course (Digest 10.12.0).It must be borne in mind that, in order to be eligible for EI benefits, trainees have the onus of proving both conditions in any situation. Evidence must be provided to show that they are unemployed and available for work in any week for which a claim is made, during the training period (Jurisprudence Index/availability for work/courses/no choice/).",51.46356164383565,13.853437703848662,13.484332010920856,16.71519895629485,17.268199608610566,12.03634703196347,59.5962165688193,8.857142857142858,3.4560593447905474,0.5811199933908692,0.4498460436806301,0.0338717553954775,0.8922785023848215,0.861731743812561,4.894977168949771,4.0,2.864189602157007,31.285714285714285,31.0,8.327480938165527,1.461187214611872,1.0,0.8397110052015664,219,110,0.502283105022831,1109,7,4.5.2,Training period,Chapter 4 - Week of unemployment

This is true even in cases where, due to bankruptcy, the employee is not paid for some or any of the services provided (Digest 1.9.9).The primary reason for unemployment benefits is to compensate insured persons for the loss of earnings resulting from unemployment. The test to qualify for benefits does not depend on an employer's ability or inability to pay wages owing to an employee (Jurisprudence Index/availability for work/applicability/bankruptcy/). The program was not designed to compensate for unpaid salary due to an employer's financial difficulties. Therefore, the program should not be used as a remedy to offset what may be regarded as gaps in relevant legislation.

153,153,"In the case of claimants who receive no remuneration for services provided to their parents or other family members, the question to examine is whether the services are performed out of a sense of duty, or whether they are the result of an employer-employee relationship under which some non-monetary advantages are given (FCA A-771-88; CUB 15420; CUB 45444; Digest 4.6.9). The absence of remuneration of any type whatsoever generally indicates that there is no contract of service, in which case the services given to a member of the family may not amount to employment (Jurisprudence Index/week of unemployment/friends or relatives/; FCA A-986-88; CUB 15699). The following questions may help to clarify the facts in a particular case:Do the claimant's parents/family member operate a business or a farm?Are the services that are provided by the claimant, connected with the operation of the business or the farm? If no business or farm is involved, has the claimant undertaken substantial work that could normally have been performed only by qualified people?Does the claimant receive any monetary or non-monetary gain, other than that received before rendering the services? Do the services performed and the gains received exceed those that are commonly shared among members of the same family? Was the claimant previously given room and board free of charge? Who did the work at that time?Are the services given in the nature of those generally provided to a business for remuneration? Are they carried out during the normal hours of work, in the evening, during weekends or in the claimant's leisure time? Would the parents have to hire someone to do the work should the claimant quit or otherwise decide not to continue?Does the claimant devote more time to this activity than to seeking employment elsewhere? Is the claimant kept busy during the hours that are most favourable for a job search? Could this activity be continued while accepting full-time employment elsewhere? If not, is the claimant willing to quit?The above questions are used to verify the accuracy of the information provided by the interested parties. If it is established that there is no remuneration of any type paid to the claimant, cash or otherwise, it will be concluded that the services are not performed under a contract of service and that the claimant is unemployed, regardless of the situation. The availability for work will be the only question that has to be examined.With slight modifications, these questions can be adapted to other similar circumstances, for example in reverse situations where the claimant is a parent who has undertaken some work on behalf of a daughter or son, or the claimant helps a friend engaged in substantial activities.Once it has been determined that the services performed are in the nature of employment, the next question to consider is whether the claimant works a full working week. To this end, reference should be made to the general rules applicable depending on whether the claimant's hours of work are controlled by the employer (Digest 4.5.1). If it is determined that the claimant does not work a full working week, an assessment of the non-monetary considerations will be made, which will result in the applicable deduction from the weekly EI benefits payable.In a case where the claimant, in return for a monetary consideration, looked after a neighbour's baby at home, along with her own children, it was held that this was not employment (Digest 4.1.3).It must be kept in mind that the claimant has the onus of proving that any week for which benefits are being claimed is a week of unemployment (Digest 4.2.0). In addition, the claimant's availability for work must be proven with respect to each working day of that week (Digest 10.2.0). Whether or not the activity being considered constitutes employment, where the actions of a claimant show more concern for the activity than for seeking employment, this is evidence that their availability may be in question (Digest 10.14.0). A claimant may be able to prove they are unemployed within the meaning of the Act, however they must also prove their availability for work (Jurisprudence Index/week of unemployment/work without earnings/).",51.16265734265738,14.050271950271952,14.22525824180931,17.492981092981093,17.69881895881896,12.203304843304842,61.11137011137011,9.318181818181818,3.0337155495811943,0.6712410725446648,0.48778262487669,0.0687209060169802,0.8843763584182376,0.876923269033432,4.92022792022792,4.0,2.798944846856522,31.90909090909091,31.0,14.687375812733288,1.4572649572649572,1.0,0.8131907090147102,702,264,0.376068376068376,3546,22,4.5.4,For a relative or friend,Chapter 4 - Week of unemployment
154,154,"When determining whether working for a spouse is considered employment, a distinction should be made between two scenarios: the first in which the spouse has entered into a contractual relationship with a third party, and the second in which the spouse operates a business (Digest 4.6.7.4; Digest 4.6.9).With respect to the first scenario, a claimant may have agreed to perform part of the work for which the spouse is responsible under a contract. A typical scenario would be helping one's spouse in cleaning buildings at night or doing janitorial/superintendent work where both spouses live. No matter what the arrangement and how many hours each spouse devotes to the fulfillment of the contract, it is considered that the only one employed is the individual bound under the contract. Consequently, all earnings arising out of the contract are considered to belong to the claimant's spouse, and the question to consider is the availability of the claimant. Of course, if the claimant's spouse who is responsible for fulfilling the contract has also made a claim for benefits, the general rules would apply based on whether the claimant's spouse controls their own working hours. The two spouses will be considered employed only if the contractual relationship applies to both of them (FCA A-464-90; CUB 17990).As an exception to the above, where it is clearly shown that, for some reason, the spouse is unable to perform all the tasks required under the contract, the claimant may be considered as employed and in receipt of part of the earnings arising out of the contract. For example, this may be by reason of a spouse's temporary incapacity, prolonged absence from home, physical limitations or because the tasks require the services of more than one person (FCA A-904-96; CUB 35351). In these cases, it is considered that any earnings from the contract that are paid to the claimant for their assistance, are expenses incurred by the spouse with the contract. These expenses are for the direct purpose of earning the income (EIR 35(10)), and such expenses will constitute earnings by the claimant, in return for the assistance given. When the time comes to determine whether the claimant works a full working week, the general rules as to whether a person controls their own working hours will be applied. For any week found to be a week of unemployment, the claimant's earnings in cash or in kind must be taken into account. Should the amount disclosed as being the claimant's wages appear unrealistic, the Commission will make an assessment, based on what would be reasonable under the circumstances (EIR 35(12)).As for the second scenario, consideration will be given to the nature of the duties and responsibilities carried out by each one in the operation of the business (Digest 4.6.7.4; Digest 4.6.9). A determination will then be made regarding the employment status, earnings, and availability for other work, for each claimant.",48.08874443738081,15.801074380165293,13.518907172268552,18.44602670057216,20.47263668150033,12.476942148760331,65.32994278448824,10.461538461538462,3.4908702249635795,0.4458805714555641,0.4757067093755888,0.035596790720202,0.8881992697715759,0.8942291248928417,4.944214876033058,4.0,2.79369634348714,37.23076923076923,30.0,17.205338376185843,1.4297520661157024,1.0,0.7985156299384889,484,202,0.4173553719008264,2465,13,4.5.5,For a spouse,Chapter 4 - Week of unemployment
155,155,"Benevolent (volunteer) work is generally understood to be work performed on behalf of a charitable organization without any expectation of monetary consideration. A person engaged in such volunteer work is in no way bound under a contract of service. The absence of such contract is a decisive factor as far as entitlement to unemployment benefits is concerned.Therefore, in the absence of a contract of service, a claimant who provides services as a benevolent gesture is considered not to be involved in employment. This is true even if, in some instances, the services may be provided on a full-time basis, or the claimant may receive certain benefits, such as room and board, by living on the premises (Jurisprudence Index/week of unemployment/benevolent work/). The real question to examine under the circumstances is the claimant's availability for other work (Digest 10.14.1).Providing work to a business or employer without remuneration does not necessarily mean an individual is performing benevolent work.  In some cases, if the work is being done in anticipation of benefiting from it at a later date, such as creating future employment for the worker, there is a strong presumption that the worker is not unemployed (FCA A-427-99; CUB 44889). In one case, a claimant who devoted considerable time to the two businesses that his wife operated from the basement of the family home was held to be not unemployed. He did not prove that he would not derive any economic benefit from this activity whereas, to be authentic, volunteered work implies such a non-interest (FCA A-771-88, CUB 15420; Digest 4.6.7.4; Digest 4.6.9).",43.15056588186704,14.66592317224288,15.616094167265928,18.34960760016522,16.76678645187939,12.238066914498138,60.00041305245767,9.0,3.48629661599907,0.8131205489499275,0.4629674945058218,0.0605051829516617,0.8809061124920845,0.8942199604851859,4.936802973977695,4.0,3.157528120392473,29.88888888888889,30.0,9.230919593583833,1.5762081784386617,1.0,0.9672859596135236,269,149,0.5539033457249071,1370,9,4.5.6,Benevolent work,Chapter 4 - Week of unemployment
156,156,"Employment Insurance is intended to insure individuals employed under a contract of service, by a person or business. As such, self-employed persons generally are not covered under the Employment Insurance program (EIA 7; EIR 2, 3, 4; EIR 5, 6; EIR 7,8; EIR 9). The legislation is designed to provide temporary benefits to those who are unemployed and actively seeking work. It cannot be used to subsidize persons who are self-employed or engaged in the operation of a business, unless under an authorized employment activity (EIA 59(c); EIR 50; Digest 4.6.12), or under the Employment Insurance Fishing Regulations. Self-employed persons may qualify for benefits if they have accumulated the required number of hours of insurable employment from other employment. A claimant may commence self-employment activities while on claim, but must continue to meet all other entitlement conditions to receive benefits.Once a self-employed person meets the qualifying conditions to establish a claim for benefits, in order to be entitled to receive benefits, they must demonstrate that they are unemployed for each week claimed. A person is unemployed if they do not work a full working week. Generally, a self-employed person is regarded as working a full working week, and therefore is not unemployed (EIR 30(1)). However, when the self-employment activity is so minor in extent that a person would not normally rely upon it as a principal means of livelihood, the claimant may be regarded as not working a full working week (EIR 30(2); 30(3); Digest 4.6.4). When this test is met, and all entitlement conditions for the type of benefits claimed are also met, they would be entitled to EI benefits as with any other claimant. Any earnings from the self-employment activities must be  considered and may reduce the amount of benefits payable (EIR 35; Digest 5.16.0).Part VII.1 of the EI Act provides for the payment of special benefits to self-employed persons.  Special benefits include sickness, maternity, parental, compassionate care and family caregiver benefits.  Qualifying and entitlement conditions for self-employed persons to receive these types of benefits are discussed in detail in Chapter 24 of this Digest.Because of the uniqueness of farming, special considerations apply when determining if a disentitlement applies for a full working week during the period that begins with the week in which October 1st falls, and ends with the week in which the following March 31st falls (EIR 30(4); Digest 4.6.5.1). However, farming is a business and must be examined using the same criteria as would apply to any other type of business (Digest 4.6.5).",47.18589439655173,13.43197557471264,14.643508229474929,16.852011494252874,15.518853448275864,12.267954022988503,59.37140804597701,8.75,3.446420952761778,0.9335395322273136,0.4420930748860973,0.0703895336932472,0.7922694027423859,0.8103578984737396,4.958620689655173,4.0,2.841100309926805,27.1875,24.0,10.607890636219814,1.560919540229885,1.0,0.8375328193039857,435,187,0.4298850574712644,2230,16,4.6.0,Independent workers working a full working week,Chapter 4 - Week of unemployment
157,157,"As previously discussed, there is a regulatory provision that addresses specific types of workers who are considered to be working a full working week, and are therefore not considered unemployed (EIR 30).

In the case of persons employed in any other employment in which they control their own working hours, they are unique in that they may be in an employer-employee relationship, however, they too determine if and when they work.All of these types of workers may be able to satisfy the primary condition of entitlement, namely the condition of being unemployed (EIA 9; EIA 11), if they can overcome the presumption of a full working week (EIR 30(2); Digest 4.6.4).",27.178571428571445,21.641428571428573,18.243605946275583,25.31428571428572,26.259540816326528,12.54591836734694,80.12244897959184,15.25,3.888319201554496,0.6195749196283661,0.4295619148560325,0.0335750624390078,0.8806259433428446,0.8734764754772186,4.923469387755102,4.0,3.0269638934629195,49.0,40.5,19.937402037376884,1.5357142857142858,1.0,0.9056230237932834,196,98,0.5,992,4,4.6.1,Types of self-employed workers,Chapter 4 - Week of unemployment
158,158,"To be entitled to benefits, the first basic condition is to be unemployed (EIA 9; EIA 11; CUB 72138; CUB 35691). The second essential condition is to prove capability and availability for work (EIA 18; EIA 50(8); Digest Chapter 10). The fact that a claimant is available for work is not decisive, as it does not necessarily mean that the claimant is not working a full working week. Consequently, claimants who claim to be available while working a full working week meet only one of the 2 required conditions. Even when such claimants prove they are prepared to accept a job and are making efforts in that direction, they do not prove they are unemployed.The factor to consider is the extent of the person's participation in a business, and not solely their availability to accept other employment. When it is decided that the claimant is not unemployed for a given period because they have worked a full working week, that decision cannot be overturned simply because the claimant had sought other employment during that period. The mere fact of having worked a full working week disentitles the claimant to benefits.",63.50625000000004,10.36375,11.93303328291395,13.558333333333332,12.746249999999996,10.651666666666664,48.47916666666666,5.875,3.287376989063429,0.5921815646853202,0.3981689715816174,0.0520767960273647,0.8032341854912894,0.7970378895600637,4.708333333333333,4.0,2.726859711992696,24.0,22.0,6.800735254367722,1.40625,1.0,0.7579869859260998,192,95,0.4947916666666667,930,8,4.6.2,Unemployment status and availability: Two distinct requirements,Chapter 4 - Week of unemployment
159,159,"The claimant's level of participation in a business will determine whether they are actually engaged in the operation of the business (EIR 30(1)), or only an investor in the business. A person may own a business as an investment but may not participate in its operation. It is essential to differentiate between engagement (Digest 4.6.3.1) and investment (Digest 4.6.3.2). When a person simply demonstrates a natural concern for an investment as an investor in the business, the person is not working in the business and therefore does not fall under the full working week provision (EIR 30(1)).In cases where some business activities are performed, assessment must be made as to whether the activities are those of a person operating a business or those of a person showing a natural concern for an investment. The key is the level of participation or involvement in the operation of the business. The time involved, as well as the nature of the activities performed are essential elements to consider in order to determine the extent of that claimant's engagement in the operation of the business. Once it has been determined that the claimant is engaged in the operation of a business, there are 6 factors included in the regulatory provision, that must be examined to determine the extent of that engagement (EIR 30(3); Digest 4.6.4.1).",42.33932126696837,15.197065287653526,15.719379583869454,18.782417582417583,17.607343244990304,12.289954751131225,65.05559146735617,10.571428571428571,3.205628964624584,0.905934646453236,0.4820222278764207,0.0558123290217753,0.7701984842618307,0.8094411373138428,4.936651583710408,4.0,3.003100300113658,31.571428571428573,30.0,19.7762999779111,1.5656108597285068,1.0,0.913197957292576,221,92,0.416289592760181,1120,7,4.6.3,Determination of engagement or investment,Chapter 4 - Week of unemployment
160,160,"Self-employment means being engaged in work or labour on one's own behalf, in a partnership, or as a co-adventurer, rather than being employed by someone else under a contract of service. It involves some work or labour by the claimant, in the business (Appendix A - Type of contract).Self-employment involves working and striving to achieve the results desired for a business. The efforts of the self-employed person are part of what makes the business run. Investment involves contributing money and capital, and as a result benefiting from the business operation through no work or effort on the investor's part, in achieving those results.Mere ownership of a business enterprise is not sufficient to warrant a finding that the claimant is self-employed. Something more than the status of shareholder or owner of a business, is required, since merely owning a business is not cause to be disentitled from benefits under the provisions of the legislation. The issue to consider is the level of participation of the claimant, in the running of the business. For self-employment to exist, there must be involvement in activities necessary to the operation of the business, such as those designed to generate business income, or involvement in the managing of people attempting to generate that income.",49.6211331775701,12.983621495327109,13.81666964889586,15.933644859813084,15.318925233644862,12.273644859813086,59.46028037383177,8.75,3.057417930835125,0.6828070737952314,0.4801155394328273,0.055078408287965,0.9031141059739248,0.887576957543691,4.962616822429907,4.0,2.968448519038909,26.75,29.0,7.838207703295441,1.5373831775700937,1.0,0.8065182309862979,214,108,0.5046728971962616,1094,8,4.6.3.1,Engagement in a business,Chapter 4 - Week of unemployment
161,161,"Investors usually hold an investment and derive income from the ownership of that investment or asset, not from their labour or work. People who are not engaged in self-employment, but have only invested in a business, expect profits through the efforts of the people who are running the business, such as, a business operator, promoter or a third party who is acting on the owner's behalf. Generally, those not engaged in self-employment benefit from the results of the business operation through ownership, and not through labour, work, or effort on their part. Without a personal engagement or involvement in the operation of a business, the business is simply an investment (Digest 5.3.1.6) and the full working week provisions do not apply (EIR 30(1)).A natural concern for an investment may include:activities that demonstrate care for the proper administration of the investment, that is, concern with whether or not the persons running the business are protecting the assets, or managing and reporting the results of the business accurately. It does not include supervision of the persons actually running the business, or involvement in the administration of the businessactivities that monitor the return on the moneys invested in a business, such as reviewing the financial statements to determine how much money is being made from the investment. It does not include directing the persons running the business in how to obtain a greater profitactivities that involve some actual participation in the business itself. However, that participation should be very negligible or extraordinary. Participation in the business should be unusual, occasional and exceptional and of little consequence compared to the overall operation of the business. A natural concern for an investment does not include activities that are performed on a regular basis even if these activities are only for an hour each week because those activities cannot be considered to be unusual, occasional, and for an exceptional purpose. For example, one is not considered to be engaged in the operation of a business if the individual participates in the yearly stockholder meetings to determine the future projections of the company or the direction that the company may take. These are activities of someone showing a natural concern for an investment rather than someone engaging in the operation of a businessA natural concern for an investment should not be confused with a person who is operating a business to a minor extent (EIR 30(2); Digest 4.6.4), for example, a person who performs their business activities only a few hours per week. The fact that the extent of the person's involvement is only a few hours per week cannot be used to establish that the business is an investment only, because they are performing the very work that the business requires. This person is engaged in the operation of the business and is not just showing a natural concern for an investment; however, that involvement may be minor in extent.When a claimant is not engaged in the operation of a business but is just showing a natural concern for an investment, there is no disentitlement for not being unemployed (EIA 9; EIA 11). Any income arising from that business is not earnings for benefit purposes (Digest 5.16.1).When the agent determines that the claimant is self-employed or engaged in the operation of a business, the next step is to determine if the claimant is working a full working week or if the claimant is only engaged in the business to a minor extent (EIR 30(1); 30(2)).",34.21885210466439,18.191733788395904,17.122413403193683,21.77001137656428,21.548845278725828,12.711877133105798,72.17246871444823,12.933333333333334,3.317888960961215,0.674335446727207,0.4400867330038884,0.0373489725567965,0.909933831010546,0.919841991021083,4.977815699658703,4.0,2.9796555920545678,39.06666666666667,40.0,17.245160351691588,1.5716723549488054,1.0,0.9045672518539104,586,197,0.3361774744027304,2984,15,4.6.3.2,A natural concern for an investment,Chapter 4 - Week of unemployment
162,162,"There is a clear and specific exception in the legislation, to overcome the presumption of a full working week. Self-employed workers, persons engaged in the operation of a business, and persons employed in any other employment in which they control their working hours, may be able to show that their work is performed to such a minor extent that a person would not normally rely on that employment or engagement as a principal means of livelihood (EIR 30(2)). If that is the case, there is no presumption that they work a full working week.To determine whether these claimants' employment-related activities are minor in extent, their employment is compared with others who normally rely on similar employment as their principal means of livelihood. The onus of proof is on claimants to demonstrate that their employment is to a lesser extent and that they devote less time and effort to it (EIA 50; Digest 4.2.0). When their employment-related activities are similar to those who follow the same occupation as a principal means of livelihood, they do not establish the requisite proof.This exception must be explored every time a claimant's not unemployed status is examined. To this end, the factors listed in the regulatory provision must be an integral part of the fact-finding and the decision-making process (EIR 30(3); Digest 4.6.4.1). An evaluation of these factors will assist in determining the extent to which the self-employment or employment in which the claimant controls their own hours, impacts their unemployed status (FCA A-418-97, CUB 35899).This exception also applies to claimants who are self-employed in farming or engaged in the operation of a farming business, other than during the period that begins with the week in which October 1st falls and ends with the week in which the following March 31st falls (EIR 30(4); Digest 4.6.5; Digest 4.6.5.1).",51.003519169329095,13.92115335463259,14.836745963215662,17.88741214057508,17.183130990415336,11.921661341853028,58.45654952076677,8.5,3.2964131007012734,0.7410216657114573,0.4254440818880743,0.0722636041788918,0.7937594784630669,0.7975928783416748,4.875399361022364,4.0,2.654877105318557,31.3,27.5,22.49911109355212,1.4664536741214058,1.0,0.770663718714415,313,144,0.4600638977635782,1573,10,4.6.4,Exception to overcome the presumption of a full working week,Chapter 4 - Week of unemployment
163,163,"The 6 factors to be considered in determining whether the claimant is employed or engaged in the operation of a business to such a minor extent they would not rely on that employment or engagement as a principal means of livelihood are the:time spentnature and amount of the capital and resources investedfinancial success or failure of the employment or businesscontinuity of the employment or businessnature of the employment or business, andclaimant's intention and willingness to seek and immediately accept alternate employmentThese 6 factors are stated in the text of EIR 30(3). This regulatory provision specifies that the extent of claimants' participation in self-employment, in the operation of a business, or in any other employment in which they control their working hours, should be judged in light of numerous factors rather than solely on the amount of time spent on that activity. Jurisprudence stressing consideration of all 6 circumstances should be used to support decisions under the present regulation (FCA A-418-97, CUB 35899; FCA A-58-94, CUB 23879; FCA A-614-94, CUB 25617).All of these factors must be considered in order to:obtain an overview of the situationassess the claimant's credibility with regard to the hours spent on the employment or businessdefine their role and responsibilities with regard to participation in that employment or engagement, anddetermine whether the relieving conditions set forth in EIR 30(2) have been metIf the claimant's employment-related activities are minor in extent, the claimant is considered not to have worked a full working week and therefore is unemployed. If the claimant's employment-related activities are more than minor in extent, the claimant is disentitled from benefits because they are working a full working week and therefore not unemployed.Financial statements can assist in fact finding as they may provide information on the extent of the claimant's involvement in the business. In practical terms:if a quick check of the income statement reveals no salaries, this may mean the claimant is operating the business on their own, without assistanceIf there are automobile, gasoline and travel expenses, this may indicate the claimant travels for the businesshigh rent, heat, and hydro expenses may indicate occupancy of a store or office, presupposing a considerable financial expenditure and the claimant's intention to work on their own accountFinancial statements can also provide information about the circumstances to be considered under EIR 30(3):the balance sheet can show the moneys invested: the equipment owned by the business and its value, owners' equity, and debt-load, as well as continuity of the business: assets and liabilitiesthe income statement can show financial success or failure in that it sets out profit or loss for a specific periodThe question of unemployment must be considered on an individual basis, since each person's situation is different, and must be examined in light of these differences. Each of the 6 factors must be taken into account. Examination of the 6 factors may reveal that some of them do not necessarily apply in all cases, since some are more relevant than others in different situations. Nonetheless, the result of the examination of the 6 factors must be fully documented in order to support the Commission's decision.",15.421287878787922,25.68280303030303,20.477631830292346,29.75454545454545,32.60407196969697,14.53204545454545,90.48484848484848,18.666666666666668,3.5652166143948745,1.016958638355725,0.4598129073514363,0.0218115740364005,0.9092041552066804,0.9146599769592284,5.244318181818182,4.0,3.277414375642699,58.66666666666666,30.0,48.973915959870354,1.558712121212121,1.0,0.9556252160179952,528,239,0.4526515151515151,2837,9,4.6.4.1,Factors determining whether a claimant's involvement is minor in extent,Chapter 4 - Week of unemployment
164,164,"The time spent is an important consideration, but it is not the only one applied to determine whether the claimant's activities are minor in extent. All types of efforts made by claimants to set up or continue their business or other employment in which they control their working hours, must be examined. The time of day or week that claimants devote to their business or other employment is also an important element to consider. Of course, the more time a person spends on activities, the greater the likelihood that they will be considered to be engaged to more than a minor extent.The fact that a claimant spends an amount of time on activities for approximately the same duration as a regular working week, may demonstrate that the activities are not minor in extent. This is particularly relevant if the person is obligated to keep a relatively strict schedule (EIR 30(2); CUB 37086; CUB 32849; FCA A-699-02; CUB 53297A). For example, the less time spent and the more flexible the hours, weekends or evenings, the greater possibility the activities are minor in extent. When the number of hours devoted to the activity is less than the number spent by someone following a similar activity as a principal means of livelihood, the conclusion that the claimant's engagement is more in the nature of a sideline may be supported.Normal labour market conditions with respect to the self-employment activity or other employment in which claimants control their working hours must be considered. Whether the claimant works at it during the day, in the evenings or at night is irrelevant if it is an activity which people normally carry out at any time, as a principal means of livelihood. The claimant's time spent must be compared against those following that type of employment as a principal means of livelihood (FCA A-113-97; CUB 36744).Slow periods or seasonal fluctuations do not automatically make the self-employment activity or other employment in which claimants control their working hours, minor in extent. A person's intentions during the period in question are often a good indicator of the claimant's unemployed status. The fact-finding should determine if the claimant is merely going through a slow period and if the activity is now a sideline, or if it is still a principal means of livelihood. Numerous businesses are seasonal in nature, so that the activities required of them cease during part of the year, or the tasks to be performed become substantially less. Claimants who pursue a seasonal activity may establish that they are working full working weeks during the on-season and are unemployed during the period in which the business ceases its activities (Digest  4.6.4.5).",52.90586135693218,13.365982300884957,14.265292616868656,17.097581120943953,16.561445427728614,11.83716814159292,57.5669616519174,8.266666666666667,3.2052361226586847,0.616506409242522,0.4768173609558508,0.0671746162389431,0.8546177915164402,0.8493507825411283,4.867256637168142,4.0,2.781908763379145,30.133333333333333,28.0,8.196476207628631,1.4579646017699115,1.0,0.7645365989515125,452,183,0.4048672566371681,2256,15,4.6.4.2,Time spent,Chapter 4 - Week of unemployment
165,165,"The larger the financial commitment to an enterprise, the more likely it is that the business is intended to be or become the claimant's principal means of livelihood. Claimants who put practically everything they have into the endeavour reflect their intention at that time to make it a permanent, viable business (CUB 34019; Jurisprudence Index/week of unemployment/business/).Indicators of whether or not claimants intend to make the endeavour a principal means of livelihood include but are not limited to:the capital and resources invested, material or equipment purchased, conversion of premises when the business is set up, or signing of a personal lease for the premises where the business is located (CUB 27866; CUB 24574)debt-load and line of credit, or moneys or salary from the business reinvested to ensure its continuityIt must be determined whether the moneys and securities involved are those which are normally invested to make such an endeavour profitable to the extent that it will become a person's principal means of livelihood, or alternatively whether they are normally expended for an occupation which is clearly secondary in nature.The person's contribution will not always be in the form of a monetary contribution. When persons enter into a business, the contribution of each of the participants may or may not constitute a capital outlay. Such contributions can be very different: real or personal property, credit or money, skill, experience, contracts, reputation or work.When the business experiences a major decline or finds itself in financial difficulties, claimants may indicate that they no longer intend to operate the business as a principal means of livelihood. The financial commitment and the efforts made to save the business can test the credibility of a claimant's statement regarding a change in intentions. For example, substantial amounts invested to revive the business may diminish the credibility of such a statement.",29.916061893203903,18.6821642394822,19.032712561301917,23.475889967637546,22.651917475728155,14.355987055016175,72.60558252427185,13.125,2.8792229544316026,0.9296185724563568,0.4595765208648826,0.0428408103360407,0.906805958066668,0.8849628369013468,5.258899676375404,4.0,3.192470929225216,38.625,22.5,44.297114748028456,1.627831715210356,1.0,0.9351126946071818,309,151,0.4886731391585761,1665,8,4.6.4.3,Nature and amount of the capital and resources invested,Chapter 4 - Week of unemployment
166,166,"The consequences to the claimant of the financial success or failure of the business or the other employment in which they control their working hours must be examined. The success of the business or the other employment is certainly a factor that strengthens the presumption that the claimant devoted the necessary time and effort to the endeavour. Conversely, failure to derive a return from the business or the other employment does not necessarily mean the claimant's activities are minor in extent. Nor can it be said that because profits are not satisfactory to the claimant, the business or the other employment is not the claimant's principal means of livelihood.The gross income derived from the business or other employment may constitute an important factor when a significant number of hours are being worked, and when it accurately reflects the size of the endeavour. It may serve to indicate whether or not the claimant's activities are minor in extent.Some claimants may reinvest all or most of their returns back into the business to strengthen it, instead of drawing a salary, then claim their involvement to be a simple investment because the business is not yet generating sufficient returns to pay their salary (Digest 4.6.3.2). The lack of financial success of a claimant's endeavours does not prove that they are engaged in self-employment activities to a minor extent. Low profit levels are very common for a new business.Financial return is not a decisive factor, and has no importance when claimants are engaged full time in setting up or ensuring the continuity of their business or their other employment. When claimants intend to make the business or the other employment their sole occupation or their principal means of livelihood, the amount of money derived from those activities is not an essential factor to consider in determining whether they are engaged in their employment to a minor extent (FCA A-699-02, CUB 53297).Fluctuating sales levels are also not sufficient to establish the right to benefits. If the conditions of the business change, leading to a sufficiently large drop in sales or to the possibility of the business being forced into bankruptcy, the claimant's intentions may change as well. Facing a bankruptcy may cause the claimant to either devote more time to the business, or to devote much less time to running the business and more to actively looking for other employment. Such facts might lead the claimant to request a reconsideration of their situation. The agent will take into account the claimant's new intentions in conjunction with the circumstances mentioned in EIR 30(3), to decide whether the claimant is still working a full working week while operating the business.",51.13104761904765,13.547285714285715,14.362553787682575,17.1252380952381,17.168980654761903,12.753303571428573,59.55416666666667,8.866666666666667,3.323658437849587,0.8223932032039283,0.4539245443976191,0.045712821186679,0.917104572057724,0.9140682862355158,5.024553571428571,4.0,2.888064226999282,29.866666666666667,29.0,13.0018802059121,1.4821428571428572,1.0,0.8015848459808372,448,184,0.4107142857142857,2296,15,4.6.4.4,Financial success or failure of the employment or business,Chapter 4 - Week of unemployment
167,167,"The continuity of the business or of other employment in which claimants control their own working hours, is relevant insofar as it demonstrates the intentions and the real nature of the claimants' participation in these employment-related activities. The fact that the business continues to operate during the period claimants are claiming benefits, is a relevant consideration because it may indicate that the business is serious enough to require more than mere minor interest on the part of the claimant.The business' level of activity is important to consider; has it increased, decreased, or remained constant?An increase could mean the business is no longer a sideline or secondary occupation but a principal means of livelihood. It could also mean the claimant is simply spending a few more hours in the self-employment activities but these hours still remain less than those spent by someone following it as a principal means of livelihoodA decrease could be because of a temporary decline in business, common at that particular time of year, because the claimant has hired someone to do their work, or due to the business activities having been permanently scaled back. Remaining constant could mean it has always been the claimant's principal means of livelihood, or may be a sign of minor in extent participation. For example, a claimant may have held a full-time job while running a business to which they devoted little time, and the time spent has not substantially changed following the termination of the full-time employment (FCA A-707-94, CUB 26138)Claimants may hold another job at the same time as they are self-employed or engaged in the operation of their business. That other job may constitute their principal means of livelihood. The issue is to decide whether their activity within the business, for the period they are claiming benefits, is carried out to such a minor extent that a person devoting the same time and effort would not normally rely on that activity as a principal means of livelihood.Continuity of the business can be used to substantiate that claimants are self-employed to a minor extent. This may occur when they have operated a business for many years while holding a full-time job elsewhere, and when the participation in the business is minimal and there has been no significant change in the participation following separation from full time employment (FCA A-707-94, CUB 26138). However, the continuity of the business may not be relevant when claimants use the period that they are unemployed from their full-time job, to spend significantly more time in self-employment activities.There are many endeavours of a seasonal nature where there is an established pattern of shutdown, such as where there is no activity for the business during the summer or winter period, according to the type of business. In such a situation, a person may be considered to work a full working week during the active season and be unemployed during the period in which the business ceases its activities. However, should the person undertake activities necessary to the operation of that business during the seasonal closure, such as, marketing the services of the company, a determination as to whether or not these activities are minor in extent must be made (FCA A-614-94, CUB 25617).",40.37134754990928,17.40574669432201,16.439396014739867,21.26009852216749,21.533580502981582,12.517096188747727,67.66930256676173,11.142857142857142,3.3701959970915403,0.7772581925140963,0.44700616333332,0.0413730254800103,0.9170435987986052,0.9305182347695032,4.943738656987295,4.0,2.840354742027209,39.35714285714285,38.0,16.29902338378917,1.4954627949183303,1.0,0.8367019528312817,551,206,0.3738656987295826,2785,14,4.6.4.5,Continuity of the employment or business,Chapter 4 - Week of unemployment
168,168,"The nature of the employment or business in which a claimant controls their working hours is used to determine if it is  the same as the claimant's usual line of employment. When it is, it is more likely that the claimant intends to make it their principal means of livelihood and devote a significant amount of time and effort to it (CUB 27886; CUB 21931). The occupation practiced may tend to confirm or refute the claimant's allegations that the business is a sideline, as opposed to a principal means of livelihood.The claimant's real intentions and time devoted must be considered. When the business or the other employment relates to or depends upon the claimant's skill or experience, then their participation becomes essential, and it is reasonable to assume that participation will be significant. Consideration must be given to the fact that claimants in this situation may become competitors of any employer who hires them, making it difficult for them to pursue their own trade anywhere but in their business. In this case, claimants may be making a principal means of livelihood out of the activity being set up, rather than relying on the remote possibility of securing work with a competitor.When the work performed falls outside the claimant's skill or experience, this may indicate that their participation is of only secondary importance unless of course, substantial time is devoted to the activity, or the claimant intends to make this work their principal means of livelihood.",47.78774193548388,14.295161290322582,15.247664890283003,18.206451612903223,17.278145161290325,12.218387096774194,59.22580645161291,8.75,2.944099416460632,0.650992894041333,0.4885224047756075,0.0608347809999457,0.9047503641673496,0.9005005160967509,4.92741935483871,4.0,2.9187198560901773,31.0,32.5,9.367496997597597,1.5080645161290325,1.0,0.9201680048382423,248,118,0.4758064516129032,1252,8,4.6.4.6,Nature of the employment or business,Chapter 4 - Week of unemployment
169,169,"The claimant's availability serves to enhance or diminish the weight to be given to their statements as to whether or not they are primarily engaged in the operation of a business or in any other employment in which they control their working hours.This factor makes it possible to verify a claimant's willingness to accept another job and the genuineness of their job search efforts (FCA A-104-00, CUB 44548A). The proof of availability required of such claimants is no different from that required of claimants in other circumstances (EIA 18; Digest Chapter 10). They must be prepared to immediately accept any suitable employment they are capable of performing, they must not set conditions, which unduly limit their employment opportunities, and, finally, they must behave in a manner which demonstrates their real desire to work. In the absence of a precise definition in the act, availability is verified by analysis of these 3 elements (FCA A-56-96, CUB 30987; CUB 72138).An intensive job search may be an indication that a claimant's involvement in operating a business or working in employment in which they control their working hours, is to such a minor extent, that a person would not rely on it as a principal means of livelihood. Conversely, the absence of efforts to find other work, or restrictions made on availability tend to suggest the opposite.Where the claimants' employment-related activities may appear to cause a restriction on availability, evidence that someone can take over if the claimant finds employment elsewhere, may support the claimant's statement that they can accept employment without any restrictions.On the other hand, claimants may restrict their availability because of their business or other employment in which they control their working hours, or may impose certain requirements with respect to acceptance of a job. For example, they may impose undue conditions on acceptance of a job because of work required in the business, by restricting their availability to a few days a week or by making no effort to find a job. When this happens, there is reason to believe that the activity is not minor in extent.Claimants engaged in their business or in other employment in which they control their working hours, to a minor extent, can receive benefits provided they look for work on their own behalf, rather than on behalf of the business. Seeking employment and seeking contracts to work on one's own account are different. Seeking contracts for the business is not a job search within the meaning of the act. Client follow-up, marketing for the business' products or services, or searching for new clients for the business are not regarded as active job search activities under the act. The same applies during the farming period defined in EIR 30(4) or during a seasonal closure.Claimants may take advantage of the fact that they are unemployed to devote more time to their business. However, this may affect their unemployed status and availability, particularly in terms of 3 factors: time spent, continuity of the employment or business, and claimant's intention and willingness to seek and immediately accept alternate employment (EIA 18; Digest Chapter 10).",48.99226890756304,14.09792717086835,14.12651844038596,17.152941176470588,17.50734789915966,12.574323809523808,60.977591036414566,9.294117647058824,3.2615705097013783,0.6824705538089627,0.4642653225561349,0.0415327840328181,0.838600654155016,0.8634702483812968,4.988571428571428,4.0,2.881775718635475,30.88235294117647,29.0,14.511181704591388,1.4952380952380953,1.0,0.784660187582704,525,214,0.4076190476190476,2694,17,4.6.4.7,Claimant's intention and willingness to seek and immediately accept alternate employment,Chapter 4 - Week of unemployment
170,170,"Farm operators are non-salaried individuals whose occupational activity consists of working or operating a farm. They may look after all operations, such as the production, distributing and marketing of farm products, with a view to realizing a profit from them. Activity may extend to maintenance of buildings, equipment and fences.Persons engaged in operating a farm are subject to the same regulatory provisions as those who operate any other business, whether as self-employed individuals, or as partners or co-adventurers (EIR 30(1); 30(2); 30(3)).To demonstrate they are unemployed and not considered to be working a full working week, claimants must prove that their farming activities are performed to such a minor extent, that a person would not normally rely on that employment as a principal means of livelihood (EIR 30(2)). The agent must therefore examine the 6 factors provided for by EIR 30(3), to determine whether the claimant works full working weeks, during any weeks EI benefits are claimed.Once it has been found that a person is engaged in farming as a principal means of livelihood, that person is regarded as working full working weeks and therefore not unemployed (EIR 30(1), (2), (3); FCA A-725-99, CUB 46122; Jurisprudence Index/week of unemployment/farming/). However, that person may still prove entitlement to benefits during the period that begins with the week in which October 1st falls, and ends with the week in which the following March 31st falls. To do so, they must prove that during that period, they did not work, or they were employed to such a minor extent, that it would not have prevented them from accepting full-time employment (EIR 30(4); Digest 4.6.5.1).A farm is an agricultural enterprise that combines capital and elementary production factors, such as plant and animal products and buildings, in a single economic and accounting unit, in order to draw from them a farm product destined for sale, with a view to realizing a profit.The Canada Revenue Agency defines farming as:tillage of the soil (in other words, plowing, sowing, and raising crops)raising or exhibiting livestockmaintaining horses for racingraising poultryfur farmingdairy farmingfruit growing, andbee keepingFarming includes other activities such as:engaging in an aquaculture operationoperating a woodlotplanting, growing, and harvesting Christmas treesoperating a nursery or greenhousegrowing tobacco or medicinal marijuana, but not the manufacturing or processing associated with these cropsoperating a chick hatcheryoperating a maple sugar bush, which may include extracting and collecting maple sap, orcultivating crops in water and hydroponicsIt is not compulsory that farming be the person's principal occupation in order to be eligible for a farm loan from Farm Credit Canada. Since 1992 that agency has been authorized to grant or guarantee loans to full-time or part-time farmers. Consequently, the fact that a claimant has obtained a farm loan does not in itself prove that they are operating an agricultural enterprise on a full-time basis. However, obtaining such a loan does become an indicator for exploring the role the claimant plays in the agricultural enterprise.",29.56870858184232,19.548354870775345,18.062587368997235,23.28754141815772,24.173899933730944,14.261550695825054,72.13535453943008,12.666666666666666,3.4257937762128923,0.806409473477397,0.4500732196249536,0.0652302947950978,0.8596059788357128,0.8560754239559174,5.232604373757456,4.0,3.21087407145226,41.91666666666666,28.5,30.877333470075136,1.5924453280318092,1.0,1.0336786902538584,503,245,0.4870775347912525,2715,12,4.6.5,Engaged in the operation of a farming business,Chapter 4 - Week of unemployment
171,171,"Persons engaged in farming are subject to the same regulatory provisions as persons engaged in the operation of any other business on their own account or in a partnership or co-adventure (EIR 30(1); 30(2); 30(3)). Once it has been found that a person is engaged in farming as a principal means of livelihood, that person is regarded as working full working weeks and therefore not unemployed (CUB 30067; Jurisprudence Index/week of unemployment/farming/).However, farming, because of the uniqueness of the business, has been given special considerations when determining the application of a disentitlement during the period that begins with the week in which October 1st falls, and ends with the week in which the following March 31st falls (EIR 30(4); CUB 68684) . This period is clearly defined in a regulatory provision and is not subject to any modification, regardless of the climatic conditions from one province to another.Unlike other types of business, a person engaged in farming as a principal means of livelihood may prove entitlement to benefits during the period that begins with the week in which October 1st falls and ends with the week in which the following March 31st falls. In order to prove entitlement for this period, the person must show that at any time during this period, they will not work in farming, or will be employed to such a minor extent that it would not prevent them from accepting full-time employment (EIR 30(4); FCA A-256-07, CUB 67904A). It is the entire period, taken as a whole that must be considered. The decision remains unchanged for the entire period, unless of course the claimant's situation changes, for example the farm is sold or expanded. However, it must be kept in mind that the provision defined in EIR 30(4) only needs to be considered if the person does not meet the relieving provisions of minor extent under EIR 30(2).The nature of the operation, seasonal activities for that type of operation, and the size of the farm are determining factors in deciding the extent of the work in farming during the period defined in EIR 30(4). The claimant's occupational history is an important indicator for determining whether the claimant is able, or has been able in the past, to accept full-time employment elsewhere during the defined period.If the facts on file show that the off-season related to the claimant's employment in farming does not coincide with the period provided for in EIR 30(4), that regulatory period cannot be modified or extended to meet the local farming conditions of individual farmers. In such a case, the claimant is subject to the same rules as any other person engaged in the operation of a business who claims EI benefits outside the period set out in the regulation (EIR 30(1), 30(2), 30(3)).",37.46244354371744,18.67129897703146,16.24694786949722,22.052962748504157,22.42909090909091,11.53545647558386,68.08357459949816,10.818181818181818,4.146189073859353,1.099675991819769,0.4396013192839819,0.058160051225461,0.8934359073638916,0.8828765352567037,4.766454352441613,4.0,2.69240891625556,42.81818181818182,39.0,20.51083164759618,1.4883227176220806,1.0,0.8492356685244093,471,186,0.3949044585987261,2317,11,4.6.5.1,Period defined in regulation 30(4) - Farming,Chapter 4 - Week of unemployment
172,172,"The period prior to the opening of a business is the beginning of the period where a person's unemployment status may be at issue. When the claimant is actively involved in the preliminary stages of opening a business, that is, while the business is not yet completely set up, the agent will review this period from the perspective of unemployment status. During this stage, the claimant is considered as already in business, similar to someone engaged in a newly opened business.However, the claimant may demonstrate that the work they perform during the preparatory period of the business, is so minor in extent that a person would not normally rely on that activity as a principal means of livelihood (EIR 30(2); FCA A-616-95, CUB 28870; Digest 4.6.4). If that is the case, the claimant is able to overcome the presumption that they work a full working week. The 6 factors also apply to the preparatory period (EIR 30(3); Digest 4.6.4.1).A disentitlement for being not unemployed cannot be imposed for only part of a week because it is based on the finding that the claimant is considered to be working a full working week. As such, the decision of not unemployed is based on full weeks only (EIA 9, EIR 30(1)). The decision is whether each of the weeks under review constitutes a week of unemployment. However, if it is determined that the claimant is unemployed for only part of a week, they may be found to be not available for the part of the week  they started self-employment activities, and receive benefits for the days they are not considered self-employed (EIA 18; Digest Chapter 10).

176,176,"A partnership is an organization that brings together 2 or more people for the purpose of carrying on a business in common, with a view to profit. There are 2 principal forms of partnership: a general partnership and a limited partnership. Both are based on a contract between 2 or more persons who pool their property, money and/or skills to operate an unincorporated business and to distribute profit from it to each partner. A partnership agreement may be written or verbal. A written contract normally sets out the responsibilities, the capital contributions and the time and energy that each partner will devote to the firm's business, as well as the respective shares of profits and losses that each partner will take.Theoretically, each partner participates in the administration of the partnership, signs contracts, and makes commitments on its behalf. However, the control and responsibility held by each partner varies depending whether the partnership is general or limited.In a general partnership, every partner may take part in the management of the partnership business. All partners are administrators, unless otherwise designated, and are jointly liable for the partnership's obligations, and personally liable for its debts. This form of business is preferred by persons engaged in a professional activity (accountants, lawyers, doctors, architects, engineers, etc.) and by certain commercial concerns.Claimants may establish a limited partnership. This is a form of commercial enterprise composed of 2 kinds of partners: general partners and limited partners.The important factor to remember is that general partners are those who set up, manage, administer and work in the business, while limited partners are those who contribute capital or property in the business, but are prohibited from taking an active role in its administration.When considering the unemployment status of a partner it is important to establish the exact nature of the claimant's status in the partnership, that is, whether the claimant is a general or a limited partner. By definition, a limited partner cannot be involved in the administration of the business, however if the claimant is a general partner, the nature and extent of their participation in the business activities must be determined (CUB 47156).",43.43835826408127,13.179379501385046,15.112257680678326,16.939686057248384,15.366712834718378,13.884875346260385,60.35475530932594,8.733333333333333,3.2950278098057,0.9432582144944855,0.4428790758111244,0.073031963496559,0.8236970603466034,0.8309520941514236,5.257617728531856,4.0,3.2474330588323226,24.066666666666663,21.0,11.480224542906624,1.6426592797783934,1.0,0.985916122883308,361,160,0.4432132963988919,1952,15,4.6.7.3,Partnership: general or limited,Chapter 4 - Week of unemployment
177,177,"Claimants are engaged as a co-adventurer in a business when, regardless of the legal form of the business, they have an interest in it with others and they involve themselves personally in the activities deemed necessary for its operation (CUB 50122). It makes no difference whether the business is registered or incorporated (FCA A-136-96, CUB 31814; FCA A-348-96, CUB 33274).As long as the claimant has an interest in the business and is engaged in its operation, the question of who actually owns the business is not a decisive factor for determining whether the claimant is acting as a co-adventurer.Co-adventurers include individuals who contribute, without pay, to various tasks in a corporation in which others may be the sole shareholders, even though the individuals have no legal relationship with it.A claimant's interest in a business can take many forms, from money given or invested to assist the owner of the business, to the expectation of gaining from the profits or success of the business.To determine if the claimant is a co-adventurer in the business, the agent must examine the real extent of the claimant's interest in the business, and the activity in which they are engaged (Digest 4.6.3). In the framework of this activity, the agent must ensure that the claimant controls their own hours of work and is not bound by a contract of service, or arrangements similar to a contract of service (EIR 29; EIR 31; FCA A-771-88, CUB 15420). The agent must have an overview of the business: the owners, the shareholders, and the claimant's relationship with the owners, details about the job performed and, finally, the claimant's employment history.The agent must bring out the elements that demonstrate the claimant's interest in the affairs of the company, as those elements distinguish between co-adventurer, and volunteering assistance to a business enterprise (Digest 4.6.9). In some cases, claimants may assert that they are merely giving the company a hand, but analysis of the facts in the file may demonstrate that the opposite is true. Claimants alleging volunteer work must prove that the assistance is provided free of charge, in a disinterested manner, and without obligation (CUB 70769).When a claimant has been found to be acting as a person engaged in a co-adventure, the 6 factors provided for by EIR 30(3) must be considered to determine if the claimant worked a full working week (EIR 30(2); Digest 4.6.4.1).",44.0975609756098,17.294146341463414,14.975302809339372,20.59512195121951,21.73543902439025,11.773756097560977,70.51219512195122,12.1,4.319910885374158,1.1027243402848237,0.4543647887845278,0.0327584121565072,0.9131015009350248,0.9184708818793296,4.81219512195122,4.0,2.8629419562495944,41.0,35.5,11.653325705565772,1.431707317073171,1.0,0.7692058065779859,410,181,0.4414634146341463,2048,10,4.6.7.4,Co-adventurer,Chapter 4 - Week of unemployment
178,178,"A business corporation is a type of enterprise usually referred to as a limited company or corporation. Ownership is divided into shares. Its legal name ends with Limited (Ltd.), Incorporated (Inc.) or Company (Co.). Throughout this chapter, rather than using the full term corporation or limited company, corporation alone will be used.A corporation is an artificial being, invisible, intangible and existing only in the eyes of the law. This definition has led legal experts to affirm that a corporation is a legal entity, separate and distinct from those who own it, the shareholders. This characteristic confers upon the corporation, all the rights and responsibilities of a person. One of the significant differences between a sole proprietorship, a partnership and a corporation is that a corporation has a separate legal existence in law and it can own property, make contracts and be responsible for debts, just like any individual. One of the advantages of a corporate structure business organization is that the shareholders are able to invest and receive a regular return, without having to take any additional risk beyond the sum invested, or take an active part in management of the corporation's business affairs.Although shareholders are the true owners of the corporation in which they hold shares, a corporation is managed by a board of directors, which sees to its proper operation, appoints the employees it deems necessary, and determines their functions and remuneration. The board is elected by the shareholders who, in that respect, have some control over who will manage the corporation. However, the board itself is responsible for managing the corporation.Some corporations have a few shareholders, or, even only one. In these types of situations, there may be no real distinction between the owners and managers, and between the shareholders and the board of directors. The shareholders would likely be the people who manage the corporation. However, it is possible that not all shareholders participate in the running of the corporation.When considering the unemployment status of a shareholder it is important to determine the exact nature of the claimant's status in the corporation (FCA A-418-97, CUB 35899; Digest 4.6.8.1).",45.70487394957985,12.10140056022409,14.470270418902462,15.90700280112045,13.437983193277311,13.211652661064427,51.53221288515407,6.411764705882353,2.736114301246692,0.6914767688301959,0.4578412821014747,0.0408099877436614,0.7987905582413077,0.8027794837951661,5.173669467787115,4.0,3.258787943382652,21.0,17.0,11.742331665439211,1.6526610644257702,1.0,1.032971797224964,357,181,0.5070028011204482,1904,17,4.6.7.5,Corporation or limited company,Chapter 4 - Week of unemployment
179,179,"The expression piercing the corporate veil means to ignore the separate existence of a corporation and look beyond the corporate veil, which shields the individuals controlling the corporation. This allows the Commission to consider the reality of the claimant's situation (CUB 47156; FCA A-698-95, CUB 29518; Jurisprudence Index/week of unemployment/working for own company/; Jurisprudence Index/week of unemployment/shareholders/; Jurisprudence Index/week of unemployment/co-adventure/). It is necessary to pierce the corporate veil in cases where claimants participate in the operation of the corporation other than as a paid employee.Piercing the corporate veil enables the Commission to:determine the claimant's true relationship with the corporationeliminate the technicalities of corporate law that give a company a separate legal personality from that of its shareholders, andconsider any earnings from the self-employment activities of a claimant who is engaged in the operation of the corporation (Digest 5.16.2.3)Some people allege that the business' activities in which they are engaged are on behalf of the corporation, not on their own account, and that they are therefore not self-employed. However, the legal status of the operation or business in which the self-employed person works is irrelevant (FCA A-136-96, CUB 31814; FCA A-348-96, CUB 33274). It is the claimant's activities in the operation of the corporation that are relevant. This is true no matter what percentage of shares a person may own.The fact that the employment of a corporate shareholder was ruled insurable does not mean the claimant is not self-employed when they are engaged in the operation of the corporation. It is not the intention of the legislation to consider that a person who works on their own behalf, or as co-adventurer, is not self-employed  simply because they formed a corporation within which they worked in insurable employment (EIA 5(2)(b); FCA A-247-96, CUB 32697; CUB 68677; Digest 4.6.8.1).When fact-finding shows that the person is essentially engaged in the operation of a corporation, or is its directing authority, it is reasonable to conclude that the individual is engaged in the operation of that business (CUB 75971; Jurisprudence Index/week of unemployment/shareholders/). It is not equitable to pay EI benefits to one claimant and not another, when the only difference between the 2 is that one business is incorporated, and the other is not (CUB 62304B; CUB 31527; Jurisprudence Index/week of unemployment/working for own company/; Jurisprudence Index/week of unemployment/shareholders/).",25.622521791767557,19.94557142857143,19.1858809040293,24.17133171912833,23.70515738498789,14.050750605326876,71.32421307506053,12.4,3.862071614486541,1.221108350641228,0.4856155523998083,0.050655580061408,0.8264283537864685,0.8293040916323662,5.198547215496368,4.0,3.294914684852757,41.3,29.5,27.1221311846986,1.6464891041162228,1.0,1.044282727296679,413,160,0.387409200968523,2226,10,4.6.8,Piercing the corporate veil,Chapter 4 - Week of unemployment
180,180,"Claimants may hold shares in a corporation where they work as employees; they may also participate in its operation. The agent must identify the claimant's role in the corporation. The fact of being a shareholder in a corporation does not mean that the person is participating in the running of the business (Digest 4.6.7.5). When considering a matter relating to the unemployed status of claimants who are shareholders in a corporation, it is particularly important to establish the position they hold in the corporate structure and its related responsibilities, in order to determine whether they have a role in the operation of the business. The claimant could be acting as an investor (Digest 4.6.3.2), as an employee subject to a work schedule (EIR 29; EIR 31), as a person engaged in operating that corporation as a business on their own account or in a co-adventure (Digest 4.6.7.4), or a combination of these positions.Some claimants may be both a paid employee of the corporation and perform functions for which salary or wages are not paid.When the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) rules that the claimant's employment is insurable, it can be concluded that, for the working hours ruled insurable, the claimant acted as an employee subject to the work schedule of the corporation, and therefore may be eligible to receive EI benefits. However, the fact that CRA ruled the claimant's employment insurable does not mean the claimant will receive EI benefits. They must first demonstrate that they are unemployed, in relation to the corporation (FCA A-247-96, CUB 32697; FCA A-999-96, CUB 35986). Though the employment may be ruled insurable, the claimant could still be considered not unemployed if they are also participating in running the business.When the claimant continues to participate in the operation of the corporation, they will be considered to have worked a full working week unless the minor in extent exception is proven (EIR 30(2), 30(3)). The fact that the claimant worked in insurable employment is not relevant, nor is it a determining factor regarding the claimant's unemployed status in the period for which benefits are claimed. As well, the fact that the self-employment under review is the same employment used by the claimant to qualify to establish a claim for benefits, is irrelevant (FCA A-247-96, CUB 32697; FCA A-999-96, CUB 35986). It is the total number of hours a claimant spends in pursuing the business that must be considered, including the hours worked as an employee as well as those worked in the operation of the corporation. Consequently, when the claimant continues to participate in the operation of the corporation, the decision is made under the not unemployed provisions for self-employed workers, taking into account the number of hours worked as an employee, as well as those hours worked in the operation of the corporation (EIR 30).There are certain documents that can assist in determining whether the person is involved in the running of the enterprise. The corporation maintains its articles, regulations, charter, list of directors, minutes of meetings, and is required to produce and archive an annual report that contains a significant amount of useful information about its activities.When a shareholder-employee of a corporation can lay themselves off, it raises the question of voluntary lay-off (EIA 30). That issue must be resolved, giving full consideration to any circumstances that may prove just cause (Digest Chapter 6).",43.68719891219894,15.060326340326345,16.18397175987059,19.284537684537685,17.819500777000776,12.4320979020979,61.148407148407145,9.333333333333334,3.30664410553458,0.6902466296833124,0.448679666875164,0.057391828405531,0.851477349505705,0.8769549950957298,4.95979020979021,4.0,2.970741700265165,31.77777777777778,28.0,14.497339049155634,1.5472027972027973,1.0,0.95137508548358,572,216,0.3776223776223776,2932,18,4.6.8.1,Claimants who are corporate shareholders,Chapter 4 - Week of unemployment
181,181,"Claimants may lend a hand in a business owned by someone they know. Lending a hand in a business means different things to different people. The agent must consider all the facts surrounding such assistance and establish the real situation between the parties to verify whether some type of compensation is received in return for that assistance. This consideration is necessary to determine if the claimant is truly a volunteer, or acting as an employee or as a co-adventurer in the business (Digest 4.6.7.4).Claimants are truly volunteers when:they receive no pay for their workthey neither derive nor hope to derive any benefit, profit, financial or economic advantage from the workthe assistance is provided in a disinterested way without obligation, andthey are not bound by a contract of service, or arrangements similar to a contract of service (FCA A-962-88, CUB 15702)When a claimant receives or expects to receive something in return for their assistance, it can no longer be said that it is volunteer work (CUB 70769; FCA A-105-98, CUB 39928; Digest 5.16.2.2). In fact, claimants do not truly volunteer when they offer their services with the expectation of receiving, in the short or medium term:monetary or material benefit (CUB 32650)a promise of an eventual position (FCA A-1009-90, CUB 18752)accommodation and meals (CUB 21373)company shares (CUB 25125), orany gain due to the success of their relative's company (CUB 26139; FCA A-986-88, CUB 15699)It is up to claimants to prove that they receive no economic advantage from their assistance (FCA A-771-88, CUB 15420).When a claimant provides assistance to another, it is not considered employment if it is determined that the claimant is not acting as a co-adventurer, as there is no contract of service (EIA 11; Digest 4.6.7.4). The assistance is provided in a disinterested way without obligation, and the claimant will not receive any benefit from it (FCA A-986-88, CUB 15699). In such a situation, it cannot be said that the claimant is engaged in the operation of a business, or that they are working under a contract of service because of the assistance given, even if the assistance is provided on a regular basis (CUB 50107; FCA A-341-79, CUB 5560). Therefore, the claimant will have proven that they are unemployed. This applies regardless of what the relationship is between the individuals (i.e. friend, relative or spouse).When it is determined that the person is truly a volunteer, and therefore unemployed, the agent must then rule on the question of availability. Volunteering assumes that the person provides assistance solely to fill up free time, while remaining available and looking for work (Digest Chapter 10.14.1). It is not the fact that the claimant is lending a hand that makes them not available, rather it is the absence of efforts to find work, or restrictions made on their availability because of the time spent assisting in the business.",37.70156565656566,18.97671156004489,17.33285097705468,23.269435091657314,23.77479797979797,12.385596707818928,74.84025439580995,13.545454545454543,3.416698450105529,0.9683073286911044,0.4536919408669245,0.0736890849278507,0.8934026420116424,0.8931086858113607,4.907407407407407,4.0,2.997541287837552,44.18181818181818,32.0,37.45255952369654,1.469135802469136,1.0,0.8376886643796235,486,212,0.4362139917695473,2463,11,4.6.9,Volunteering assistance to a business enterprise,Chapter 4 - Week of unemployment
182,182,"Persons who are self-employed, who operate a business on their own account or as partners or co-adventurers, or who have any other employment in which they control their own working hours are generally considered to have worked a full working week and therefore are not considered unemployed (EIR 30(1)).Despite this, such persons may qualify for sickness (EIA 18(1)(b), EIA 21; Digest Chapter 11), maternity (EIA 22; Digest Chapter 12), parental (EIA 23; Digest Chapter 13), compassionate care (EIA 23.1; Digest Chapter 23) and/or family caregiver benefits (EIA 23.2, EIA 23.3; Digest Chapter 22). They must still have accumulated sufficient insurable hours to establish a benefit period and meet the entitlement conditions applicable to the specific type of benefits being requested (EIA 7; Digest 1.2.0). However, payment of such benefits is considered only in respect of a week of unemployment: in other words, only for those weeks during which the claimant did not work a full working week (EIA 11).Claimants demonstrate that they are unemployed and not working a full working week when they prove that their employment-related activities in their business are performed to such a minor extent, that a person would not normally rely on that employment as a principal means of livelihood (EIR 30(2); Digest 4.6.4). The agent must examine the 6 factors provided for by EIR 30(3) to determine whether or not the claimant works a full working week for the period in respect of which special benefits are being claimed (CUB 25211; Digest 4.6.4.1).When a claimant engaged in the operation of a business also works as an employee in insurable employment, it is particularly important to establish the position and the related responsibilities the claimant holds in the corporate structure, in order to determine whether the claimant has a role in the operation of the business (Digest 4.6.8). Even when the employment is ruled insurable, the claimant may still be considered not unemployed if, in addition to working as an employee, they are participating in the running of the business.When the claimant continues to participate in the operation of the corporation, for the period in respect of which special benefits are being claimed, they will be considered to be working full working weeks unless the minor in extent exception is proven (EIR 30(2), 30(3)). When claimants do not meet the minor in extent exception, no sickness, maternity, parental, compassionate care or family caregiver benefits are payable in respect of such weeks.Earnings from self-employment are only allocated when the claimant's involvement or engagement in the self-employment is determined to be minor in extent (EIR 35; Digest 5.16.0).  If it is not, a disentitlement for full working weeks is imposed, rather than allocating earnings. When persons claiming and satisfying the conditions to receive maternity, parental, compassionate care and/or family caregiver benefits meet the minor in extent exception, such benefits are payable for each week of unemployment within the period of leave.There is an additional provision that applies to persons claiming sickness benefits. These claimants must also prove that, had it not been for their incapacity, they would have been otherwise available for work (EIA 18). This second condition provided for by the act is aimed at limiting the payment of sickness benefits solely to persons who would have been eligible for regular benefits, had it not been for their incapacity for work (Digest 11.3.0). Sickness benefits are payable for each week of unemployment in the period when claimants meet both the first entitlement condition, that they are unemployed, and the second condition, that they would have been otherwise available for work.  Claimants in receipt of parental, compassionate care or family caregiver benefits are exempt from proving they would have been otherwise available for work.",33.52135356762514,18.951495207667737,17.879347455551382,23.08310969116081,23.56601171458999,13.613993610223638,73.68221512247071,13.333333333333334,3.641438761819261,1.34524182975343,0.4735354458335248,0.0631375463060881,0.8774766198226384,0.8921511310797471,5.123003194888179,4.0,2.859189755978548,41.73333333333333,32.0,26.24618490794847,1.547923322683706,1.0,0.8802612706825855,626,214,0.3418530351437699,3304,15,4.6.10,Claim for special benefits,Chapter 4 - Week of unemployment

184,184,"The Commission may establish employment benefits to enable insured participants to obtain employment, including benefits to help them start a business or become self-employed (EIA 58; EIA 59(c); EIR 50). In this context, when a person is approved to take part in the employment benefit program called Self-Employment, that person is regarded as unemployed, capable of and available for work, for the duration of the program (EIA 25).Persons who are not accepted under this employment activity and who decide to start a business without being approved by an authority delegated by the Commission, are required to prove that they meet all the entitlement conditions for the type of benefits claimed, as is required for any other claimant. A decision by an authorized official about the referral of a claimant to this program is not subject to appeal (EIA 25(2)).While efforts made by claimants to create employment by starting their own business are commendable, without approval from a designated authority, this activity places them outside the purview of the EI scheme. The act is designed to provide temporary benefits to those who are unemployed and actively seeking other work. It cannot be used to subsidize entrepreneurs who are starting their own business, unless under an approved employment activity (FCA A-366-94, CUB 24632; FCA A-383-86, CUB 12132).",31.42954545454549,19.80636363636364,18.243605946275583,23.963636363636365,24.441136363636367,13.328181818181818,78.0909090909091,15.0,3.623740556784507,0.9888057289201224,0.4501384309306176,0.0683727587495548,0.8832909315824509,0.8673566182454427,5.068181818181818,4.0,2.8524130715200617,44.0,31.0,24.73054791143941,1.5454545454545454,1.0,0.7761954256776931,220,121,0.55,1146,5,4.6.12,Employment benefits for self-employment,Chapter 4 - Week of unemployment

186,186,"Many independent workers are primarily interested in pursuing their trade rather than operating a business. To do this, they contract themselves out to other persons and, normally, fulfill their contractual obligation without the help of anyone else, although they may at times hire the services of helpers. This is common in the construction industry.The general rule is that these independent workers are considered as working full working weeks and, therefore, are not entitled to be paid any benefits as long as they are engaged in fulfilling a contract. On the other hand, when they have no contract, they are considered unemployed (CUB 76074; Jurisprudence Index/week of unemployment/independent workers/). The same does not necessarily apply in the case of persons who seem more interested in operating a business as a contractor, rather than the mere pursuit of work in their trade (Digest  4.6.0).In order for tradespeople to prove that they are available for work, it is not enough to show that they are looking for new contracts as independent workers.

189,189,"The legislation contains regulatory provisions related to the interruption of earnings and which make it clear that EI benefits are not intended for real estate salespersons with a license, except for periods of unemployment due to incapacity, maternity, parental or providing care for a family member (EIR 14(5); Jurisprudence Index/interruption of earnings/real estate salespersons/). This is true no matter how many hours a week an individual devotes to this activity, as the regulation does not refer to the number of hours a real estate agent works, as a factor when considering whether they have an interruption of earnings. In spite of the above considerations, the fact remains that the provisions regarding an interruption of earnings have little to do with whether or not a week is a week of unemployment. Therefore, they have no application when the time comes to determine if a claimant has worked a full working week. The holding of a license is not in itself sufficient to support a finding that a person is not unemployed. Once it is found that a claimant had an interruption of earnings for the purpose of establishing a benefit period, the criteria applicable to determine whether persons who control their own working hours have a week of unemployment, will be applied to real estate agents and commission salespersons (FCA A-58-94, CUB 23879).With respect to employment, the question is not whether it was full or part time, but rather whether it was minor in extent (Digest  4.6.4.1; FCA A-697-95, CUB 29511).",31.986911764705923,19.355980392156862,17.315433740611066,22.80392156862745,22.88976470588235,12.304000000000002,70.73529411764706,12.0,3.589521285625791,0.8585085148896993,0.4764233102976845,0.0631737013103011,0.8918856143951416,0.9070509374141692,4.898039215686275,4.0,3.0789283974937613,42.5,38.0,22.1641602593015,1.5568627450980392,1.0,0.9265696596059404,255,137,0.5372549019607843,1279,6,4.7.4,Real estate agents or salespersons,Chapter 4 - Week of unemployment
190,190,"Any person who has been elected and holds the office of mayor or other office in a municipal council is considered to be in employment within the meaning in the regulatory provisions. It is also considered employment in respect of which the hours of work are controlled by the individual. This leads to a conclusion that any week within the term of an office is a full working week unless the activity required of the mandate is so minor in extent that a person would not normally follow it as a principal means of livelihood (EIR 30(1); EIR 30(2)).The office of mayor generally requires more time than that of other officials within the municipality council. The size of the community and the interest individuals may reflect in the exercise of their own mandate are other factors that have a bearing on the number of hours devoted to the office.As a general rule, the determination of whether officials within a municipal council must be regarded as working full working weeks will depend on the nature of the mandate and the size of the community.

191,191,"Professional people, such as doctors, lawyers or accountants, who carry on their activity in an independent office may easily be regarded as a distinct group when compared with independent workers who contract their services, and persons who operate a business on their own account. In fact, while they may not be primarily interested in conducting a business or in performing under a contract for services, they nevertheless become self-employed in order to pursue their own profession, and their activity generally requires the services of at least one employee who looks after administrative work.As such, claimants who find themselves in this category of workers would be considered working full weeks and would not be eligible for EI benefits. Very exceptional circumstances would have to be proven on behalf of an individual to show that such employment is so minor in extent that a person would not normally follow it as a principal means of livelihood.Appendix A - Type of contractDifference between a contract of service and a contract for servicesContract of serviceA contract of service is an arrangement (either written or oral) whereby an individual, the employee, agrees to work on a full-time or part-time basis for the other party to the contract, the employer, for either a specified or indeterminate period of time.Under such a contract, one party (the employee), serves another party (the employer), in return for a salary or some other form of remuneration. The employer has the right of control and can direct the manner in which the employee carries out the duties to be performed.Contract for servicesA contract for services is an arrangement whereby one party agrees to perform certain specific work for another party, as stipulated in a contract; it usually calls for the accomplishment of a clearly defined task, but does not normally require the party paying for the service to do anything themselves. There is no right to control the methods of work and no boss/employee relationship.Difference between a contact of service and a contract for servicesContract of serviceContract for servicesIndicates an employer/employee relationship.Indicates a principal (payer) to independent contractor (worker) relationship.One party agrees, for either a period of time or indefinitely, to work either full or part time, for another party.

192,192,"The Employment Insurance Act (EIA) is an insurance plan under which beneficiaries are provided with monetary assistance when they become unemployed and suffer a financial loss. Once a claim is established, claimants must demonstrate that each week of benefit claimed is a week of unemployment and that no circumstances or conditions exist that would disentitle or disqualify them from receiving benefits.One of the circumstances or conditions that would reduce benefits payable is the receipt of moneys or non-pecuniary (non-monetary) benefits that are considered earnings for EI purposes. Any compensation received for the loss of employment, as well as any wages, salary and any other pecuniary or non-pecuniary benefits related to, attached to, or arising out of employment, reduces or nullifies the financial loss incurred by the claimant. In order to prevent double indemnification, these benefits and advantages will be deducted from EI benefits.This chapter discusses the determination and allocation of earnings to be deducted from EI benefits. Other impacts of earnings on a claim for benefits can be found in other chapters of this Digest (Digest Chapter 1, Digest Chapter 2).Determining that moneys are insurable is different than determining whether they are earnings for the purposes of paying EI benefits. Therefore, the earnings provisions covered in this chapter are not relevant to whether or not earnings are insurable (EIA 90). As well, the treatment of moneys under the Income Tax Act, or any other legislation, does not have any bearing on whether earnings are allocated under the EI legislation.There are special provisions in place for the consideration of earnings while a claimant is participating in the Work-sharing program (EIA 24; EIR 47; Digest Chapter 25).",39.01200000000003,14.823602836879434,16.52667757954773,19.081418439716312,17.322340425531912,13.92652482269504,63.306382978723406,9.9,3.391034905717638,0.8949379685526657,0.4672198399704131,0.0551326026533326,0.8719564543830024,0.8550985381007195,5.23404255319149,4.0,3.085399839308026,28.2,28.5,9.086253353280435,1.6453900709219855,1.0,1.0009552301014122,282,136,0.4822695035460992,1513,10,5.1.0,Overview,Chapter 5 - Earnings

194,194,"The Commission's role is to determine:what moneys are earnings within the meaning of the EI Act and Regulations (Digest 5.2.0)when the earnings are paid or payable (Digest 5.6.1)why the earnings are paid or payable (that is, the reason for the payment), andthe start date of the period to which the earnings will be allocated (Digest 5.6.0)In order to make these determinations, the true nature of the payments must be established. When doubt exists about the true nature of a payment and the claimant has been unable to provide this information, the Commission will assist the claimant in obtaining or clarifying the evidence by contacting the employer or any other party.Claimants frequently contact the Commission to determine what effect the payment of moneys will have on their claim for benefits. When claimants make personal choices regarding moneys based on incorrect information provided or action taken by the Commission regarding their earnings, there could be negative results to the claimant. In these situations however, claimants cannot obtain relief from those results based on the fact they were given incorrect information; the legislation governing the determination and allocation of earnings must be applied (FCA A-2-05, CUB 62223).In all cases, the primary question to satisfy when considering the impact of moneys on the payment of EI benefits is why those moneys are paid. It is crucial that all facts and evidence concerning the moneys and why they are paid, be obtained before a decision is made.

195,195,"The Commission, with the approval of the Governor in Council, has the authority to make regulations that specify and clarify what constitutes earnings (EIA 54(s)). EIR 35 was made under that authority. Its purpose is to determine what moneys are or are not earnings for benefit purposes. The moneys concluded to be earnings are used in determining the amount to be deducted from EI benefits or whether an interruption of earnings has occurred. In some cases, they are also taken into account to determine the amount of benefits to be repaid to the Commission by the claimant, the employer, or a trustee in bankruptcy, under certain circumstances (EIR 35(2); EIA 45, EIA 46).This authority is limited to include only those moneys or advantages that are earned by labour, or that resemble such (FCA A-178-86). Moneys or advantages are considered earned by labour, or resemble them, when they relate to, are attached to, or arise out of employment. The moneys must clearly demonstrate the character of a consideration given in return for work done by the recipient (FCA A-597-94, CUB 25472). This is not the case for moneys received from investment or capital, through chance, through charity, or through a personal relationship (Digest 5.3.1).Generally, earnings are any moneys paid for wages, salary, pecuniary benefits and all other advantages, pecuniary or non-pecuniary, which are related to, attached to or arising out of employment (Digest 5.3.0). Any compensation for the loss of any of these types of income is also earnings for EI benefit purposes, including income replacement payments through a motor vehicle insurance plan.Conversely, payments made for reasons unrelated to employment, such as alimony, lottery winnings and inheritances, are not earnings for benefit purposes. Similarly, any compensation for losses totally unrelated to employment is not earnings (FCA A-34-91, CUB 17395A). For example, settlements paid to address injury to a claimant's health or reputation or to compensate for pain or suffering resulting from an accident are not earnings (Digest 5.12.11; Digest 5.11.4; Digest 5.11.8).The true nature of the payments must be established to determine whether they are advantages related to, attached to, or arising out of employment. Relying solely on what the parties call the moneys is sometimes insufficient, as the name given to a payment does not necessarily determine its true nature (FCA A-599-92, CUB 20965). When doubt exists about the true nature of a payment, the best way to clarify the issue is to examine the intentions of the parties, by reviewing all relevant documents and contacting all the parties involved. Although the onus of proof is on the claimant, the Commission may assist in providing or clarifying the evidence by contacting the employer or any other party.When terms are not defined in the EI legislation, the meaning given individual words must be examined in the context in which they are used in the legislation. Dictionaries and jurisprudence may often provide further clarification.The earnings to be taken into account are the gross earnings before any deductions such as income tax, CPP, QPP or EI premiums (CUB 79991). Amounts may be deducted from the gross earnings, such as legal fees incurred to receive those earnings (Digest 5.3.3), or deductions from self-employment (Digest 5.16.0).

203,203,"Earnings for benefit purposes include the entire income arising out of employment (EIR 35(2)). In fact, any moneys or non-pecuniary benefits received from employment cannot be excluded from the broad characterization of the entire income of a claimant arising out of any employment, unless expressly excluded by the regulations, jurisprudence or policy (EIR 35(7); Digest 5.5.0). This is especially so when specific provisions concerning the allocation of the moneys exist, such as vacation pay (EIR 36, 36(8)). Some earnings are specifically indicated in EIR 35(2) for clarity and to prevent any misinterpretation (Digest 5.4.0).The concept of the entire income arising out of employment can be divided into two major components; the entire income, and arising out of employment. Determination of whether moneys are part of the entire income arising out of employment examines whether the payment arises out of employment and if so, whether it is income for the purpose of the act (Digest 5.3.1, Digest 5.3.2, Digest 5.3.3).",38.05634782608698,15.950608695652177,15.903189008614271,19.091180124223605,19.156149068322986,13.84944099378882,62.63478260869566,9.8,4.177205799170088,0.8910504785047291,0.4906448399423109,0.0463944974800446,0.9033502489328384,0.9041795333226522,5.198757763975156,4.0,3.031552245278954,32.2,41.0,12.253978945632312,1.608695652173913,1.0,0.9663526422127334,161,86,0.5341614906832298,867,5,5.3.0,The entire income arising out of employment,Chapter 5 - Earnings
204,204,"EIR 35(2) stipulates that earnings include the entire income of a claimant arising out of any employment. In order to determine if moneys arise out of employment, the meaning of the term employment must be examined.Pursuant to EIR 35(1) employment means:any employment, whether insurable, not insurable or excluded employment, under any express or implied contract of service or other contract of employment whether or not services are or will be provided by a claimant to any person, andwhether or not income received by a claimant is from a person other than the person to whom services are or will be provided, andany self-employment whether on the claimant's own account or in partnership or co-adventure, andthe tenure of an office as defined by the Canada Pension PlanSometimes, it is not obvious whether the moneys arise out of employment (Digest 5.3.1.1, Digest 5.3.1.10). What must be determined is whether an employment relationship exists between the person who makes the payment, and the one who receives it. It may be useful in these situations to refer to the general definition of the term employment found in the dictionary, to complement the meaning of employment as stated in the regulation. The dictionary definitions generally refer to an employer-employee relationship and the fact that the employer or the person to whom the service is due, both selects and compensates the employee, or person rendering the service. In other words, the person for whom the work is done has the power to hire and fire the person who is performing the service, and agrees to pay that individual for the services performed. In addition, employment usually includes some degree of control by the person employing, over the product or service produced, as well as the time taken to do so.Simply being an employee of an employer is not sufficient to establish that any payment made by that employer arises out of employment. In order to arise out of employment, the payment must display the character of compensation given in return for the work done by the recipient. It must arise out of the employment itself, and not merely as a consequence of the employment status of the recipient (FCA A-597-94, CUB 25472).Employment under any express or implied contract of service requires that there be an employer-employee relationship and that the relationship involves some form of remuneration or material benefit that may be direct or indirect, immediate or eventual.Employment clearly includes the traditional situation where a claimant works under a contract of service for an employer, whether or not the employment is insurable. It also includes excluded employment as stated in EIA 5(2), employment anywhere in the world, or employment under a contract of service with the Reserve or Regular Armed Forces (EIA 5(1)).Employment may also include situations where services are not performed. The issue to be addressed is whether there is an express or implied contract of service, or other contract of employment. Claimants, who after lay-off, continue to receive their salary and most of the benefits of the other employees, are under a continuing employment relationship with the employer, even though no work or services are expected or performed (CUB 69694).Employment under any other contract of employment includes any employment that may not clearly be an express or implied contract of service. It includes situations where a claimant has accepted an offer of employment and the employer withdraws the offer before any actual services are performed. In this situation, a contract of employment was formed, therefore any moneys received as a result of the breach of that contract are considered earnings as they are income arising out of employment (FCA A-1205-88, CUB 15956). It also includes situations where a claimant receives moneys because the employer bypassed that claimant's recall rights and hired someone else with less seniority. However, employment does not include cases where a person receives compensation for not being hired by an employer, where that person has no recall rights or connection with the employer.Self-employment, whether on one's own account or in a partnership or co-adventure, is included in the meaning of employment (Digest 5.16.0). Employment exists when a claimant is engaged in the operation of a business, or operating as an independent worker or contractor (Digest 4.6.0).Tenure of an office is included in the meaning of employment as defined in the Canada Pension Plan Act:office means the position of an individual entitling him to a fixed or ascertainable stipend or remuneration and includes a judicial office, the office of a minister of the Crown, the office of a lieutenant governor, the office of a member of the Senate or House of Commons, a member of a legislative assembly or a member of a legislative or executive council, and any other office the incumbent of which is elected by popular vote or is elected or appointed in a representative capacity, and also includes the position of a corporation director, and officer means a person holding such an office.Examples of a person holding tenure of an office are a mayor, council member, chairperson or member of a board of referees, school trustees, or members of the board of directors of a corporation.Employment can be said to exist even if the claimant receives the income from a person other than the person with whom the contract of service exists or existed, and for whom the services are or will be performed (EIR 35(1)). This other person could be someone who stands in the place of an employer or the employer's successor, if the business is sold. It could also be a customer who tips a server. However, a clear connection must be established between the employment or employer and the other person, in order for the moneys to be considered arising out of employment (FCA A-486-95, CUB 28503). Examples of any other person, as envisioned by the regulation, are a Workers' Compensation Board, an insurance company paying wage-loss insurance benefits, an administrator of a pension fund, or a wage protection fund (Digest 5.12.9).Alimony, lottery winnings or inheritances do not arise out of employment, as these moneys are clearly not received by reason of an employment relationship.",35.55120370370372,17.869722222222226,16.816750354323865,21.368945868945872,21.17999002849003,12.58276923076923,69.67236467236467,12.0,3.5149555357134554,0.9165756463174958,0.4726990526402475,0.0622375742367129,0.883207903458522,0.8743827486038208,4.957692307692308,4.0,2.9587124378588787,38.51851851851852,30.0,28.308316237027995,1.5625,1.0,0.8354740133140449,1040,319,0.3067307692307692,5285,27,5.3.1,Arising out of employment,Chapter 5 - Earnings

206,206,"Employment includes situations where individuals play sports or games for payment, if there is an employer-employee relationship, or if the player has entered into a contract for service.When a person plays games or sports under a contract of employment, employment clearly exists. This includes those who play professional and non-professional sports for a team or organization under contracts of service (CUB 76213).Employment also includes situations where a person receives a guaranteed prize as payment for participating in an event, no matter whether the person wins or loses. When a prize is guaranteed in this way in order to attract players, the prize constitutes payment by the promoters for the player's participation in the event. A contract for service has formed between the player and the promoter. In the same way, there is employment when a player signs a contract with a company to endorse products or to appear on their behalf.On the other hand, employment does not include situations where an athlete competes in sports or games without any guarantee or assurance of receiving a prize. In that event, there is no contract of service or contract for service employment between the athlete and the event organizers, as there is no assurance of material benefit (CUB 38453).

207,207,"Union members may receive strike benefits from their union during periods of unemployment. During a labour dispute, these moneys are normally paid out of a strike fund that is comprised of union dues paid by the members while employed. Strike benefits may be given to all members, or to members based on a limited criteria established by the union membership. These moneys may be received for picketing or performing other tasks, such as distributing material, or caring for picketers' children.The essential elements of employment are missing when individuals who are members of a union picket, or perform related activities, and receive strike pay. Therefore, strike pay is not earnings because:union members are not performing any services for the union itself, nor are they receiving any form of remuneration or material benefit of any kind for servicesthe activities performed are only activities on the union members' own behalf, in their pursuit of a contract with their employerthese activities are part of the contract negotiation process and are activities for which union members volunteer, or pursue for their own benefitthe union does not have an employer-employee relationship with its members, andthe union is not compensating members for any services. It is merely distributing moneys set aside from union dues or other sources, for later use during labour disputesHowever, any activities performed for the union itself in conducting the business of the union, (such as being part of the negotiating team for which compensation is received) are considered employment if it can be established that the union is paying for services performed.",30.96637404580156,18.23844056706652,16.439396014739867,20.772955288985827,21.93088876772083,14.1781679389313,68.72628135223556,11.714285714285714,3.308492720759802,0.9700082747393848,0.4657908574057642,0.043266362696942,0.9030214548110962,0.8745038270950317,5.232824427480916,5.0,2.9061646178370872,37.42857142857143,24.0,28.070610675107684,1.6297709923664123,1.0,0.8760768428502174,262,125,0.4770992366412214,1398,7,5.3.1.3,Strike benefits,Chapter 5 - Earnings
208,208,"Generally, benevolent or volunteer work is work performed without any expectation of monetary reward. It lacks the elements of employment in that the individual is not usually selected to perform the service (they volunteer), and there is no expectation to receive any remuneration or material benefit (CUB 74353). A person engaged in such volunteer work is not bound under a contract of service. The absence of such contract is a decisive factor in determining whether the benevolent work is considered employment. Therefore, in the absence of a contract of service, a claimant who provides services as a benevolent gesture is considered not to be in employment. This is true even if, in some very unusual instances, the claimant may receive certain benefits by living on the premises, such as room and board, without any obligation to perform services (CUB 21373; Digest 4.5.6).Benevolent or volunteer work for a friend, a relative or a spouse is generally not considered employment, as there is no contract of service (Digest 4.1.5, Digest 4.5.4, Digest 4.5.5). The performance of services is more related to the personal relationship with the person, and there is no expectation of receiving any remuneration or material benefit. Benevolent or volunteer work is considered employment only when the volunteer receives, or expects to receive, remuneration or material benefit (CUB 42191). In that situation, it can no longer be said that it is benevolent work, as on one side there is an expectation of services to be rendered, and on the other side, there is an expectation of payment. Any income, whether pecuniary or non-pecuniary, received by the claimant is then considered to be arising out of employment.Benevolent or volunteer work for a spouse who is under a contract of service, is considered employment only if the contractual relationship applies to both spouses. If the spouse is self-employed, consideration is given to the nature of the duties and responsibilities carried out by each spouse in the operation of the business. If it appears that the claimant is not particularly concerned with the business, but merely helps out on occasion, the assistance given is not regarded as employment (Digest 4.5.5). However, if the efforts go beyond merely helping out, the individual may be found to be in self-employment (Digest 4.6.9).  Digest 5.3.3.2 provides additional information on whether moneys paid to one spouse by the spouse holding the contract can be deducted as an expense.When the benevolent or volunteer work is performed for an employer, the issue again is whether there is a contract of service between both parties. This requires the existence of an employer-employee relationship and involves some form of remuneration or material benefit, direct or indirect, immediate or eventual. The very essence of the employer-employee relationship, when volunteer work is performed for an employer, is the fact that the worker will obtain, or hopes to obtain, a benefit or profit from the work. This is the case when a volunteer fire fighter receives remuneration, whether periodically or in a lump sum, for acting as a member of a fire department. The remuneration and its expectation make this employment. Where no remuneration is promised for the volunteer work, the person may simply hope to obtain regular paid employment from that employer in the future (FCA A-1009-90, CUB 18752). Where it is found that there is an employer-employee relationship, any income received by the claimant, whether pecuniary or non-pecuniary,  is considered to be arising out of employment. However, if the claimant receives no income, a value cannot be affixed to the services  It then becomes an issue of whether or not the claimant is actually unemployed (Digest chapter 4), or available for work (Digest chapter 10).",42.88770542958187,14.049713612093472,15.335164690037953,17.602912419388392,15.630243395048886,12.36414673046252,60.1157339990292,8.956521739130435,3.295281358043547,0.672401040252386,0.459519174250701,0.0478674060960872,0.8933646407994357,0.8889160326548985,4.974481658692185,4.0,3.0160632437820234,27.26086956521739,26.0,11.002835173379268,1.6108452950558214,1.0,0.9888100012088382,627,207,0.3301435406698564,3211,23,5.3.1.4,Benevolent or volunteer work,Chapter 5 - Earnings
209,209,"Moneys or any other material benefits received as a gift, but not given in consideration of services performed, do not arise out of employment.When helping out a friend or relative, a gift is considered arising out of employment if the individual performing the services expects these moneys or a material benefit. In this case, the gift is linked to the performance of service with the expectation of payment, as the assistance is not freely given to a friend or a relative (Digest 5.3.1.4).A gift arises out of employment only if the employee receives the gift because of the employer's custom to give such gifts to all employees, or if the employer gives some indication that the gift is related to employment.A gift is not arising out of employment when an employee receives it from a personal friend who also happens to be their employer, such as a wedding present. The gift in those cases arises out of the personal relationship with the employer and not the employer-employee relationship.Gifts from customers, such as tips, arise out of employment when they occur in recognition for the service provided or work performed. If it were not for the services provided by the individual for the customer involved, the gift would not have been given (Digest 5.14.7). However, a gratuity related to a personal relationship, rather than the service or the work performed, cannot be said to arise out of employment and is not earnings for EI benefit purposes.",46.86265,14.4863,16.061879428645646,19.06,16.558079999999997,11.17104,60.05,9.0,3.2113240998257977,0.5895179624661762,0.4889979215870557,0.041608351336188,0.9068782925605774,0.9050279955069224,4.748,4.0,2.7965149740346464,31.25,26.0,15.155444566227676,1.516,1.0,0.8998577665386903,250,106,0.424,1214,8,5.3.1.5,Gifts,Chapter 5 - Earnings
210,210,"A return on investment, or a return on capital, are those moneys that are derived from the ownership of an asset, and the result of the performance of the funds or property invested, rather than the work of the investor.A return on investment is not the result of involvement in the actual operation of a business on the owner's own account, or in a partnership or co-adventure. Only when there is involvement in the operation of a business, can it be said that there is work performed by the person. When there is only an investment of funds or capital and no participation by the owner, the investor is not engaged in the operation of the business and there is no element of employment. Moneys gained from a return on investment or a return on capital do not arise out of employment or self-employment.Although generally there is no work or labour when there is a return on investment, there may be some small element of participation by the owner, in the operation of a business owned as an investment. As long as the nature of the participation demonstrates only a natural concern for an investment, that participation is not enough to change moneys arising out of an investment to moneys arising out of self-employment (Digest 4.6.3.2). In determining this, the decisive factor is the nature of the activities of the person in the operation of the business, and not necessarily the amount of time spent. If the activities performed are in the nature of a person engaged or involved in the operation of a business, then the moneys earned arise out of employment, and not from a return on investment (CUB 68317; Digest 4.6.3).If the activities are in the nature of concern with how others operate the business, or concern with protecting the investment itself, then the moneys are a return on investment. Without the element of engagement or involvement in the operation of a business, the individual is neither engaged in self-employment, nor engaged in the operation of a business on their own account, or in a partnership or co-adventure. As such, any moneys derived from the business are not considered earnings for EI benefit purposes. A return on investment, or a return on capital, may result from:the investment of moneysthe acquisition, holding, or disposal of property or securities (stocks, bonds, notes, convertible debentures, warrants, or other documents that represent a share in a company or debt owed by a company), orthe contribution of money or property to a business venture so that it may produce revenueA return on investment is normally in the form of interest, dividends, rent, pay out of equity, profits or capital gains (FCA A-572-95, CUB 28759; CUB 35113).Royalties are paid to the owner of a property for the use of that property. Whether these royalties are considered a return on investment depends on why these moneys were paid. Royalties paid to the creator of a property, such as, computer software, a song, a book, a commercial, or record royalties paid to the composer, author, or singer, are not considered a return on investment. These royalties are the result of labour by the actor, composer, author, or singer, therefore are earnings arising out of employment (CUB 78103). Royalties paid to the owner of a property, based on the mere ownership of that property (gas, oil or mining properties), are not earned by the property owner's labour, and therefore are considered a return on investment.Interest, which is earned on a saving's account, a certificate of deposit, or a loan, arises solely from the moneys in the account, on deposit or on loan. The interest does not arise from any labour by the person who owns the account, who placed the moneys on deposit, or who made the loan. It arises exclusively from the use of the money itself. As a result, the interest earned is a return on investment. This is true even if the interest is paid by an employer to compensate for an administrative delay in payment of moneys owed to a claimant.Income earned by investment alone is not earnings, even if the claimant spends a substantial amount of time following the progress of the investment. Regardless of the amount of time spent by the person, the money is still earned by the investment itself and not the labour, participation, or involvement of the investor in the earning process.",48.48795838675839,14.553935190581658,14.981290276393054,18.28222403543537,16.758973073784823,10.716890080428955,57.769903252127285,8.217391304347826,3.0387503977005204,0.8112271333759761,0.5106552970934167,0.0528506195651947,0.8808707621964541,0.8704574505488077,4.664879356568365,4.0,2.884789508479495,32.43478260869565,29.0,19.15798411596386,1.482573726541555,1.0,0.822173815831173,746,212,0.2841823056300268,3592,23,5.3.1.6,Return on investment or on capital,Chapter 5 - Earnings
211,211,"A grant is the giving or gifting of land or money. This may be given in exchange for something on the part of the recipient. It may also be given conditional on the production of a service or a product.When a grant is given on the condition that the grant recipient performs some activity or supplies a product to the grant giver, a contract for service is formed. Under a contract for service, the self-employed contract worker or independent contractor is required to produce a given result within a set period. In these situations, the payer is not normally involved in the performance of the work, nor do they have control over the manner in which the work is performed. A contract for service falls under the definition of self-employment.A grant does not arise out of employment if it is given as a gift, and is in no way related to a service, labour, or a product. A grant arises out of employment only if given on the condition that the recipient provide a service, labour, or a product.Any money paid to compensate the grant recipients for their time or effort arises out of employment. However, any moneys paid to compensate for items unrelated to the actual labour performed by the claimant, such as, equipment purchased or expenses incurred, do not arise out of employment.A subsidy is defined as a grant of money made by the government in aid of the promoters of any enterprise, work or improvement in which the government desires to participate, or which is considered a proper subject for government aid, because such purpose is likely to be of benefit to the public. A subsidy, like a grant, may be given on the condition that a product or a service is provided. If a contract is formed between the subsidy recipient and the government, whereby there is payment per unit produced, there is an employment relationship formed. The subsidy must have some connection to the labour performed by the subsidy recipient, or there cannot be employment.For individuals engaged in self-employed activities in farming, income from farming is the gross income, including any subsidies they receive under a federal or provincial program, remaining after deducting the operating expenses, other than capital expenditures (EIR 35(10)(b)). Although all subsidies could be included in the income from self-employment in farming, only income support subsidies are included (Digest 5.16.2.5).

212,212,"An executor is someone appointed to carry out the directions and requests in a will, and to dispose of property according to the will's stated provisions. A person carrying out the provisions of a will may charge a fee for their services. If the individual acts as an executor for a fee, a contract for service has been formed. Any moneys arising out of the services performed are arising out of employment (FCA A-061-10, CUB 73843). However, only the moneys that are paid for the services performed in connection with acting as the executor under the will, are considered earnings arising out of employment.Any property or money received under the provisions of a will is an inheritance, and arises out of the individual's personal relationship to the deceased.

213,213,"Students may receive moneys from various sources while attending courses of instruction. The question to be determined is whether an employment relationship exists between the individual who makes the payment, and the student who receives it. Unless it is clear that an employment relationship exists, moneys received while attending a course of instruction do not arise out of employment.Moneys arise out of employment when a student has a contract of employment with the training institution, regardless of whether services are performed. This is also true if the student receives any moneys with the requirement that the student performs research work or assists a professor in teaching or marking duties. When this occurs, there is an employer-employee relationship formed (CUB 35307, CUB 38538). If such an employee-employer relationship does not exist, any moneys received from an educational institution do not arise out of employment.Employers may supplement their employees' EI benefits during a period of unemployment while the employee is attending a course to which they were referred by an authority designated by the Commission. These supplemental payments make up the difference between the claimant's EI benefits and the employee's normal wages while employed. As these payments are moneys arising out of employment, they would normally be earnings to be deducted from EI benefits (EIR 16(1)). However, payments made by an employer to supplement EI benefits are excluded from consideration as earnings if they are made under a Supplementary Unemployment Benefit (SUB) Plan, which meets specific conditions (EIR 37).Where no SUB plan exists, allowances paid as income support while attending the course are considered earnings, and would be allocated to the period for which they are payable (EIR 36(5)). Allowances paid in respect of dependant care, travel, commuting, or a living-away-from-home or disability allowance do not arise out of employment, and as such are not earnings to be deducted from benefits (EIR 16(2)). Moneys may also arise out of employment when an employer pays a living allowance (other than a living-away-from-home allowance) to an employee or former employee while that individual is attending a course. This is so, whether this occurs during a period of employment or after, as part of a severance package. The portion paid as part of a severance package is paid by reason of a lay-off or separation, and is allocated in the specified manner (EIR 36(9); Digest 5.12.2.1).However, for students attending courses not sponsored by the Commission, any allowances paid for attendance at a course are deducted from EI benefits payable (EIA 19(4); EIR 16(1)).5.3.1.10 Foster careFoster care is acting in the place of a parent to provide a home for a child, even though that child is not related to the foster caregiver, either by blood or by legal ties. Foster care may be compared to benevolent or volunteer work and should not be considered employment, unless there is remuneration or some expectation of remuneration, in return for that care.Although expenses incurred in the raising of the foster child may be reimbursed on a per diem basis by the organization or another party, this in itself, is not sufficient remuneration or expectation of remuneration to consider foster care as a form of employment. The moneys received from an agency to compensate for expenses incurred in raising a foster child do not arise out of employment.However, if an individual enters into a contract for service with another party to provide foster care for a fee, in addition to or instead of expenses, then foster care is considered employment. The organization is paying the individual to care for the child, and for that care, the organization is willing to provide compensation, therefore an employment relationship is formed. Only the portion of the income that is the fee for the foster care would be income arising out of employment; any portion that is for expenses incurred is not part of the entire income (Digest 5.3.3.1). If expenses are not reimbursed, the operating expenses actually incurred may be deducted from any fees paid (EIR 35(10)(c); Digest 5.16.0).",43.834625668449206,14.823957219251335,16.018793980428352,18.95187165775401,17.80311898395722,12.927705882352942,61.20320855614973,9.363636363636363,3.293992235969732,0.7191897569646251,0.4907147547175017,0.0628797663612674,0.8669718106587728,0.8452530235052109,5.048529411764706,4.0,2.9673216605838744,30.90909090909091,26.0,17.328140777645977,1.5558823529411765,1.0,0.9106207244546044,680,234,0.3441176470588235,3531,22,5.3.1.9,Moneys paid while attending a course of instruction,Chapter 5 - Earnings
214,214,"This section deals only with income that arises out of employment. These earnings have been specifically included under EIR 35(2), as they are either related to, or attached to, employment. Other earnings that may fit the general definition of income, but do not necessarily arise directly out of employment, are discussed in section 5.4.0 of this Digest.Income is defined in EIR 35(1) as:any pecuniary or non-pecuniary income that is or will be received by a claimant from an employer or any other person, including a trustee in bankruptcy.Pecuniary is defined in the dictionary as, consisting of, or measured in money. Conversely non-pecuniary means consisting of, or measured in something other than money (Digest 5.3.2.1).In addition to the meaning of income provided in the regulations, the Commission also relies on its common dictionary meaning. The dictionary refers to income as a gain or recurrent benefit, usually measured in money that derives from capital or labour (CUB 80836). Although this definition includes moneys earned by capital, the wording of the legislation limits income to that which is earned by labour, or that resembles it (FCA A-597-94, CUB 25472).  In addition, the payment must be made to compensate for work performed, or to be performed by the employee, under the terms and conditions of employment, and not merely as a consequence of the recipient's employment status.In order for the payment to be considered income, a clear connection must be established between the employment or employer and the person receiving the payment. An example is a customer or client who makes payments to a self-employed person. Other examples of other person as envisioned by the regulation, are a government who makes payments under a wage protection fund (FCA A-486-95, CUB 28503), or an insurance company who pays lost wages to employees who are unable to work because of a motor vehicle accident (EIR 35(2)(d); FCA A-378-96, CUB 33206).The meaning given to the word income under any other legislation is not relevant and cannot be applied over the meaning clearly stated in the EI legislation (CUB 42860).Any moneys that arise from employment are income (Digest 5.3.1). Generally, income is any pecuniary or non-pecuniary benefits, such as, wages, salary, and all other advantages or employment-related benefits that are related to, attached to, or arising out of employment (Digest 5.3.2). As well, compensation for the loss of any of these benefits is income for EI benefit purposes.An employment-related benefit is something given by an employer to compensate the employee for work performed, in addition to the basic hourly wage or monthly salary. It is part of the total compensation package offered by an employer. It may include items required by labour laws, such as vacation pay and statutory holiday pay and items called fringe benefits (Digest 5.3.2.2). Payments that do not arise out of employment are not income for benefit purposes. This includes investment income, alimony, lottery winnings and inheritances.Any compensation for losses that are totally unrelated to the advantages arising out of employment, is not income (Digest 5.12.11). For example, settlements paid to address injury to one's health or reputation,  or for pain or suffering resulting from an accident (Digest 5.11.4, Digest 5.11.8), are not income, as these settlements are not for loss of wages or employment advantages (i.e. employment-related benefits).Moneys that are paid by an employer to reimburse or to compensate specifically for a job-related expense incurred or to be incurred by the employee, or a job-required consideration, are not income as there is no gain or benefit (Digest 5.3.3.1). These payments for job-related expenses and job-required considerations are not paid to compensate for work performed by that employee. Rather, they are intended to reimburse for the extra costs incurred in performing the job duties.Where no amount is paid to reimburse a specific job-related expense or to compensate for a job-required consideration supplied by the employee, these expenses may be deducted from the gross income, if they were incurred for the direct purpose of earning that income (Digest 5.3.3.2).The earnings to be taken into account are the claimant's gross earnings (FCA A-866-87, CUB 14091) which include the usual deductions, such as income tax, union dues, EI premiums, or the employee's own contributions to a pension or wage-loss insurance plan. The employer's share of the contributions to a pension fund is not included in the gross earnings of the claimant. The right to these employer contributions does not occur when they are earned, but rather only later when specific conditions have been fulfilled (Digest 5.13.0).Earnings paid in foreign funds are converted to Canadian dollars at the rate of exchange existing at the time the earnings were paid or payable.",44.70451815038896,14.67743445692884,15.350803472480044,18.26564870834534,17.470924805531546,12.573133583021216,61.01992701430903,9.307692307692308,3.127494230828904,1.0323858573565152,0.4974830509099389,0.067087080354209,0.8643372440338135,0.8559458057085673,4.98876404494382,4.0,2.8492938600869526,30.807692307692307,23.0,23.050144719667884,1.546816479400749,1.0,0.8335163709264125,801,289,0.3607990012484394,4131,26,5.3.2,The entire income,Chapter 5 - Earnings
215,215,"EIR 35(1) and 35(10)(d) to 35(16) provide for the inclusion of non-pecuniary income in the definition of income. They also specifically provide for the inclusion of board, living quarters and other benefits as income. They describe how to affix a value to board, living quarters and other benefits received from employment. Not all income that arises out of employment is received in the form of money (i.e. in a pecuniary form). The payment can also be non-pecuniary, meaning that the compensation consists of, or is measured in, something other than money.Non-pecuniary income received by a claimant from an employer or any other person, is included in the definition of income (Digest 5.3.2). It also includes any non-pecuniary items received by a self-employed claimant from a customer or a client.Non-pecuniary income includes the value of board; living quarters; heat, light, telephone, or other benefits included with those living quarters; any other benefits received in respect of employment; or any considerations furnished by an employer. The meaning of a consideration furnished by an employer as non-pecuniary income could be an item furnished or provided by an employer to an employee as payment for services rendered. For example, an automobile that the employee may use for personal use as well as for business (CUB 25241A).Non-pecuniary income received from an employer may be considered an employment-related benefit, in some cases. Examples of employment-related benefits as a consideration furnished by an employer are: appliances such as a refrigerator, washer and dryer (CUB 25101); the amount by which the rent was reduced (CUB 68316; CUB 20684); free meals; and free attendance at a course in exchange for services performed (CUB 23722).The claimant and the employer should agree on a reasonable value of the board, living quarters and any other non-pecuniary benefits. If the claimant and the employer disagree on the value, or the value appears unreasonable, the value must be determined by the Commission. The Commission's determination of the value of living quarters must be based on the rental rates for similar accommodation in the same vicinity or district (EIR 35(14)). However, the Commission cannot affix a dollar amount for wages or salary, when the claimant is providing services but not receiving money or other non-pecuniary benefits (Digest 5.3.1.4).Often the question is not whether a payment is non-pecuniary, but whether it arises out of employment (Digest 5.3.1). When a non-pecuniary benefit arises out of employment, it is earnings to be deducted from EI benefits.A written contract of employment is not required in order for non-pecuniary benefits or considerations to be income arising out of employment. It is sufficient to show that the claimant is receiving non-pecuniary income or considerations from self-employment or under an express, implied or other contract of employment (EIR 35(1)). In a barter situation, although there is no money exchanged for services rendered, the value of the items exchanged is still considered income (Digest 5.3.1.1). Conversely, the value of free accommodation is not income when the services provided by a claimant are of a volunteer or benevolent nature. In this situation, there is no requirement that the claimant perform services. There is no employment and therefore, no income for the purposes of the regulations (Digest 5.3.1.4). In addition, the value of a personal gift from an employer is not income, as it does not arise out of employment (Digest 5.3.1.5).",47.55987731991195,13.152557407989937,14.424011203321124,16.460648002516518,15.288958792072982,12.51404844290657,57.58760616546084,8.227272727272727,3.211261065532275,0.6772130156991659,0.476943015793649,0.0553501560073111,0.8574219487962269,0.8547568500041962,5.006920415224913,4.0,2.927016596518718,26.272727272727277,23.0,12.64257532086725,1.5674740484429066,1.0,0.907359864699228,578,190,0.328719723183391,2999,22,5.3.2.1,Non-pecuniary income,Chapter 5 - Earnings
216,216,"Fringe benefits are a type of employment-related benefit or advantage that are paid by an employer in addition to basic wages. Fringe benefits form part of the entire income arising out of employment. Examples of fringe benefits are pensions, personal use of a company car, health care plan coverage, holiday trips, other prizes or incentive awards, reduced interest on loans and mortgages, or staff discounts on product purchases.Any insurance type of fringe benefit, or any of the following types of fringe benefits are not allocated against EI benefits, where this advantage is not a normal part of the wages (CUB 23722):savings obtained by financing or purchasing through the employer (reduced interest on loans and mortgages, staff discounts on product purchases or subsidized meals), orfree use of an employer's product or service (free transportation for airline, rail, bus employees or car rental employees, free hotel rooms for hotel employees, free or subsidized course attendance for school employees or their dependants)However, moneys paid in lieu of the above fringe benefits are allocated as any other benefit arising out of employment.

217,217,"A northern or isolation allowance is part of a person's wages or salary. It takes the form of a higher wage or salary, or is given in a lump-sum allowance payment. It is an employment-related benefit to attract employees to work in unusual or less favourable circumstances. Its purpose is to assist employees in coping with the high cost of living in northern or isolated areas. It is not a reimbursement of expenses. A parallel may be drawn between a northern allowance or an isolation allowance and situations where an employer factors the cost of living in the community where the claimant works, into the calculation of wages or salary. Regardless of whether the money is paid in the form of increased wages or salary, or as an allowance, it is income.The total wages or salary must be allocated, and, if an amount is paid separately in the form of an allowance, it must also be allocated in the same manner as wages or salary (EIR 35(4)). Additional costs of living in the isolated or northern areas cannot be deducted since they are not job-related expenses, because they were not incurred for the direct purpose of earning the income (Digest 5.3.3.2).",62.86297195253508,10.177443365695796,12.650343791298138,14.00992448759439,11.300900755124054,9.480970873786404,47.16073354908306,5.555555555555555,2.960053243083067,0.7287270515150357,0.4837061480732556,0.0671383522097724,0.8787289708852768,0.8625880479812622,4.519417475728155,4.0,2.687098202158625,22.88888888888889,19.0,10.321977033327638,1.4271844660194175,1.0,0.7386939635583402,206,96,0.4660194174757281,958,9,5.3.2.3,Northern allowance or isolation allowance,Chapter 5 - Earnings

219,219,"While employed, claimants may incur expenses and supply considerations. In general terms, an expense is a cost incurred while performing work, and a consideration is an item provided by one person to another.This section covers the effect of expenses incurred and other considerations supplied by a claimant who is not engaged in self-employment. Expenses for persons engaged in self-employment or in farming are discussed in section 5.16.5 of this Digest chapter. In addition, more information on expenses that are compensated on termination of employment can be found in section 5.12.2.1.An employer may specifically compensate expenses and considerations. Job-related expenses and job-required considerations, which are specifically compensated by an employer, are not income for EI benefit purposes, as they are not a gain or a benefit (Digest 5.3.3.1).An employer may require an employee to incur an expense in the performance of their job, or to supply a consideration, yet not be willing to compensate for it. If they are job-related expenses or job-required considerations, these expenses and considerations may be deducted from the entire income earned from that employment (Digest 5.3.3.2).",40.37882352941179,14.26386554621849,14.554592549557764,16.675019098548514,16.988372803666927,14.37860962566845,63.07792207792208,9.714285714285714,2.8956669624371485,0.7088622690306084,0.5032672928635661,0.032634682219582,0.8771406908830007,0.8357460856437683,5.320855614973262,4.0,3.318034228211152,26.714285714285715,24.0,14.69416099499862,1.6470588235294117,1.0,0.9992132797145834,187,91,0.4866310160427807,1021,7,5.3.3,Expenses and considerations,Chapter 5 - Earnings
220,220,"An employer may specifically or directly compensate expenses or considerations. The reimbursement may occur before, at the time of, or after the expense was incurred or the consideration was supplied. The compensation may take the form of a payment for actual costs incurred; a fixed amount or flat rate such as a per diem; or a monthly allowance. A per diem is a daily allowance to cover daily expenditures incurred by an employee while performing duties for the employer. For example, a set daily amount to cover meals and incidentals, while out of town performing duties for the employer. Whether any compensation paid by an employer is income, depends on whether it is considered a gain or a benefit (Digest 5.3.2). If the expense or consideration was required of the employee to perform their job, reimbursement for that expense or consideration cannot be said to be a gain or a benefit, as the employee did not profit. As such, the amount received as compensation for the job-related expense or the job-required consideration is not considered income.A job-related expense is an expense incurred while engaged in activities on behalf of an employer. Job-related expenses that may be compensated by the employer include:per diem allowances covering accommodation and meal costs while away from the work area on businessa tire purchased by the employee for a company vehiclemoving costs incurred during a transfer from one work site to anothera golf club membership required to entertain clients, orjob-related training coursesNone of these expenses represent a gain for the employee, nor are they paid to compensate for any work performed by the employee. They are meant to pay for expenses that the employee would not have incurred if they were not engaged in activities on behalf of the employer.Not all expenses compensated by an employer are job-related expenses. An employer may reimburse an expense incurred by the employee as an employment-related benefit. An example of this may occur where an employer reimburses the cost of additional medical or dental insurance purchased by the employee, or a golf club membership purchased for recreation. In these situations, the employer is not compensating for business-related expenses that would not have occurred had it not been for the job duties or activities. As such, amounts reimbursed for these types of non-employment-related expenses are included as part of income (Digest 5.3.2.2).A job-required consideration is an item required by an employer, to be supplied by an employee in order to perform the employee's job duties. Some job-required considerations compensated by the employer may be a vehicle supplied by a pizza delivery driver or a courier; or a horse supplied by a ranch hand as required by some ranchers. Payments for job-required considerations are not to compensate for the work performed by the employee, but rather to reimburse them for the extra costs incurred in having to supply an item required to perform the duties of their employment.Not all considerations supplied by an employee that are compensated by an employer, are job-required considerations. If an employer pays for a bus pass that the employee purchased, where no business travel is required of the employee, this would not be considered a job-required consideration. It is an employment-related benefit and is income.The Commission does not require receipts when an employer compensates an employee for job-related expenses or job-required considerations. Generally, when reimbursing employees for expenses incurred, employers require sufficient proof to justify the expenditure. This proof may be that the actual expenditure was incurred, or simply that the activity was performed. When paying a fixed amount or a flat rate, the employer has already taken into consideration the costs on average that the employee would reasonably incur under the circumstances.",46.680687500000005,13.108062500000004,14.668281842747778,16.615000000000002,15.089265625000005,12.6550625,58.56875,8.44,2.921952948471778,0.5396101248195606,0.4792394440923053,0.0663222133286799,0.8339927047491074,0.812633102354796,5.0359375,4.0,3.064966720226135,25.6,21.0,14.27165021992902,1.5859375,1.0,0.9145297950825604,640,201,0.3140625,3297,25,5.3.3.1,Expenses or considerations specifically compensated by an employer,Chapter 5 - Earnings
221,221,"EIR 35(10)(a)(i) & (ii) provide for the deduction of expenses and considerations from income arising out of employment, for someone who is not self-employed.When the employer does not reimburse an expense or cost, it is still possible for the claimant to deduct these expenses from their gross income, if the expenses were incurred for the direct purpose of earning that income (EIR 35(10)(a)). However, the expense must somehow relate to the terms and conditions of employment or to the employees' performance of duties (that is, it must be a job-related expense).The purpose of EIR 35(10) is to allow for deductions from income when claimants have incurred job-related expenses to earn their income, or supplied job-required considerations, and their employer did not compensate them for that expense or consideration. A job-related expense is an expense that is incurred while engaged in activities on behalf of the employer. A job-required consideration is an item that an employer requires the employee to supply in order to perform their job duties.Employees may have to cover business expenses out of their wages, salary or commissions that are not reimbursed by the employer. Payments may be made by employees for items such as: hotels, meals and transportation costs when performing duties for the employer away from home; gasoline purchases; entertaining current or prospective customers; or the purchase of equipment that enables them to perform their duties. In all cases where a claimant requests a deduction of a job-related expense from income, receipts must be provided. Job-related expenses supported by proof are deducted from the claimant's gross income before earnings are allocated.Employees may incur expenses for personal well-being or personal circumstances in the normal course of their employment duties. These expenses or costs are generally incurred only indirectly for the purpose of earning income. They are not related to the terms and conditions of the employment, or to the employees' performance of duties. As a result, they cannot be deducted from the gross income. Examples of this type of expense are childcare or transportation to and from work (CUB 16269). However, if employees incur an expense such as childcare, for example, while performing activities that are outside the normal requirements of the employment, and are not compensated by the employer, it may be deducted from their income. Having to work overtime or to go out of town once or twice a year are examples of situations where these activities may be part of the normal requirements of the employment.Should the claimant expend more than the amount for which the employer compensates, this amount may be deducted from the wages or salary, provided the expense incurred is reasonable, supported by evidence, and was actually expended. In cases where the employer pays a flat rate or a fixed amount, this payment already takes into account the fluctuation in the expenses that an employee will incur. Unless special circumstances are demonstrated, a deduction for the additional amount expended is not allowed.When no amount is paid specifically to compensate for a consideration supplied, or the amount is inadequate compared to what employers normally pay, the value of a job-required consideration not compensated can be deducted from the gross income. This is true as long as employers customarily compensate this consideration in that occupation or industry. For instance, no deduction can be made for the tools that are customarily supplied by tradespersons, or for chain saws normally provided by persons employed in cutting lumber. However, it may be possible to deduct expenses incurred to operate them. The claimant's declaration as to the value of the consideration supplied is normally sufficient, if it is reasonable.A claimant working under a contract of employment may incur costs by engaging someone to assist in performing their job duties or to replace them when they do not work. However, as the contract of employment is with the claimant, any payment for wages or salary under that contract is part of the claimant's entire income arising out of employment. The person actually performing the duties is not the one employed by the claimant's employer, as no contract of employment exists between the employer and that person. As such, if the employer does not reimburse the wages of the person who actually performed the work, it may be possible for the claimant to deduct those wages. If the claimant can establish that moneys were actually paid to someone else to perform the claimant's duties, these moneys are expenses directly incurred in order to earn the income, and may be deducted from their income.",51.44681818181823,12.67971786833856,13.947489324950684,16.023287057769817,15.567134796238244,12.69901298701298,57.59068517689207,8.241379310344827,3.232155666372724,1.0352950758323016,0.4793718136752941,0.0657234768026972,0.8650652936526707,0.8657939500278897,5.036363636363636,4.0,2.865146993845172,26.55172413793104,24.0,11.81637148021265,1.518181818181818,1.0,0.8156309441604205,770,234,0.3038961038961039,3980,29,5.3.3.2,Expenses and considerations not specifically compensated by an employer,Chapter 5 - Earnings
222,222,"The authority given to the Commission to make regulations regarding earnings is limited to those moneys or advantages that are earned by labour or resemble them. EIR 35(2)(a) to (f) specifically includes some types of moneys that must be considered earnings because these moneys are either earned by labour, or resemble moneys that are earned by labour. The moneys must clearly display the character of a consideration given in return for work done by the recipient.The moneys listed in EIR 35(2) are intended to replace wages that have been lost for one of several specific reasons. The common characteristic of these moneys is that they are advantages that are related to, attached to, or arising out of employment.

224,224,"A relief grant is assistance freely given to alleviate hardship. Hardship includes, but is not restricted to, circumstances of personal destitution, emergency, or disaster. Hardship may also include the broader circumstance of financial or other difficulty, which does not necessarily amount to destitution, emergency or disaster (FCA A-597-94, CUB 25472).A relief grant is usually monetary, but sometimes may be non-pecuniary. It can be received from a federal, provincial or municipal authority; a charitable organization; a welfare agency; an employer; or other persons. A relief grant may be a one-time payment made for a special situation, such as where an individual encounters a family emergency or disaster, or it can be an ongoing payment from a welfare agency because the claimant's income is insufficient to meet basic needs. Payments that are in the nature of relief grants are not earnings. This is so even if the payment is non-pecuniary, or the claimant is required to perform work as a condition to receive that payment.Following are factors that may be considered when determining whether a payment constitutes a relief grant (FCA A-597-94, CUB 25472):the simple presence of hardship does not automatically qualify moneys as a relief granta payment is more likely to be a relief grant if the circumstances giving rise to it are unusual or rarethe fact that a situation may be sympathetic does not alone mean that moneys paid constitute a relief grantthe link between the loss suffered and the compensation offered must be consideredthe nature of the connection to employment must be examined, andconsideration of whether the payment is made voluntarily, or if there is a legal obligation to make itRelief grants originating from an employer are not as easily identified, due to the connection with employment. Therefore it is important to examine the true nature of the payment:whether the purpose of the payment is to assist in a personal situation or a disasterwhether the payment is conditional on the recipient providing some sort of service to the employer for the assistance, andwhether the assistance is freely given by the employer, without any legal obligationAn example of a relief grant is an employer freely giving monetary assistance to an employee whose house has burnt down and does not expect any additional service from the employee for the assistance.",27.19759643062756,20.120604490500863,18.363090066077017,23.787679907887163,24.015921128382267,13.473471502590677,76.30857800805987,14.333333333333334,3.437210105074721,1.182273614031666,0.4435544375445589,0.0477462804742161,0.8812606558203697,0.8657313500131879,5.095854922279793,4.0,3.0999972287617767,42.888888888888886,25.0,38.21996117343352,1.6088082901554404,1.0,0.9494067575210376,386,176,0.4559585492227979,2008,9,5.5.1,Relief grants,Chapter 5 - Earnings
225,225,"Often, a claimant may receive a supplement to their EI benefits during a period of unemployment, to make up the difference between the EI benefits and their normal wages while employed. As these payments are moneys arising out of employment, they would normally be earnings and therefore deducted from EI benefits. However, the Commission has recognized the benefit of such payments which have advantages for all parties. It helps the employee maintain a standard of living during a period of unemployment, and it may help the employer maintain a skilled work force during a period of temporary lay-off. As a result, the Commission has made regulations that exempt these types of payments from being considered earnings under certain circumstances. This does not mean that a claimant who is laid off and receiving supplemental payments from their employer is exempt from the requirement to be available for, and making efforts to find, other suitable employment (Digest 10.8.1). Two types of payments intended to supplement EI benefits, have been specifically excluded from consideration as earnings. The first type relates to those supplemental payments that are made by an employer to an employee during a period of unemployment due to a temporary stoppage of work, training, illness, injury or quarantine (EIR 37; Digest 5.5.2.1). The second type relates to supplemental payments made by an employer, or another person, to an employee, by reason of:pregnancy (EIA 22), orcaring for one or more children (EIA 23(1)), orcaring for or supporting a seriously or critically ill family member (EIA 23.1(2), EIA 23.2, EIA 23.3), orany combination of those reasons (EIR 38; Digest 5.5.2.2)",42.52156959933916,14.753655514250315,15.903189008614271,18.64700536968195,17.537195373812473,13.199851301115242,61.487401900041306,9.444444444444445,3.543761996550618,1.2565834235363686,0.476759022341649,0.041321931055691,0.8901155516505241,0.8710718836103167,5.100371747211896,4.0,2.917891204471967,29.88888888888889,31.0,12.440475557580806,1.58364312267658,1.0,0.8565688225306317,269,143,0.5315985130111525,1418,9,5.5.2,Payments supplemental to employment insurance benefits,Chapter 5 - Earnings
226,226,"Payments may be made to an employee to supplement EI benefits during periods of unemployment due to a temporary stoppage of work, training, illness, injury or quarantine. Payments made by an employer to supplement EI benefits are excluded as earnings if they are made under a Supplementary Unemployment Benefit (SUB) plan which meets specific conditions (EIR 37).SUB plans are reviewed at the national level to determine if all required conditions are met, and a list of plans that meet the conditions, is maintained. Any payment made under a SUB plan that does not meet all of the conditions, is treated as earnings and allocated to the period for which it is payable, depending on whether it is paid for a period of incapacity (EIR 36(12)(a), Digest 5.11.7), or for one of the other reasons (EIR 36(5), Digest 5.7.2.4).The combined weekly amount of the SUB payment, plus the EI benefit rate from that employment, cannot exceed 95% of the claimant's normal weekly earnings.

228,228,"An increase in wages or salary means that the wage or salary amount is augmented, enlarged, or expanded. This implies that an amount was added to the previous wages or salary, therefore resulting in a newly agreed rate of pay for the work performed. Often an increase of salary is given retroactively. This may be the case when workers continue to perform their duties at their former rate of pay while a new contract is negotiated. When the contract is finally signed and there is a new agreement that includes an increased salary, that new salary is often effective at an earlier date. In this case, payment must be made retroactively to compensate for the difference in pay under the old contract, and the increased salary under the new contract. In other cases, an employer may unilaterally give an increase in salary that may also be retroactive. These retroactive increases in wages or salary are specifically excluded from consideration as earnings during the benefit period and for interruption of earnings purposes, as they are considered to have been earned over the period worked (EIR 35(7)(d)).  However, these earnings could have an impact on the calculation of the amount of the claimant's weekly EI benefit because they may be insurable.A retroactive increase in wages or salary must be differentiated from a retroactive adjustment of wages or salary, which is considered to be earnings. A retroactive adjustment is a payment that is made to adjust the wages or salary so it reflects a salary that was already in place at the time that the work was performed. It is made to bring the employee's salary to the pay level that was in existence at the time the work was performed, but for some reason was not paid. This late payment may be due to a mistake or a delay by the employer; a disagreement between the employer and the employee as to the applicable rate of pay for the duties performed; or it could be due to an agreed condition that must be met before a higher rate of pay becomes applicable. For instance, substitute teachers may have their salary retroactively adjusted to the first day worked after having worked more than twenty days. Other situations may involve an employee who wins a grievance regarding the applicable salary for the work that was performed. In all of these situations, the adjustment of salary is not the result of a new agreement between the employer and the employee as to the rate of pay that must be paid for the work performed. In the case of a grievance, the settlement does not constitute a new work agreement, but rather a clarification of the original one. For the purposes of determining a claimant's benefit rate, a retroactive pay adjustment or increase is included in the pay period in which it is paid (EIR 23(1)(b)). If the payment is made after the claimant has returned to work, the benefit rate will not be adjusted as the earnings will be allocated to the period in which they are paid. Should the claimant be unemployed at the time of the payment, the earnings will be allocated to the last week in which the claimant had earnings (EIR 23 (1.1)). The benefit rate may need to be recalculated. For purposes of allocation of earnings to be deducted from EI benefits, the retroactive pay adjustment would be allocated to the period for which it is paid (period worked), and generally not to weeks during which EI benefits are claimed. However, if the claimant was or is in receipt of benefits during the period for which the pay adjustment is paid, the adjustment will be deducted from benefits.",59.26025946704068,11.69046283309958,13.306631327048002,15.492286115007012,13.90418022440393,10.387032258064515,51.150070126227206,6.521739130434782,3.1363638480821394,0.7229874931214788,0.452780675859242,0.058210361762539,0.8594774495471608,0.8743916636421567,4.640322580645162,4.0,2.7494257275703227,26.956521739130437,27.0,10.0107692484234,1.4209677419354838,1.0,0.7983121502783219,620,192,0.3096774193548387,2941,23,5.5.3,Retroactive increases in wages or salary,Chapter 5 - Earnings

230,230,"Once moneys that are paid or payable are determined to be earnings for benefit purposes, how those earnings are handled must be considered. EIR 36 describes the manner of allocating earnings, and the period to which they are allocated. Earnings from different employments are considered independently from one another, and may be allocated for the same weeks.When earnings are not allocated based on a claimant's normal weekly earnings, they are allocated to the applicable weeks, regardless of any other earnings allocated to those same weeks, whether from the same or different employments. This concurrent allocation may result in the earnings from separate employments in a week, exceeding the claimant's normal weekly earnings.When an allocation is based on normal weekly earnings, it takes into account all earnings from that employment during a specific period (Digest 5.6.3.1). This results in the total amount of earnings allocated from a particular employment, not exceeding the claimant's normal weekly earnings in any week. Allocation of the total of all earnings from the same employment using normal weekly earnings results in a consecutive rather than concurrent allocation of these earnings.When more than one type of earnings must be allocated, some earnings may be based on normal weekly earnings, whereas others are not.  In these cases, the earnings that are not allocated based on normal weekly earnings are allocated first. Then any earnings from the same employment that are based on normal weekly earnings are allocated, topping-up the first allocation from the same employment, to the normal weekly earnings from that employment in each week. This is a consecutive allocation. There is an exception for pension earnings, which are not taken into account in the allocation of other earnings from the same or other employment (EIR 36(16)).All earnings are allocated on a weekly basis (EIR 36(1)). A week for benefit purposes always begins on Sunday (EIA 2(1)). The amount of earnings allocated to a week will determine the amount to be deducted from benefits for that week (EIA 19).Shifts that start on Saturday and end on Sunday overlap two weeks. As wages are allocated to the period for which the services are performed, earnings that overlap Saturday and Sunday are allocated to two different weeks based on the hours worked in each week (EIR 36(4)).Earnings are not always payable for a period that coincides with a calendar week. When this occurs, the earnings are allocated for the number of days worked in a week, proportionate to the number of days worked in the entire period of the payment (EIR 36(3)).An allocation can only be made in dollars. Therefore, when the amount of earnings to be allocated to a week includes a fraction of a dollar, fifty cents ($0.50) or more is rounded up to the next dollar and, less than fifty cents is rounded down (EIR 36(20)).The manner in which income is treated under any other legislation, such as the Income Tax Act, may differ from that under the EIA. For example, termination moneys paid in one year, may be deemed income for that year under the Income Tax Act, but for EI benefit purposes, are allocated on a claim in the previous year, from the week of separation. However, each legislation has its own purpose and provisions. Other legislations do not take precedence over the EI legislation (FCA A-999-96, CUB 35986; CUB 68677). Even within the EI legislation, allocation for insurability and premium purposes, and allocation of earnings for benefit payment purposes, are made under two different regulations and as a result, one cannot take precedence over the other (Insurable Earnings and Collection of Premiums Regulations).",50.49264354066989,13.082260765550242,14.22525824180931,16.515071770334927,15.806487739234448,12.364539473684207,54.61004784688996,7.454545454545454,3.252765869472648,0.6556314167089778,0.4373821227537569,0.0568480100771733,0.837139775355657,0.8214825615286827,4.972039473684211,4.0,2.7231115713500937,27.63636363636364,24.0,13.854915289742856,1.5164473684210529,1.0,0.8388544882714014,608,192,0.3157894736842105,3106,22,5.6.0,The allocation of earnings under EIR 36,Chapter 5 - Earnings

Claimants have received payment when they physically hold the cheque or cash, when payment is deposited into their bank account, or when they receive non-pecuniary income. Claimants are also considered to have received payment when it is expected to be in their possession shortly, usually the next payment processing date. This commonly occurs with wages, salary, vacation pay paid with each pay, periodic pensions and termination moneys. Received applies equally to cases where the money is transferred directly by the employer to a RRSP, or paid in fulfilment of a debt (CUB 47731; CUB 68776).The claimant generally accepts an offer of payment by cashing the cheque or accepting a bank deposit. Even if the claimant does not cash the cheque, payment may still be considered received and accepted. Sometimes the employer delays issuing the cheque; the claimant delays picking up the cheque or does not cash it; or a court or tribunal has decided the issue and there is no further litigation. In these cases, the amount is considered paid. However, it is not considered paid if the amount and condition of payment are in dispute and the cheque is refused or returned (CUB 36736).If the claimant accepts an offer of money by cashing the cheque, the claimant cannot invalidate that payment by any subsequent repayment arrangements. Only if the money was paid by mistake or not legally due, would the Commission accept repayment arrangements, and no longer consider the earnings paid.",61.507689393939415,10.828829966329966,12.00992498983062,13.805723905723909,14.003383838383831,11.790303030303026,56.39983164983165,7.833333333333333,3.067170437140726,0.7278513427336185,0.4290868672076227,0.0909433231926629,0.836406485600905,0.8311557352542878,4.895622895622895,4.0,2.6103680286499213,24.75,24.5,12.035537655903315,1.4208754208754208,1.0,0.702066627989543,297,137,0.4612794612794613,1489,12,5.6.1.1,Paid,Chapter 5 - Earnings
233,233,"According to normal usage and by law, the term payable means justly due and legally enforceable. A sum of money is said to be payable when an individual is under an obligation to pay it. This obligation to pay can be immediately due or due at some time in the future.Earnings are payable when the claimant is in a lawful position to enforce payment (FCA A-71-95, CUB 26456; CUB 28075). Earnings are only considered payable for EI purposes when the obligation to pay is immediate, and not when the obligation to pay is some time in the future. That is, when the claimant can access them, or when the right to receive the earnings is immediate. Any other approach may cause hardship to the claimant, as earnings that the employer has not yet paid, or may not pay for some time, would be allocated.The fact that employees have acquired the right to some moneys does not mean they are immediately due. The obligation for the employer to pay these moneys may only become due at some time in the future, and the person is only able to enforce payment at that time. For example, vacation pay is not immediately due after each hour of work. It is usually due at some time in the future, such as during a vacation period, at an anniversary date, or at an entitlement date when the employee may then request the payment, according to the provisions of the contract of employment.When employees are entitled to moneys on termination, they may have the right to choose the method or time of payment. That is, one cheque at the time of separation, one cheque in the calendar year following separation, or several cheques over a period that may extend over several years. The choice of the method or time of payment governs the moment when the employer is obligated to pay and the claimant is in a position to enforce payment. Only at that time are the earnings considered payable.In addition, an amount is not considered payable when the amount and condition of payment are in dispute and the cheque is refused or returned. In that case, the amount is not immediately due but rather is payable sometime in the future when the agreement between the parties is reached, as it is only then that the person is in a position to enforce payment. Likewise, an amount is not considered payable when the employer has filed for bankruptcy or is experiencing financial difficulties, and it is not expected that payment will be issued in the immediate future (Digest 4.5.3). If the payment is made at a later date by the employer, trustee, or from a governmental Wage Earner Protection Fund, it must be allocated according to the type of earnings and the reason for the payment.When the entitlement date and the employer's obligation to pay coincide, the moneys are payable on that date. In the case of vacation pay that is paid on an anniversary date, the entitlement date (i.e. the date when the employee can access the vacation pay) and the employer's obligation to pay, occur on the same date. The vacation pay is therefore payable on that anniversary date. However, where there is first an entitlement date plus an additional condition, such as the requirement for employees to request the payment of vacation pay, earnings are not payable until the additional condition is met. The employee is not in a lawful position to enforce payment until they make a request for the vacation pay. The same would be true where an employer requires employees to return to work before becoming entitled to payment (CUB 35199).",57.9698891410049,11.30489205834684,13.089613480739835,14.799066450567262,12.375996758508911,9.798962722852512,49.639481361426256,6.16,3.136087474623765,1.0116498632322195,0.458500903917313,0.0640702707007762,0.8717015460133553,0.8777140689932782,4.5575364667747165,4.0,2.577237177186225,24.68,21.0,9.281034425105856,1.4635332252836304,1.0,0.8362041827698652,617,186,0.3014586709886548,2883,25,5.6.1.2,Payable,Chapter 5 - Earnings
234,234,"EIR 36 is divided into subsections that set out the manner of allocating different types of earnings under various situations.Because EIR 36(9) is based solely on the reason for the payment, rather than the type of earnings involved, all earnings must be examined to determine the reason for their payment. If it is determined that earnings are paid or payable by reason of a lay-off or separation, they must be allocated from the week of lay-off or separation, regardless of the nature of the earnings or the period in respect of which they are purported to be paid or payable (Digest 5.6.2.1).If the earnings were not paid by reason of a lay-off or separation, choosing the appropriate period of allocation is based on the type of earnings, if those earnings are specifically mentioned in another subsection of the regulation. When a specific type of earnings has not been mentioned in EIR 36, it is allocated pursuant to EIR 36(19).Occasionally, the name given to a payment does not match the terminology used in EIR 36. However, the name of the payment does not change the nature of the payment. For instance, what may be called a bonus may in fact represent wages, that is:earnings paid under a contract of employment for the performance of services (EIR 36(4); Digest 5.14.1, Digest 5.14.4)a payment made by reason of a lay-off or separation (EIR 36(9); Digest 5.14.5, Digest 5.14.6), ora bonus for a special event (EIR 36(19)(b); Digest 5.14.3)The period to which these earnings will be allocated depends on the true nature of the earnings (Digest 5.2.0).Once the period of allocation is determined, it must be reviewed to see if there are any other earnings already allocated to that period. In addition, when more than one type of earnings is paid or payable at the same time, the method of allocation for each type must be reviewed; they may be allocated concurrently, or consecutively, depending on the wording of the subsections involved.",40.34497754491021,18.003877245508978,15.414825405933506,21.1311377245509,21.697634730538923,11.271377245508983,67.49850299401197,10.75,3.3991437761920817,1.1630217754892311,0.4949229669069295,0.0600279141764541,0.9168593202318464,0.9099858701229095,4.724550898203593,4.0,2.8340628474783824,41.75,33.0,24.868403648002825,1.467065868263473,1.0,0.7913032616821423,334,134,0.4011976047904191,1623,8,5.6.2,Choosing the appropriate period of allocation,Chapter 5 - Earnings
235,235,"Any earnings that are paid by reason of a lay-off or separation, to meet all the employer's obligations with respect to the lay-off or separation, must be allocated from the week of lay-off or separation, regardless of their nature. This includes any earnings paid to compensate for loss of employment, as well as any payment of outstanding entitlement to unused benefits (e.g. vacation pay; accumulated sick leave credits) paid out on separation under the terms of the contract of employment. This allocation must begin from the week of lay-off or separation, regardless of the period for which the earnings are purported to be paid or payable (EIR 36(9), Digest 5.12.0).Earnings paid at the time of a lay-off or separation are usually considered to be paid for that reason. However, there may be evidence that the payment simply coincides with the date of lay-off. The true reason for the payment may be something entirely different. For instance, a lay-off may coincide with an anniversary payment of vacation pay. If the vacation pay would have been paid at that time, regardless of the lay-off, then it cannot be said that the payment was made by reason of the lay-off. Payments may be merely bookkeeping activities prompted by the lay-off or separation and not truly paid to compensate for that lay-off or separation. For instance, at the time of layoff, the employer may discover that certain earnings should have been paid at an earlier date, but were overlooked. While payment was prompted by the lay-off, it was not the reason for the payment.EIR 36(9) regarding earnings by reason of a lay-off or separation is not based on the type of earnings paid, but rather the reason for the payment. Therefore, regardless of the type of earnings involved, if earnings are paid or payable to the claimant by reason of a lay-off or separation  (i.e. to compensate for that separation event or to pay out any remaining benefits under the contract), they are allocated under that subsection. If the earnings are not paid or payable for these reasons, they are allocated according to the type of earnings.",55.61951143451144,12.572162162162162,13.518907172268552,16.033264033264032,14.352201663201662,10.064972972972974,53.32640332640332,7.076923076923077,3.2385668319276704,0.966715198188706,0.4426299925429385,0.0536716933240146,0.8865933666626612,0.8755420392209833,4.575675675675676,3.0,2.69553238039031,28.46153846153846,25.0,12.91162496247462,1.445945945945946,1.0,0.80104478890691,370,127,0.3432432432432432,1748,13,5.6.2.1,Allocation of earnings that were paid or payable by reason of a lay-off or separation,Chapter 5 - Earnings
236,236,"Once it is confirmed that the earnings were not paid or payable by reason of a lay-off or separation (e.g. not to compensate for a lay-off or separation or to pay out unused entitlement to benefits under the terms of a contract), an appropriate subsection of the regulation must be identified. EIR 36 refers to the allocation of specific types of earnings, as well as the reason for payment. If the specific type of earnings is mentioned in the regulation, earnings are allocated according to the relevant subsection (EIR 36(4) to 36(18)). If the specific type of earnings is not mentioned, earnings are allocated pursuant to EIR 36(19); the section used when none of the other subsections apply. Wages or salary for the performance of services are always allocated to the period where services were performed (EIR 36(4); Digest 5.7.1).Although there are a number of types of earnings that are payable under a contract of employment without the performance of services, if a type of earnings has been specifically mentioned elsewhere in the regulation, allocation is under that subsection rather than the more general one. When a payment is made under a contract of employment without the performance of services, these earnings are allocated to the period for which they are payable (EIR 36(5); Digest 5.7.2).When a payment is made in consideration of a claimant's returning to work or commencing work with an employer, these earnings are allocated to the period for which they are payable (EIR 36(5); Digest 5.7.0). These earnings are not payable until the claimant meets the condition of returning to work or commencing work with that employer. As such, the earnings are allocated to the week in which the claimant meets the condition.Earnings from participation in an employer's profits (profit sharing), on the basis of a commission, or through self-employment are other types of earnings that are specifically mentioned (EIR 36(6), EIR 36(6.1), EIR 36(6.2); Digest 5.15.0, Digest 5.8.0, Digest 5.16.0). Earnings that fall into these categories and arise from the performance of services are allocated to the week or weeks in which the services were performed.Where the earnings arise from a transaction, including farming transactions, the earnings are allocated as follows:if the amount of the transaction occurring in a week is greater than the maximum yearly insurable earnings divided by 52, the earnings are allocated to the week or weeks when the work that gave rise to the transaction was performed, in a manner that is proportional to the amount of work that was performed during each of those weeks. If no work was performed, then the earnings arising from the transaction are allocated to the week of the transaction onlyif the amount of the transaction occurring in a week is less than or equal to the maximum yearly insurable earnings divided by 52, the earnings are allocated to the week the transaction occurred, unless the claimant indicates that the work was performed in more than one week. If that is the case, the earnings are allocated to the weeks when the work that gave rise to the transaction was performed, in a manner that is proportional to the amount of work that was performed during each of those weeksEarnings arising from self-employment in farming, received in the form of a subsidy, are allocated to the week in which the subsidy is paid (EIR 36(7)).Earnings received following the settlement of a wrongful dismissal complaint are generally not allocated based on their nature or type. They are allocated as earnings paid by reason of lay-off or separation, that is, based on the reason for their payment (EIR 36(9); Digest 5.6.2.1, Digest 5.12.11). However, where there is a finding or admission of discipline against the employee and the earnings are awarded to specific weeks under the settlement, these earnings are handled in a different manner. The allocation starts from the first week for which the earnings are awarded, based on normal weekly earnings. However, no earnings are allocated to any weeks during a period of suspension without pay (EIR 36(11)).The following payments are allocated to the period for which they are paid or payable (EIR 36(12)):payments for sick, maternity and parental leave (EIR 36(12)(a))sickness or disability payments made under a group wage-loss indemnity plan (EIR 36(12)(b); Digest 5.11.2)provincial motor-vehicle accident insurance payments where EI is not taken into account (EIR 35(2)(d); EIR 36(12)(c); Digest 5.11.4)payments made by provincial governments for the withdrawal of services as a preventative measure (EIR 35(2)(e); EIR 36(12)(c); Digest 5.11.5), andworkers' compensation payments, other than lump sum or pension paid in full or final settlement of a claim for workers' compensation payments (EIR 36(12)(d); Digest 5.11.3)Holiday pay for a day of leave that is a designated day recognized by law, custom, or agreement is always allocated to the week in which that day occurs (EIR 36(13)).Pension earnings paid periodically, or in a lump sum, are allocated to the period for which they are payable (EIR 36(14); EIR 36(15); Digest 5.13.5). When the payment is made in a lump sum, it must first be converted to a weekly amount ((EIR 36(17); Digest 5.13.6).Earnings that are payable to a claimant under a government program intended to encourage re-employment and that are payable to the claimant as a supplement to earnings arising from a contract of employment, are allocated to the period for which they are payable (EIR 36(18)).",33.139713553796,20.45693991616209,17.66428926062214,24.474056823474616,25.789639613414074,12.828274336283188,76.5612482533768,13.789473684210526,3.8001072636160185,1.1330663903532132,0.4945715738725246,0.0650057645622167,0.8838310109244453,0.8847532552831313,4.974557522123894,4.0,2.975269531742328,47.578947368421055,32.0,36.7442308962254,1.4823008849557522,1.0,0.7924678702619097,904,258,0.2853982300884956,4637,19,5.6.2.2,Allocation based on the type of earnings,Chapter 5 - Earnings
237,237,"EIR 36(19) provides for the allocation of earnings when no other subsection applies. The period of allocation depends on whether the earnings arise from the performance of services, or if they arise from a transaction. In cases where earnings are not specifically mentioned in EIR 36(1) to 36(18); if they arise from the performance of services, they are allocated to the period in which the services were performed; if they arise from a transaction, they are allocated to the week in which the transaction occurred.An example of such a circumstance is a gratuitous payment from an employer, such as a monetary bonus or a gift at Christmas. This payment is neither paid by reason of a lay-off or separation, nor is it paid for work performed. This type of earnings, a gratuitous payment, is not specifically mentioned in any other subsection. The value of the bonus or gift is allocated to the week in which the transaction occurred, that is, to the week in which Christmas occurs (Digest 5.14.3).",58.85052631578949,11.119598997493735,13.02386679866686,14.683709273182956,12.957092731829569,10.669005847953212,50.74436090225564,6.428571428571429,3.019966764737932,0.4395876425718263,0.4784615854524321,0.0490162177519692,0.8572241365909576,0.8236443281173706,4.707602339181286,4.0,2.9073209839737646,24.428571428571427,22.0,11.424999441789833,1.456140350877193,1.0,0.7814406123270207,171,74,0.4327485380116959,829,7,5.6.2.3,Other cases where EIR 36(1) to 36(18) do not apply,Chapter 5 - Earnings
238,238,"Earnings may require allocation according to the claimant's normal weekly earnings from that employment (EIR 36(8) to 36(11); Digest 5.6.3.1). Normal weekly earnings are the ordinary, usual earnings that a claimant earns on a regular basis at that employment (CUB 65565; FCA A-841-96, CUB 35026).Generally, normal weekly earnings consist of the most recent gross weekly salary upon which the employer and the claimant have agreed (CUB 35855). Where the employee is paid an hourly rate, normal weekly earnings are calculated by multiplying the number of hours normally worked by the hourly rate of pay. The gross weekly salary agreed upon may also include compensation in addition to basic wages, such as commissions paid at regular intervals, vacation pay and holiday pay paid with each pay, northern allowance, car allowance and regular shift premiums.Fringe benefits that the claimant enjoys during employment are not included in the normal weekly earnings (CUB 65565). Such fringe benefits, which are not included in normal weekly earnings, may include life insurance benefits, long-term service awards, vacation pay that is not paid periodically, and an annual incentive allowance (FCA A-841-96, CUB 35026). However, fringe benefits may be included in normal weekly earnings when allocating earnings on separation if the calculation of the amount of compensation paid by the employer is clearly based on the fringe benefits as well as the wages (Digest 5.12.10; CUB 24992).Overtime, shift premiums, incentive or cost-of-living bonuses, irregular commissions, or other similar moneys, may occasionally increase the claimant's weekly salary. As well, the weekly salary may be reduced when the claimant works fewer hours than agreed, or temporarily works shifts for which a premium is not paid. When this increased or decreased weekly salary occurs so often that it is considered normal, it becomes the claimant's normal weekly earnings (CUB 63865). Normal may be considered as what has repeatedly occurred in 85 per cent of the weeks used to calculate the benefit rate. If this increased or reduced weekly salary varies from week to week, normal weekly earnings become the average of the increased or reduced weekly salary of the weeks under study.The gross weekly salary may vary because of the pattern of work. For example, the pattern of work may require a different number of hours to be worked in each week or a different shift premium may be applicable in each week. In addition, the work pattern may include alternating weeks on and off work, or, a person may work additional hours in a week in order to earn days off. In these cases, normal weekly earnings are determined by averaging the gross weekly salary over the weeks of the work pattern.Where there is a contract, which specifies a time period and a specific sum paid for the total period rather than an hourly or weekly wage, normal weekly earnings are determined by dividing the amount over the number of weeks of the contract period. In these situations, the actual number of hours worked in any given week is not relevant for determining normal weekly earnings.Claimants' declarations as to their weekly earnings are accepted at face value unless these amounts do not appear reasonable, or there is clear evidence to the contrary.As long as the amount reported as normal weekly earnings by the claimant on the application for benefits, is within 10% or $75 of the average weekly insurable earnings calculated from the ROE (excluding moneys paid on termination), the claimant's statement will be accepted. If the difference is greater than 10% of the amount reported by the claimant, or $75, further fact finding may be required. However, in some cases, a difference of more than 10% or $75 could still be accepted based on the claimant's circumstances or local labour market knowledge.",52.9071128608924,13.3918335208099,14.138980108339055,17.008623922009747,16.95718935133108,12.269228346456693,55.59242594675665,7.666666666666667,3.2297068250384164,0.9148919645729844,0.4706821263253533,0.053946810932509,0.8776358872652054,0.8536452556911268,4.94015748031496,5.0,2.612425181613946,30.23809523809524,27.0,11.843844139084643,1.4566929133858268,1.0,0.7751647578165582,635,232,0.3653543307086614,3235,21,5.6.3,Normal weekly earnings from that employment,Chapter 5 - Earnings
239,239,"The total earnings from a specific employer  are allocated at the claimant's normal weekly earnings from that employment, to each consecutive week except the last, beginning with the week of lay off or separation from that employment  (EIR 36(8)(a) & (b); EIR 36(9); EIR 36(10)).Only earnings arising from that employment are to be considered when allocating at normal weekly earnings. Which employment is meant by the phrase that employment must be examined in the context of the wording of the regulation in which it appears.In the case of allocation of earnings paid or payable by reason of a lay-off or separation from an employment, the term that employment refers to the employment that is lost for that reason, and that gives rise to the earnings (EIR 36(9)). This means that all earnings paid or payable by reason of a lay-off or separation are allocated to each week so that the total earnings in that week from the employment which has been lost, do not exceed the normal weekly earnings from that same employment. Earnings from a different employer are not considered as earnings from that employment.As long as a lay-off or separation from the employment giving rise to the earnings legitimately occurs, or the right to the payment legitimately occurs under a contractual provision, earnings from any subsequent employment with the same employer are not used in determining the normal weekly earnings to be used for allocation purposes. Termination moneys paid or payable before a claimant actually ceases work with an employer must be carefully examined to determine exactly what is giving rise to the payment and why they are paid or payable at that time.When a trustee is appointed to continue the operations of an employer in bankruptcy, it is considered to be subsequent employment and not that employment. As a result, earnings for work performed for the trustee are not taken into account when allocating any earnings paid or payable by reason of a lay-off or separation, by the trustee or a Wage Protection Fund, on behalf of the bankrupt employer (FCA A-397-08, CUB 70719).In the case of an allocation of vacation pay that is paid or payable to a claimant by reasons other than a lay-off or separation from an employment, the term that employment refers to the employment that triggered the payment of the vacation pay.In the case of earnings awarded to specific weeks after a finding or admission of discipline, that employment referred to is the one from which the claimant was suspended (EIR 36(11)).If an allocation is required at the rate of normal weekly earnings, the allocation period must be reviewed to see if there are any other earnings applicable to that same period, from the same employment that triggered the earnings being allocated. Any earnings from employment other than the employment that gave rise to the amount being allocated, are not considered when determining the amount to be allocated to each week as normal weekly earnings.",37.472857142857166,18.4665873015873,17.02489783603662,22.43492063492064,22.31630952380952,11.891904761904758,69.77777777777777,11.666666666666666,3.332173901363646,0.9511638669838736,0.4756946821839247,0.0322802457710677,0.9128604151985862,0.9003029227256775,4.829365079365079,4.0,2.807771738685025,42.0,44.0,15.663120165960974,1.498015873015873,1.0,0.8404434957742949,504,153,0.3035714285714285,2481,12,5.6.3.1,That employment,Chapter 5 - Earnings

If no work was performed, then the earnings arising from the transaction are allocated to the week of the transaction onlyIf the earnings are less than or equal to the maximum yearly insurable earnings divided by 52, they are allocated to the week the transaction occurred, unless the claimant demonstrates that the work was performed in more than one week.

241,241,"Persons who engage in work under an employer-employee relationship are employed under a contract of service, also referred to as a contract of employment. A contract of service may be express or implied. Under an express contract, an employer and employee enter into an actual written or verbal agreement regarding the terms of employment. On the other hand, an implied contract is one that is  presumed, based on the act or conduct of the parties. An implied contract may arise where one party, without being requested to do so, renders services under circumstances indicating that they expect to be paid for those services, and the other party, knowing the circumstances, accepts the benefit of those services.An express contract of service may be in the form of:a formal written contract complete with personnel policy manualsa simple written agreementa verbal agreement between an employee and an employer, orit may contain both written and verbal elementsHowever, whatever form the contract takes, the terms and conditions of the employment arrangement are set out and known by the parties involved. In addition, the labour laws of the jurisdiction where the claimant is employed may also dictate terms and conditions regarding the employment and payments to which an employee is entitled during employment, and upon loss of that employment.Although, it is the entire income arising out of a contract of employment that is determined to be earnings for benefit purposes, there are some types of income which arise out of a contract of employment which have been specifically excluded as earnings (EIR 35(2); EIR 35(7), Digest 5.5.0). Certain types of earnings arising out of a contract of employment require specific allocation methods. Therefore, it is important to identify for what the claimant is being compensated. The terms and conditions of the contract of employment, or the collective agreement, are essential in making this determination.Under a contract of employment, claimants may be compensated for the performance of services or may receive compensation without being required to directly perform services  (Digest 5.7.1; Digest 5.7.2). Where the specific compensation is not directly for the performance of services, the right to the compensation may arise from services that the claimant has performed in the past or through agreeing to be available for work with that employer. The period to which earnings payable under a contract of employment are allocated depends on the type of earnings.",47.00194029850746,13.836929637526657,14.244340213328725,16.759346126510305,17.238710021321964,13.519900497512438,64.78393745557925,10.357142857142858,3.3028959073210324,1.403315313378758,0.493451942115156,0.0879567922288339,0.8616312604684097,0.8735115826129913,5.161691542288557,5.0,2.913551306959717,28.714285714285715,23.5,14.518109732471428,1.544776119402985,1.0,0.778591070045817,402,161,0.4004975124378109,2119,14,5.7.0,Remuneration under a contract of employment,Chapter 5 - Earnings
242,242,"Earnings payable under a contract of employment for the performance of services, are allocated to the period in which the services were performed (EIR 36(4)). Remuneration under a contract of employment for the performance of services is part of the entire income arising out of any employment (EIR 35(2); Digest 5.3.0). It includes those moneys that are paid for the services that an employee provides to an employer, such as:wages (usually on an hourly, daily or piecework basis), or salary (fixed payment at regular intervals)fringe benefits (Digest 5.3.2.2)shift bonuses and shift premiums (Digest 5.14.2)overtime (Digest 5.7.2.3)stand-by hourscommissionsisolation pay or northern allowancescall-back payproduction bonuses (Digest 5.14.1), or end-of-season bonuses (Digest 5.14.4)tips or gratuities based on a service charge or flat rate (Digest 5.14.7), orprofit-sharing plans (Digest 5.15.0)However, retroactive increases in wages or salary are specifically excluded from consideration as earnings (Digest 5.5.3).It is not necessary that earnings are actually paid before an allocation can be made; it is sufficient that they are payable (Digest 5.6.1.2). However, due to the unique nature of commission payments, commissions are allocated to the week in which the services giving rise to those earnings are performed, or to the week in which the transaction giving rise to the earnings occurred (EIR 36(6); Digest 5.8.0).If the employer's pay period does not coincide with the calendar week (Sunday to Saturday), then the earnings are allocated as a fraction of the pay period, based on the number of days for which the claimant is remunerated in the week (EIR 36(2)). If paid by the hour, earnings are allocated according to the number of hours worked in each calendar week.Shifts that start on Saturday and end on Sunday overlap 2 EI calendar weeks. As wages are allocated to the period for which services are performed, they are allocated to 2 different weeks based on the hours worked in each week.It is the terms of the contract of employment that determines whether remuneration is payable specifically for the performance of services, for periods in which no services are performed, or for both.Workers may be under an annual contract of employment that covers periods in which services must be performed, as well as periods in which services are not performed. If the annual contract provides that the workers are only paid for the period in which they perform services, then earnings payable under these contracts of employment are allocated only to the period in which services are performed. They are, not allocated to any period not worked and not compensated by the employer. This is true even if the claimant receives their remuneration in installments over the working and non-working periods.It is not the frequency, method or timing of the payments that is critical in determining whether the payments are for the performance of services; rather it is the reason the claimant is paid.Wages are generally paid for the number of hours or days an employee works, or for the number of units an employee produces; that is, for the services which are actually performed. Wages are allocated to the period in which the work was performed (EIR 36(4)).Employees who receive a salary generally have entered into an agreement to be paid for a specific period, regardless of the number of hours they are required to work in that period. Salary payable under the terms of a contract of employment for the period of the contract is earnings for the entire period covered by the contract, even if this period includes weeks during which no services are performed. These earnings are generally spread equally over each week of the contractual period, despite the fact that the volume of work performed may vary from week to week.Payments made to employees who are required to be available on standby during off-duty hours may be equated to wages or salary paid for services rendered. These earnings are allocated to the period that the standby services occur. In the same way, call back pay is the wage or salary payable for being called back to work, and usually represents payment for a minimum set number of hours, regardless of the number of hours actually worked. Call back pay is essentially payable for the hours worked and therefore, is allocated to those hours.",48.54250000000005,15.006150793650791,13.99691118717104,17.936507936507937,19.125482142857145,12.565166666666665,61.92460317460318,9.476190476190476,3.3276451701270866,1.0637533583352694,0.4871689639589583,0.0418793465889546,0.8765691071748734,0.8481646117411161,4.970833333333333,4.0,2.875757750383173,34.285714285714285,28.0,24.40558651336256,1.459722222222222,1.0,0.7645186797772799,720,223,0.3097222222222222,3673,21,5.7.1,Remuneration under a contract of employment for the performance of services,Chapter 5 - Earnings
243,243,"The entire income arising out of any employment is earnings for benefit purposes. This includes remuneration payable under a contract of employment. In order to be considered to arise out of employment, the payment must display the character of compensation given in return for work done by the recipient. That is, it must arise out of the employment itself, and not merely as a consequence of the employment status of the recipient (FCA A-597-94, CUB 25472).Remuneration payable under a contract of employment without requiring that an employee directly perform services in exchange for that particular payment is considered compensation for work, if the entitlement to the payment arises because of the terms and conditions of the employment contract. The entitlement to the payment must be linked to services that were performed in the past; such as pay for leave, separation payments, or the claimant remaining available for work with that employer.Earnings payable under a contract of employment without the performance of services are allocated to the period for which they are payable (EIR 36(5)). In addition, earnings which are payable in consideration of a claimant's returning to or commencing work with an employer, are allocated to the period for which they are payable (i.e. when the claimant fulfills all the required conditions and returns to or commences work). If the employee must return to work for a specific period of time before being entitled to the payment for returning to work, then the period for which it is payable is that period.All earnings payable under a contract of employment which are not directly for the performance of services, are considered payable without the performance of services and are allocated as such. Although the following types of earnings are payable under a contract of employment without the performance of services, these types of payments have specific allocation rules, and are discussed in other sections of this chapter:moneys arising from a pension fund (EIR 36(14) and (15); Digest 5.13.0)moneys paid or payable by reason of a lay-off or separation (EIR 36(9); Digest 5.12.0)vacation leave and pay (EIR 36(8); Digest 5.10.0), andsick leave (EIR 36(12)(a); Digest 5.11.1)Included in earnings payable under a contract of employment without the performance of services, which are allocated, are:Supplement Unemployment Benefits (SUB) Plan payments which do not meet specified criteria (Digest 5.7.2.4)damages for the breach of a hiring contract or recall rights, and periods of leave compensated by an employer, such as compensatory leave for overtime worked (EIR 36(5); Digest 5.7.2.3)leave funded through regularly working more hours than the normal work week (Digest 5.7.2.5) or, funded through the setting aside of a portion of the employee's salary when working, to receive remuneration during periods of leave (Digest 5.7.2.6), andpre-retirement leave (EIR 36(5); Digest 5.12.7)These earnings are allocated to the period for which they are payable.Other earnings that are payable under a contract of employment without the performance of services and that have specific methods of allocation are:designated holidays (EIR 36(13); Digest 5.7.2.1)maternity leave, adoption leave, or leave for the care of a child or an ill family member (EIR 36(12)(a); Digest 5.7.2.2), andpayments in consideration of a claimant's returning to or commencing work with an employer (EIR 36(5))",32.43651063222492,19.03528756957329,16.850672712058472,22.15047809333524,23.943069787355505,14.249721706864564,75.22777222777222,14.0,3.667824531623784,1.5776041868626625,0.5579324612819575,0.0749217287574834,0.904875914255778,0.8908456726507707,5.231910946196661,4.0,3.032297123857916,41.46153846153846,34.0,20.73872403394705,1.5640074211502784,1.0,0.8490327837300816,539,189,0.3506493506493506,2911,13,5.7.2,Remuneration under a contract of employment without the performance of services,Chapter 5 - Earnings
244,244,"Payment received for designated holidays are part of the entire income that arises out of any employment (EIR 35(2)). Payments for designated holidays include those holidays or non-working days that are observed by law, custom or agreement. Designated holidays may also include any holiday or non-working day that immediately precedes or follows a holiday or non-working day. Payments received for designated holidays are allocated to the week in which the designated day occurs (EIR 36(13)).Holidays or non-working days observed by law include those statutory and civic holidays designated by a provincial or federal authority. Holidays or non-working days may also be designated by custom or agreement by a particular employer or industry. These designated days may be instead of, or in addition to, the required statutory and civic holidays.A designated holiday may fall prior to, or after a lay-off or separation, during a vacation period, or the payment may be conditional upon the claimant's return to work. Nevertheless, the allocation is to the week in which the designated holiday falls, even if the employer has agreed to delay the payment for the holiday to a time agreeable to the employer and the employee, or the employee's union (CUB 60006; FCA A-148-88, CUB 14671).If the employer and the union agree to substitute a different day to observe a designated holiday, then any earnings paid for that holiday are allocated to the week in which the substituted holiday occurs because that is when, by custom or agreement, the holiday is taken. However, if there is evidence that the change was made solely to circumvent the intent of the EI legislation, such as when the day chosen is a day when no work is normally done, the earnings would be allocated to the week in which the original designated holiday occurs (EIR 36(13)).In some industries, rather than giving a specific amount for each designated holiday, the designated holiday pay may be a percentage of wages paid, which is to apply to any designated holiday for which entitlement is shown. In order to be entitled to payment for a specified holiday, the employee is usually required to have worked the day before and the day after the holiday. The practical effect of this requirement ensures that the designated holidays being compensated occurred while being employed. Designated holiday pay paid as a percentage is allocated to the weeks in which the holidays occurred during the period of employment.A retroactive allocation may be required if the claimant was in receipt of benefits during any of the statutory or designated holidays. If there are a number of holidays, an approximate percentage will be calculated according to the number of designated holidays (CUB 67705).If a claimant works on a designated holiday, the earnings received for the designated holiday are allocated to that day, in addition to their regular wages (EIR 36(4)). However, if the claimant banks the extra time worked on the holiday, to be taken or paid out at a later date, or if there is an agreement between the union and the employer to substitute a different day, the earnings would be allocated to the week in which the leave or the alternate day was taken (EIR 36(13)).",37.775947011706734,16.9503068391867,18.31540922903916,22.264004929143564,19.517788046826865,11.985878003696858,66.93542821934689,11.133333333333333,3.405593082973961,1.0655160878586256,0.4418652523439256,0.0654082191746062,0.8976460567542485,0.9026244557820834,4.865064695009242,4.0,2.815047276613106,36.06666666666667,22.0,24.26098834663492,1.5656192236598891,1.0,0.8478749314442967,541,179,0.3308687615526802,2699,15,5.7.2.1,Designated holidays,Chapter 5 - Earnings
245,245,"When a claimant receives, or is entitled to receive, wages or salary under a leave plan for maternity, adoption, or care of a child or ill family member, these moneys are earnings arising out of employment. It is not necessary that such moneys actually be paid. It is sufficient that they could be paid at the claimant's request. The leave payments are allocated to the weeks for which they are paid or payable (EIR 35(2)(c); EIR 36(12)).If they meet specific criteria, leave payments for maternity, adoption, or care of a child or ill family member are specifically excluded from consideration as earnings. They are not earnings if the payment:when combined with the claimant's weekly rate of EI benefits, does not exceed the claimant's normal weekly earnings from employment, anddoes not reduce the claimant's accumulated sick leave, vacation leave, severance pay or any other accumulated credits from employment (EIR 38; Digest 5.5.2.2)When there is dual employment, only that portion of the benefit rate and the normal weekly earnings from the employer that pays the top-up are to be considered.       Maternity, adoption or care of a child or ill family member payments that do not meet the criteria to be specifically excluded as earnings, are considered earnings for benefit purposes, but not during the waiting period (EIR 39(3)).Payments received as encouragement to return to work following maternity leave or leave to care for a child or ill family member, are also earnings. When the payment is in consideration of the claimant's return to work for a specific period, the earnings are allocated to the required specific period which follows the claimant's return to work, and not to the period of leave (EIR 36(5)). A person may return to work following a period of leave for maternity, adoption or the care of a child or family member, and only then receive compensation intended to cover the waiting period. In this case, the leave pay is allocated to the one-week EI waiting period where these moneys are not taken into account as earnings (EIR 36(12)(a); EIR 39(3)(b)).",44.092465577969904,16.6875888568684,15.322241378113624,20.14844700608389,20.691956452129368,11.951123919308358,65.06852385526737,10.22222222222222,3.732206056466195,0.8518303152907492,0.4595316339927228,0.0657810198737758,0.8527028635144234,0.852053531578609,4.85014409221902,4.0,2.683178194640491,38.55555555555556,36.0,20.71022887963611,1.4610951008645534,1.0,0.7671662438551822,347,129,0.3717579250720461,1737,9,5.7.2.2,Maternity adoption or care of a child / ill family member leave,Chapter 5 - Earnings
246,246,"A contract of employment sets out the number of hours and days that employees are normally expected to work. The contract also sets out the remuneration to which an employee is entitled if they are required to work hours in excess of, or outside of, the regular hours set out in the contract.Employees may have the right, under their contract of employment, to choose how they are compensated for overtime worked. Compensation for overtime worked is not an earned benefit in addition to wages for work, as in the case of accumulated sick leave or vacation pay; it is the actual wages for the work. The worker may have the choice to be compensated in pay, or to receive the equivalent of the overtime worked as a period of leave with pay (compensatory leave). This compensatory leave may be accumulated until the employee is in a position to take the leave and the employer is in a position to allow it.By choosing to accumulate the overtime hours worked to be used as paid leave at a later date, the employee and the employer have an agreement that the employee will be allowed to take leave and receive remuneration for the period of the leave, rather than receive payment when the overtime is worked. For any hour accumulated in this manner, under the contract of employment, earnings are no longer strictly payable for services performed during the period worked. Earnings under that contract of employment are now payable when regular hours are worked, and for a period of leave where services are not required. The overtime hours that are paid during an agreed period of leave are allocated to the period for which they are payable (i.e. to the period of leave granted) (EIR 36(5)). In these cases, the hours being accumulated are no longer allocated as earnings for the week in which the overtime hours were worked.Claimants may be unable to take their accumulated compensatory leave due to the expiry of a set time limit, or due to a lay-off or separation. In these situations, the employer is still under a contractual obligation to pay for the overtime worked, or to grant time off with pay. If the employer can no longer grant time off with pay, the employer must still pay the claimant for the overtime worked. When this payment is made, no matter whether the payment was prompted by lay-off, separation or due to an anniversary date, it is earnings payable under a contract of employment for the performance of services, and is allocated to the period in which the services were performed (i.e. when the overtime was worked) (EIR 36(4)).",56.04086904761908,12.862464285714283,13.133204557630332,16.053809523809527,15.129382440476183,10.207053571428569,52.18809523809525,6.666666666666667,3.5121667414652484,0.7111430242939186,0.4727767627419368,0.0596801457499186,0.8870187103748322,0.8804621054575994,4.591517857142857,4.0,2.5913005938212312,29.866666666666667,27.0,10.63871337250056,1.4241071428571428,1.0,0.7981838241231382,448,138,0.3080357142857143,2107,15,5.7.2.3,Compensatory leave for overtime worked,Chapter 5 - Earnings
247,247,"Employers may supplement their employees' EI benefits during periods of unemployment due to a temporary stoppage of work, training, illness, injury, quarantine, maternity, care of a child leave, or leave to provide care or support to an ill family member. These supplemental payments make up most of the difference between the claimant's EI benefits and the employee's normal wages while employed.As these payments are moneys arising out of employment, they would normally be earnings to be deducted from EI benefits (EIR 35(2)). However, payments made by an employer to supplement EI benefits are excluded from consideration as earnings if they are made under a Supplementary Unemployment Benefit (SUB) plan which meets specific conditions (EIR 37(2)).SUB plans are reviewed at the national level to determine if all required conditions are met, and a list of the SUB plans that meet the conditions is maintained. Any payment made under a SUB plan that does not meet all of the conditions, is treated as earnings and is allocated to the period for which it is payable (that is, the period of unemployment) (EIR 35(2)).Certain supplements to EI benefits have the same effect on entitlement to those benefits, even if they are paid for other reasons and through a plan other than a formal approved SUB plan. For example, supplemental payments made by an employer or another person to supplement EI benefits during maternity, adoption, leave to care for a child, or leave for the care or support of a family member, are specifically excluded from consideration as earnings, if they meet specific criteria. These payments are not earnings if the payment, when combined with the claimants' weekly rate of EI benefits, does not exceed their normal weekly earnings from employment, and does not reduce the employee's accumulated sick leave, vacation leave, severance pay or any other accumulated credits from employment (EIR 38; Digest 5.5.2.2).",29.000769230769265,20.28708791208792,18.99602597827317,24.751648351648356,24.677445054945053,13.275128205128205,75.66117216117216,13.857142857142858,4.346467277072644,1.0547901644017332,0.4815369352746653,0.0466146360082558,0.8954864243666331,0.8873356819152832,5.057692307692308,4.0,2.893937927087978,44.57142857142857,47.0,17.111876768216053,1.5673076923076923,1.0,0.8781290908501088,312,143,0.4583333333333333,1629,7,5.7.2.4,Supplemental unemployment benefits plan - Criteria not met,Chapter 5 - Earnings
248,248,"Contracts of employment (verbal or written) between an employer and its employees, establish the number of hours and days that employees are normally expected to work. The workweek in the contracts of employment for some employers or industries, may exceed the hours or days worked by full-time employees employed elsewhere. When the regular workweek of employees is in excess of the hours, days or shifts normally worked by individuals in full-time employment, these employment contracts often offer additional benefits to employees, to compensate for the increased regular workweeks (FCA A-427-14).There is no formal definition of full-time employment in the EI Act or regulations. What is full-time employment is a factual determination that should be based on evidence. A determination of what constitutes the normal number of hours worked by persons in full-time employment must be made, based on local labour market information and terms of the Employment Standards Act in the claimant's province or territory of employment. Under the above mentioned contracts of employment (verbal or written), employees receive their usual remuneration for the actual higher number of hours or days worked and, to compensate for working this increased regular work week, are entitled to a period of leave. This period of leave may be with or without pay. These days of leave are commonly referred to as lay days or periods of leave, and are an earned benefit in addition to wages paid for the work actually performed. This is similar to the accumulation of vacation pay.Entitlement to lay days or periods of leave may also occur when employees work a number of hours, days or shifts in a compressed fashion making these hours, days or shifts in excess of those worked by full-time employees in a week. As a result of this compressed work, these employees obtain leave or time off for periods they would otherwise be required to work. These employees may receive the same wage or salary each week regardless of the actual hours worked in each week.Due to special provisions, there is no interruption of earnings for any week or part week in which leave for a lay day or period of leave is taken, unless there was an interruption from other employment in a claimant's qualifying period (EIR 14(3); Digest 2.3.2). The claimant is also considered to have worked a full working week for any week or part week of lay days or period of leave taken (EIA 11(4); Digest 4.3.5). This is true whether, or not the claimant is paid for the lay days or period of leave.If lay days or a period of leave is taken with pay, earnings payable for this leave are allocated in the same way as any earnings payable under a contract of employment without the performance of services;  to the period for which the leave is payable. If the lay days or period of leave taken is without pay, there cannot be any allocation of earnings to the leave period. In this situation, what must be examined is whether or not the weeks covered by the lay days or period of leave are considered to be weeks of unemployment.Sometimes lay days or a period of leave cannot be taken due to a specific date being reached, a lay-off, or a separation from employment. The claimant may lose entitlement to the accumulated lay days or period of leave. If this occurs, an interruption of earnings will occur as of the date the individual stopped working, or the date they are no longer entitled to the lay days/period of leave, whichever is later. In addition, a disentitlement for working a full working week during lay days or a period of leave does not apply if there are no lay days or period of leave taken. However, if any lay days or period of leave were taken in the last week worked, those provisions may be applicable to that week, as they apply for any week or part week where lay days or a period of leave occurred.If the right to paid leave for lay days or a period of leave is lost upon reaching a specific date, a lay-off, or a separation from employment, the claimant may be entitled to moneys in lieu of that paid leave. Similar to vacation leave entitlement, the paid lay days or period of leave is a benefit accumulated under the contract, which is paid out if the leave cannot be taken. These moneys are earnings arising out of employment. If these earnings are paid or payable by reason of a lay-off or separation, these earnings are allocated in the same manner as any other earnings payable by reason of a lay-off or separation (EIR 36(9); Digest 5.12.4). However, the normal weekly earnings in that case would be based on the claimant's actual workweek. If the earnings are payable because the paid leave must be used by a specific date, the allocation would be to the week in which the money in lieu of the leave became payable under the contract (EIR 36(5)).If the right to lay days or a period of leave without pay is lost on reaching a specific date, a lay-off or a separation from employment, and the claimant is not entitled to moneys in lieu of that leave, there are no earnings to be allocated, the same as if the unpaid leave was already taken.",57.11186477644495,13.148830143270786,13.24877658267452,16.617741510923928,15.531686158011505,9.669400218102506,52.3404279321626,6.551724137931035,3.1945779570526485,0.975403816951649,0.5156266965031919,0.0744122808262608,0.8840121435267585,0.876084981141267,4.490730643402399,4.0,2.5827992410974256,31.620689655172413,30.0,17.3551419253348,1.390403489640131,1.0,0.7661283299833582,917,224,0.2442748091603053,4224,29,5.7.2.5,Lay days or periods of leave,Chapter 5 - Earnings
249,249,"Deferred salary leave or self-funded leave plans are popular options in the workplace. In these cases, employees choose to spread out their salary earned when employed, over a period of work and a period of unpaid leave, in order to be considered an employee and receive remuneration during the period of leave. For example, an employee could receive the pay from working 4 years, spread over a 5-year period. The employee is considered an employee on paid leave for the fifth year.By special provisions, employees on deferred leave do not have an interruption of earnings during their leave period, unless an interruption can be established on the basis of other employment (EIR 14(6); Digest 2.3.4). Employees on this type of leave are considered to be working full working weeks for each week of their deferred leave (EIA 11(3); Digest 4.4.4). This is not applicable if the employment terminates for some reason, and the self-funded leave agreement is broken.By choosing the deferred salary leave plan, employees consent to be paid a lesser amount as salary during their period of work, so they can be paid that same salary during the period of leave. If the issue becomes one of allocation of earnings, the earnings are allocated to the period of work and to the period of paid leave at the agreed upon salary level for that period (EIR 36(5)).",61.82730567477353,11.067181688125896,11.645159339076184,13.789031950405343,13.487706247019553,10.488240343347634,44.77300906056272,4.888888888888889,3.2286664974972883,0.8350485295523162,0.4663175688681704,0.0522239795776398,0.8440777510404587,0.7979364906038556,4.665236051502146,4.0,2.4493919820271204,25.88888888888889,25.0,9.666028075969574,1.4034334763948495,1.0,0.7118773258923718,233,107,0.4592274678111588,1121,9,5.7.2.6,Deferred salary leave,Chapter 5 - Earnings
250,250,"Commissions are a percentage or a flat rate paid based on sales made or services performed by the employee. Commissions arise out of employment under a contract of service and are earnings (EIR 35(2)). Commissions are allocated to the period in which the services that gave rise to the right to the money, are performed (EIR 36(6)).Commissions may also arise from a transaction (Digest 5.16.9.1). It is the total or aggregate amount of commission earnings arising from the transaction that determines how the payment is allocated. When the total commission earnings arising from the transaction is greater than the maximum yearly insurable earnings in effect at the time of the transaction divided by 52, then the earnings are allocated proportionally to the specific weeks where the work that resulted in the transaction was performed. If no work was performed, then the earnings are allocated to the week of the transaction (EIR 36(6.1)(a)).When the total commission earnings arising from the transaction are equal to or less than the maximum yearly insurable earnings in effect at the time of the transaction divided by 52, then the earnings are allocated to the week in which the transaction occurred (EIR 36(6.1)(b)). However, if the claimant indicates that the work that gave rise to the commission earnings (resulting from the transaction) was performed in more than one week, then the earnings are allocated to the specific weeks where the work was performed, in a manner that is proportional to the amount of work performed during each of those weeks.To determine how commissions will be allocated, it must be ascertained whether the right to the commission occurred due to services performed, or as a result of the completion of a transaction. A right to the commission occurs when claimants have a legal right to compel their employer to pay them; that is, when claimants have a legal actionable right to the moneys. Although in most situations of commission sales there are services performed, the right to the commission may arise from either those specific services, or from a specific transaction.Claimants may have an actionable right to the commission at the time of and because of the services performed. When the actionable right is because of the services performed, there is not necessarily a sale of a product, although there could be. There is an offer of services (a contract is set up between the customer and the person supplying the service), someone accepts the offer, and once the service has been performed, the commission is owed (CUB 20034, CUB 25395). The date the service is performed is usually the same as the date of the sale and it is at that time that claimants have an actionable right to the commission. Examples include hairdressers who receive a commission on their services, employees who prepare income tax returns, repairpersons who repair appliances, or piece workers. In these situations, the commissions should be allocated to the week(s) in which the services that gave rise to the commissions were performed.Claimants may have an actionable right to the commission only when the sale or contract is finalized. This right may occur at the time of the sale or later, or at the time the product is delivered, and is determined by the terms of the contract with the customer or employer. In these situations, claimants often spend a lot of time performing services without gaining any right to commissions. Examples are cosmetic or furniture salespersons, home or door-to-door sales of various products, or life insurance salespersons. If the finalizing of the sale or the contract (which gives the right to the commission) occurs at a different time from the time services are performed, the allocation of the commission earnings cannot be completed until after the transaction takes place (CUB 77097; CUB 67376). Whether a claimant is working a full working week or not, their availability for work may need to be considered for any period they are performing services without any income.Sometimes, it is a later event or some other action that gives claimants the actionable right to commissions. It is the later event and not the performance of services or the time of the claimant's sale or contract with the customer, that gives them the right to the commission. For example:real estate sales where the right to commissions is not reached until the sale closes and the property changes handscar sales where the right to commissions is not reached until the transfer of ownership has been completedpayments made based on the sales of people the claimant has recruited for the companyroyalties, which are calculated as a percentage (for example, per play of a commercial) or are calculated periodically (for example, replays of a commercial), that provide for further rights to commissionsrenewal of life insurance policies, where future anniversary dates of the renewals provide the right to subsequent commissionsIn these situations, the allocation of earnings arising from a transaction or event is determined by the total or aggregate amount of the commission arising from the transaction. If the earnings are equal to or less than the maximum yearly insurable earnings in effect at the time of the transaction, divided by 52, they are allocated to the week of the transaction. If the earnings are greater than the maximum, then the commission earnings are allocated proportionally to the weeks in which the work that gave rise to the transaction was performed. Commission earnings that cannot be attributed to either the performance of a service or a transaction are allocated equally to each week where the money was earned (EIR 36(6.2)).",50.53228678038381,14.533422174840087,15.532846611407376,19.02899786780384,18.739445628997863,12.553432835820892,62.6044776119403,9.75,3.2803078589825034,0.6641065565304398,0.475814508006499,0.0508857163013875,0.8804447363924097,0.8743428404514606,4.97228144989339,4.0,3.002358582034184,33.5,30.0,21.46009585919211,1.445628997867804,1.0,0.7766083653869397,938,249,0.26545842217484,4767,28,5.8.0,Commissions,Chapter 5 - Earnings

252,252,"Vacation pay is often the regular wages or salary received by an employee while on annual vacation leave. It may be paid on the regular payday or just before going on vacation. Vacation pay may also be calculated as a percentage of wages earned, and either set aside and paid to the employee at fixed times during the year, or paid with every regular pay.Throughout the country, legislation requires employers to pay vacation pay to employees who work under a contract of service although not all contracts allow for vacation leave or vacation time. The purpose of vacation pay is to allow employees to receive pay during periods of vacation or rest despite the fact that, in reality, not all employees who receive vacation pay are entitled to time off work.Employers are required to pay a minimum percentage of the employee's gross wages or salary, as vacation pay. A claimant or employer may refer to vacation pay as a bonus, indemnity, or gratuity. However, if the moneys received were in the nature of vacation pay as described above and under the terms of either a verbal or a written agreement, they are treated as such, regardless of what term the employer or employee may give them.",53.13826923076927,12.306730769230771,15.247664890283003,17.323076923076922,13.39903846153846,10.313076923076924,53.88461538461539,7.25,3.2063354307755203,0.6372149705718169,0.4761908372438187,0.0461599805472903,0.8879556485584804,0.8801529010136923,4.634615384615385,4.0,2.51173282320153,26.0,24.0,10.41633332799983,1.5048076923076923,1.0,0.7844498081326108,208,102,0.4903846153846153,985,8,5.10.0,Vacation pay,Chapter 5 - Earnings

An exception occurs when the vacation pay has acquired the character of savings rather than income (CUB 22732). This occurs when an employer, union or agency acts as a trustee.

254,254,"EIR 36 is divided into subsections that set out the manner of allocating different types of earnings, under various situations. One of the subsections deals strictly with payments made by reason of a lay-off or separation. This subsection must be used regardless of the nature of the earnings and the period in respect of which they are purported to be paid or payable (EIR 36(9), EIR 36(10)). Therefore, all earnings must be examined to determine whether the reason for their payment is due to a lay-off or separation.When the earnings are not paid or payable by reason of a lay-off or separation, choosing the appropriate period of allocation is based on the specific type of earnings, and the appropriate subsection in the regulations, if the earnings are specifically mentioned.  When a specific type of earnings is not mentioned, earnings are allocated pursuant to EIR 36(19).One of the types of earnings specifically mentioned in EIR 36(8) is vacation pay paid or payable for reasons other than for a lay-off or separation. When the payment is for a reason other than for a lay-off or separation, allocation depends on whether the payment is made for a specific vacation period, or for some other reason (EIR 36(8)(a) & (b)). Vacation pay is allocated weekly and is based on the claimant's normal weekly earnings (EIR 36(8), EIR 36(9), EIR 36(10); Digest 5.6.3).Vacation pay may be paid:by reason of a lay-off or separation (EIR 36(9); Digest 5.10.3)for a specific period of vacation (EIR 36(8)(a); Digest 5.10.4)on an anniversary date (EIR 36(8)(b); Digest 5.10.5)at the claimant's request (EIR 36(8)(b); Digest 5.10.5), orincluded in every pay period (EIR 36(8)(b); Digest 5.10.5)Sometimes the reason for the payment is not obvious and must be determined before allocation can occur, as the real reason for the payment may be different from the circumstances that prompted the payment. The payment of vacation pay may also coincide with another event, giving the appearance that it was made for other reasons. The real reason for the payment must be determined, as allocation is on that basis. When the payment of vacation pay coincides with the lay-off or separation, and where there is no evidence to the contrary, it is assumed that the vacation pay was paid or payable by reason of a lay-off or separation (EIR 36(9)).The determination of income for income tax purposes, and earnings for insurability purposes, have no effect on the allocation of vacation pay for EI benefit purposes.",42.37453560063645,16.023204057279237,15.4700424275458,19.31272871917264,18.645326173428792,11.587494033412884,63.317621320604616,9.916666666666666,3.4343024195699035,1.1169424471579374,0.467738695800298,0.0625425968850052,0.8768010789697821,0.8343997061252594,4.801909307875895,4.0,2.8647135051720745,34.916666666666664,26.5,20.57287183539419,1.5250596658711215,1.0,0.8580475053862983,419,142,0.3389021479713603,2087,12,5.10.2,Allocation,Chapter 5 - Earnings
255,255,"Sometimes it is necessary to examine the employer's policy, the collective agreement or the separation agreement, in order to determine the specific reason for payment. Usually, on a lay-off or separation, any unused vacation leave is converted to a monetary amount, and paid out to the employee. In these situations, the lay-off or separation has prompted the payment, and it can reasonably be assumed it is the reason for the payment. If this is the case, the vacation pay is allocated under EIR 36(9) and EIR 36(10).Occasionally, there may be an indication that the real reason for the payment is something other than the lay-off or separation. In other words, it may only be coincidental that the vacation pay is paid at the time of lay-off or separation whereas the real reason for the payment may be, an overlooked anniversary date or a scheduled vacation period. In these cases, the real reason for payment must be clarified, and once determined, it is allocated accordingly (FCA A-217-93, CUB 20723A; Digest 5.10.4)).The date a payment is actually made is not relevant. For example, vacation pay paid before an actual separation from employment so that it does not affect entitlement to EI benefits, is still deemed to be paid in respect of the separation because the reason for the payment was, for example, a plant closure (CUB 54211). In these cases the fact that the vacation pay was paid earlier, in contemplation of the lay-off or separation, does not change the fact that it is the lay-off or separation that is the true reason for the payment. This principle applies even if the Commission erroneously advised a claimant that payment of vacation pay before separation would not affect the payment of EI benefits (CUB 56521).With the exception of trust funds, it does not matter when the vacation pay was earned. Rather, what is relevant is what caused it to be immediately payable (Digest 5.10.6). If the lay-off or separation was the reason for payment, then it must be allocated from the week of the lay-off or separation (FCA A-67-02, CUB 53070; Digest 5.6.0). The regulation is not restricted to allocating only the current year balance of vacation pay but rather, any balance that is owed to the claimant.Once it is determined that the vacation pay is paid or payable by reason of a lay-off or separation, it must be allocated on the basis of normal weekly earnings to consecutive weeks, commencing with the first week of the lay-off or separation (EIR 36(9)).      In addition to vacation pay, the claimant  may receive other moneys from the same employer, at the time of lay-off or separation, that must also be taken into account. Those moneys will be combined with the vacation pay, and the total will be allocated using the claimant's normal weekly earnings (Digest 5.12.4).If the claimant receives earnings from another employment during the weeks of allocation, those earnings will not be taken into account when allocating the earnings from the first employment.  In these cases, the total earnings from both employments, allocated to each week, may exceed the normal weekly earnings (Digest 5.6.3.1).",46.42045914804471,15.122466247672255,15.579741850924794,19.086080074487896,17.49789804469274,10.966108007448792,58.51594506517691,8.375,3.6037467545222426,0.4644617250895086,0.4018989942472284,0.0517605764597223,0.900544536113739,0.9066096203667776,4.702048417132216,4.0,2.7088130347526937,33.5625,33.0,10.55325038791367,1.493482309124767,1.0,0.8589838395753736,537,185,0.3445065176908752,2604,16,5.10.3,By reason of a lay-off or separation,Chapter 5 - Earnings
256,256,"EIR 36(8)(a) describes the manner of allocating vacation pay when it is paid or payable for a specific vacation period. To apply this paragraph of the regulation, the vacation pay must be paid or payable for a specific period of vacation leave that is agreed to, either verbally or in writing, between the employer and the employee. Non-working days cannot be considered a specific vacation period unless there was an agreement between the employer and the employee that they were to be considered as a period of vacation leave (CUB 45288).    If the claimant's place of employment shuts down every year for a general vacation period, this period is deemed to be the claimant's vacation period, unless there are indications to the contrary. Moneys that have been held in trust and are paid to a claimant at the time of general vacation periods (for example in the Quebec construction industry) are not earnings at that time, due to the trust nature of the moneys (Digest 5.10.6).While still employed, employees are often paid regular wages or salary when taking vacation leave. It is paid on the regular payday or just before going on vacation. This situation falls clearly within this paragraph of the regulation; the regular wage or salary is vacation pay paid or payable for a specific vacation period, and is allocated to the period of leave.Once the vacation period has been determined, the amount to be applied to that period will be made on the basis of normal weekly earnings, to consecutive weeks commencing with the first week of the claimant's vacation period, and ending with the last week of the vacation period (EIR 36(8)(a)). Earnings from another employment during the vacation period will be allocated to the same weeks as the vacation pay, meaning the total earnings for each week may exceed the rate of normal weekly earnings (EIR 36(8)(a)(ii); Digest 5.6.3.1).    Sometimes vacation pay is calculated as a percentage of total earnings each pay, but is not paid with each pay cheque. Rather, it is paid in a lump sum at different times throughout the employment. Depending on the event that was the real reason for the payment, the entire amount may or may not be allocated. If the vacation period was the real reason for the payment, then the balance left after allocating to the period of vacation (based on normal weekly earnings), is ignored. This is because in these situations, the vacation pay is only paid or payable for the period of leave. If the payment is caused by other events such as the claimant's request for payment of the vacation pay, an anniversary date, or a lay-off or separation, then any portion of the payment that is not for a specific vacation period is considered to be paid for the specific reason (i.e. event). As such, it will be allocated under the applicable subsection (EIR 36(8)(b); EIR 36(9); EIR 36(10); CUB 21545; Digest 5.10.3; Digest 5.10.5). Should the claimant actually take a vacation, a disentitlement for failing to prove availability may also be applicable (Digest 10.11.2).",52.600403134226696,13.492371110606406,14.638296910706313,17.516420622302974,16.07322848058142,11.028030888030884,55.37406313876902,7.588235294117647,3.311023443693403,0.6961204589269316,0.4330633228890424,0.0556440138766664,0.8443884029984474,0.8453774988651276,4.727799227799228,4.0,2.538742160779295,30.47058823529412,29.0,13.164648057487472,1.4575289575289576,1.0,0.7718073322026491,518,192,0.3706563706563706,2523,17,5.10.4,Specific vacation period,Chapter 5 - Earnings
257,257,"Sometimes the payment of vacation pay may coincide with a lay-off or separation, or an anniversary date payment when, in fact, the real reason for the payment is to compensate for a specific vacation period. These specific vacation periods may be past, present, or future (CUB 73991; CUB 31967).To allocate the vacation pay to these past, present or future vacation periods, the following 3 requirements must be met:the vacation period must be scheduled by agreement between the employer and the employee (CUB 66035). This can be a written or verbal agreement. A cancelled vacation period no longer fulfills this requirement (CUB 24228). If it is a future vacation period, that future vacation period must have been scheduled before the payment of the vacation pay (CUB 67739)there must be a connection between the payment of the vacation pay and the entitlement to a vacation period, that is, claimants are entitled to a vacation period for which they are entitled to pay (CUB 73991). Sometimes, contracts list vacation pay and vacation period as 2 different entities, not connected in any way. It is not required that the claimant be paid at the same time leave is taken, andthe claimant must be employed during the scheduled vacation period (EIA 2(1); Digest 5.3.1). It has long been held that the unemployed cannot be expected to go on vacation (CUB 68591)In order to decide whether the vacation pay may be allocated to a specific vacation period rather than by reason of a lay-off or separation, or an anniversary date, it must first be determined whether the vacation pay was paid before or after the vacation leave period.When the vacation pay is paid after the leave period, allocation of vacation pay is to the leave period if the past leave period was unpaid, scheduled and taken. Taken means that the employer recognized that the claimant was on vacation leave without pay and was still considered an employee.When the vacation pay is paid before the leave period, the allocation of vacation pay to a future leave period depends on whether or not the claimant is unemployed at the time of payment, and if unemployed, whether the lay-off is temporary or indefinite. However, in all of these situations, the vacation period must also meet the 3 requirements noted above, in order to have the vacation pay allocated to the unpaid future vacation period. That is, the vacation period must have been scheduled prior to the payment, there must be a connection between the payment and the entitlement to the vacation period, and the claimant must be employed at the time that the vacation was taken.If the vacation pay is paid on an anniversary date before the leave period, while the claimant is still employed, the vacation pay is allocated to the future leave period. This may later be reconsidered and the allocation reversed.If the vacation pay is paid on an anniversary date that either coincides with a lay-off or occurs during a lay-off, allocation depends on whether the lay-off is temporary or indefinite. If the lay-off is temporary, and the claimant is expected to be back at work by the time the leave period arrives, the vacation pay is allocated to the future leave period. This may later be reconsidered and the allocation reversed.If the lay-off is indefinite, the vacation pay is allocated from the anniversary date, as a claimant cannot be on vacation leave if they are not employed. This allocation can be reversed if, later, the claimant can show that they did in fact return to work and take the scheduled leave.Situations where the vacation pay was allocated to a future leave period may later be reconsidered, should the Commission become aware that leave was not taken. Generally, agreements between the employer and the employee will show whether or not the leave was considered to have been taken. The agreement may indicate that the employee is allowed to have their leave moved ahead to another future period, or cancelled for an indefinite period or because of a permanent separation. If the leave was moved ahead to another future period, the principles outlined in Vacation pay paid before the leave period apply. If the leave was cancelled for an indefinite period or due to a permanent separation, the vacation pay should be allocated based on the reason for the payment (such as the anniversary date or date of lay-off or termination) (CUB 24228).",51.117825464190986,13.622002122015918,15.00282015840023,17.79344297082228,15.875702917771882,10.965305039787795,55.62419098143236,7.68,3.216978162363454,0.7079488731929751,0.4018333792518153,0.0624510966201772,0.8599039365847906,0.8662315503410671,4.718832891246684,4.0,2.6322808772311888,30.16,30.0,14.473921376047334,1.4787798408488064,1.0,0.7946776513575069,754,175,0.2320954907161803,3651,25,5.10.4.1,Specific vacation period payment coinciding with other circumstances,Chapter 5 - Earnings

Vacation pay may appear to be paid upon the claimant's request or on an anniversary date when, in fact, it is paid or payable for a specific vacation period or by reason of a lay-off or separation (Digest 5.10.4.1; Digest 5.10.3).Earnings are not allocated until they are received, as EIR 36(8)(b) specifically requires that they be paid (Digest 5.6.1).Once the vacation pay is paid, the regulation requires that it be allocated to the period for which it is payable. The allocation begins with the week for which the vacation pay is payable, and is based on the claimant's normal weekly earnings (EIR 36(8)).

However, although wages or salary, and in this case the vacation pay, is justly and immediately due to a person as soon as it is earned, it would not be realistic for an employer to pay the wages or salary on a continuous basis (each hour or day). Therefore, the wages or salary and the corresponding vacation pay are usually paid at regular intervals: in most cases, weekly, biweekly, semi-monthly or monthly. The fact that these earnings are not paid as soon as the work is performed does not change the fact that they became payable as soon as they are earned. Consequently, vacation pay paid as a percentage at the same time as wages or salary is allocated to the weeks it is earned. Vacation pay treated in this manner forms part of the normal weekly earnings of the claimant (Digest 5.6.3). The vacation pay is proportionate to the wages or salary earned in each week.

262,262,"Vacation pay that has the character of savings at the time the payment is made to the claimant is no longer considered income and is not allocated. This occurs when an employer, union or agency acts as a trustee, and the vacation pay is accumulated in a trust fund. The vacation pay is considered earnings at the time it is credited to each pay period.All of the following requirements must be met in order for the vacation pay to be considered as savings when it is paid to the claimant:the moneys must be set aside and kept separate from the employer's control and operations, that is, in a trust fund (FCA A-619-05; CUB 64729)the employer must also set aside the vacation pay each pay period after deducting income tax, CPP, QPP and EI premiums, where applicableemployees must be beneficially entitled to the vacation pay after it is set aside (CUB 29010)A mere book entry in the employer's books is insufficient. The vacation pay must not only be kept separate, but the employer must show what steps have been taken to put these funds beyond the needs and control of the operation. This means that there must be separate accounts that cannot be accessed by the employer for running his business. A simple bank account would not suffice without taking measures similar to a trust (like some type of signed deed), to ensure that the moneys can only be used to pay out the vacation savings of the employees. The signed deed usually shows that one person undertakes to keep another's money for certain specific purposes. The simple existence of a trust fund is not sufficient to qualify the vacation pay as savings. The trustee cannot benefit from the moneys deposited into the fund; only the employees can benefit. It cannot be considered as a trust account if the employer can borrow, interest-free, from the employees' supposedly separate account.For an arrangement to be considered a true trust as those terms are ordinarily used, the money held in the trust must be identifiable or traceable. These terms mean that there should be a paper trail (i.e. documents) to show the flow of specific amounts of money from the employer, to the fund, to the employee. Also, it should not be held in a general fund that holds types of moneys other than vacation pay, because it is not possible to identify what is and is not vacation pay.Some provincial labour standard legislations specify that vacation pay simply accruing to an employee is deemed to be held in trust by the employer. The existence of such a law is not enough to deem that the vacation pay is held in trust for the employees (FCA A-47-90, CUB 15257A).Employees must have the right to demand payment of the moneys, and are not confined by payout dates as specified in a collective agreement (FCA A-619-05; CUB 64729). People are beneficially entitled to property when they have the right to sue for and recover it (FCA A-352-90, CUB 17974).

264,264,"When an employee is unable to perform the duties of a job due to illness or injury, the employer may grant that employee a period of leave. When the employer pays the employee's salary during the leave, that period of leave is commonly referred to as paid sick leave.Often, entitlement to a period of paid sick leave is based on a formula related to the length of employment. A long-term employee may be entitled to more paid sick leave than someone who has recently started with the same company. On the other hand, an employee who has suffered from ill health may not have any sick leave entitlement remaining.Paid sick leave is earnings for benefit purposes (EIR 35(2)(c)). This subsection refers to sick leave that is paid, but also to sick leave, an employee is entitled to receive, if applied for. Therefore, even if the claimant chooses not to apply for their paid sick leave entitlement from their employer, any existing entitlement is still earnings. In these cases, the paid sick leave is allocated to the weeks for which it would have been paid or payable, had the claimant applied for it (EIR 36(12)(a)).When a claimant has insufficient sick leave to cover the period of incapacity, an employer may advance paid sick leave based on entitlement that the employee will earn from future employment. These moneys are still earnings that must be allocated to the weeks for which they are paid or payable (CUB 54287).An employer, as a gratuitous gesture, may pay an employee additional assistance during a period of illness. These moneys are earnings that arise out of employment. The payments under such terms can be said to be a transaction, and allocated to the week or weeks in which the transaction occurs.Paid sick leave prevents an interruption of earnings from occurring (EIR 14(2); Digest 2.3.1); however, any sick leave pay received during the waiting period is not considered earnings (EIR 39(3)(b); EIR 40(6)).",61.31912087912092,10.993677811550151,12.766815935922704,14.621557166238018,13.51402852466682,10.857629179331305,49.62380173018471,6.153846153846154,3.0863920006190493,0.7106149103163094,0.4779378259311704,0.0806183804125256,0.7732614104946455,0.7492278489199552,4.732522796352583,4.0,2.544713816431042,25.307692307692307,23.0,12.110927140934244,1.4164133738601823,1.0,0.7678006480858681,329,138,0.4194528875379939,1604,13,5.11.1,Paid sick leave,Chapter 5 - Earnings

268,268,"Workers who develop a work-related illness or who are injured on the job may be entitled to compensation for that illness or injury from a provincial workers' compensation board (WCB). Payments made by these boards are funded through contributions made by employers, and are paid under the provisions of provincial legislation. They may be for loss of income, prescriptions, medical treatment, rehabilitation costs (including training and medical equipment) clothing, attendant care allowances, or physical impairment.WCB payments received or to be received by a claimant, other than lump sums or pensions paid in full and final settlement of a WCB claim, are earnings for benefit purposes (EIR 35(2)(b)). Lump sums or pensions paid in full and final settlement of a WCB claim are specifically excluded from earnings (EIR 35(7)(a)).Although only full and final settlement WCB payments are specifically excluded from earnings for benefit purposes, not all other payments made by workers' compensation boards are earnings. Earnings for benefit purposes are only those moneys that replace earnings normally earned by labour, or that resemble moneys earned by labour (FCA A-241-94, CUB 24266). Moneys paid by WCB, designed to compensate a claimant for loss of income due to incapacity and that are not made in full and final settlement, clearly fall into this category.There are other moneys paid by workers' compensation that are not intended to replace the claimant's lost income such as compensation for costs related to the illness or the injury itself. These moneys are not considered earnings for EI benefit purposes. These payments may include:reimbursement of medical, chiropractic or physiotherapy costscosts in obtaining attendant care to assist with daily living, orcosts for prescriptionsIn addition, costs associated with the rehabilitation process that are not designed to replace income, are not earnings. These costs could include tuition costs or prosthetic equipment. However, any payments designed to provide income support during rehabilitation training, are earnings.Moneys may be awarded under the workers' compensation legislation for permanent impairment associated with an illness or injury. These moneys may be paid to workers in full and final settlement for disfigurement or permanent diminished capacity. They may also be paid for the loss of enjoyment of life, directly related to the illness or injury. These moneys are not earnings as they are paid in full and final settlement, and are in no way related to compensation for the workers' loss of income. They can be likened to moneys paid to accident victims by insurance companies for permanently disfiguring injuries, or settlements paid to workers as damages to health or reputation, as a result of a wrongful dismissal (Digest 5.12.11).Although there may be different names given to income support provided by WCB, their commitment to pay is either temporary or permanent and made in full and final settlement of the person's claim.Temporary income support is paid to workers during the initial stages of their illness or injury. These temporary payments continue until the worker recovers, or until an assessment process determines that full recovery is not likely. Depending on the particular workers' compensation legislation and policies, this assessment process may occur at a set point in time (after 1 or 2 years have elapsed from the date of the accident), after all retraining or rehabilitation has occurred, or only after a plateau in the recovery process has been reached. Temporary income support payments are earnings because they are not made in full and final settlement of the workers' compensation claim.A full and final settlement is only made after the worker's health has been assessed and the extent of the worker's recovery is known. Full and final settlements are made when complete recovery is not expected (CUB 31595) or to settle a particular claim.Full and final settlements may be made to compensate for a work-related injury or illness that has caused permanent damage to the worker's ability to follow their pre-injury or pre-illness occupation, or any other suitable occupation. A full and final settlement may be made when WCB determines that the disability prevents the individual from working at any suitable employment, or when it is determined that the worker can work at some occupation, but not up to the worker's previous earning capacity (CUB 20091). The decision to pay an income support pension until age 65 represents WCB's commitment to discharge their obligations to pay income support on a claim for an injury or accident. The same would be true if a lump-sum amount was paid instead of a pension.Full and final settlements may also occur when the board decides to settle all their outstanding financial obligations to a worker by making a lump-sum payment and requiring that the worker sign away all rights to future payments (CUB 61311). However, for payments not made in lieu of a disability pension, there must be documentary evidence that the settlement releases the board from any further obligation to pay for that illness or injury. This applies whether or not the actual illness or injury is permanent.Like all earnings issues, it is the terms and conditions of the payment from the provincial WCB that determines whether it is made in full and final settlement of the claim. This remains true whether the board is fully and finally settling the claim by paying income support through a pension, or making an agreement with a worker to close their claim by paying a lump-sum amount.When the specific workers' compensation legislation uses terminology relating to permanency or pensions, it is easier to determine whether the payments are made in full and final settlement. WCB may pay income support for an injury from which a claimant is not expected to recover, under a section separate from the one under which temporary income support is paid. Other WCB legislation may pay temporary and permanent income support under the same legislative provision. In these cases, the WCB policies and administrative procedures must also be examined to determine whether the particular income support payment, which the claimant is receiving, is made in full and final settlement, or is just temporary until the claimant recovers or until an assessment on the probability of recovery can be made.With workplace technological advances rapidly occurring, workers with disabilities that were thought to permanently prevent them from working, are finding and keeping employment that pays wages comparable to their pre-accident salary levels. In addition, medical science is evolving to such an extent that injuries and illnesses thought to disable an individual for the rest of their employable life may no longer do so. As a result, WCB may structure their commitment to pay income support to include a review process, and include provisions to have payments cease if the worker attains pre-accident earning capacity (CUB 38094). Although the commitment by the board is to pay a wage supplement or income support until age 65 in full and final settlement of their obligations, these supplements may be discontinued should it be discovered that the individual is again able to earn their previous level of pay. In effect, by this review process, it is not the permanency of the disability settlement that is being reviewed, but rather the level of the income support that the board is paying. The fact that there is a review process of the level of income support to be paid does not alter the nature of the settlement. The commitment to pay the income support is continuous and permanent; however, the level of income support may vary, or even cease, depending on the claimant's physical and employment circumstances.The fact that the board makes a full and final settlement at some point in time cannot alter the nature of any temporary income support payments made until the WCB legislation or procedures allow a decision to be made regarding full and final settlement.WCB payments that are earnings are allocated to the period in respect of which they are paid or payable (EIR 36(12)(d)). These earnings do not prevent an interruption of earnings from occurring and are not considered earnings in the waiting period (EIR 35(4); EIR 39(3)(a)).",44.17676762502401,14.431578408144972,14.981290276393054,17.64080169046552,17.16527309982711,12.952400589101616,60.00774796695909,9.0,3.275904380429793,0.7538066818794601,0.4505253374270235,0.0630698627196013,0.8812115510304769,0.8821475993503224,5.060382916053019,4.0,2.8524139843658616,29.52173913043478,30.0,12.447697762402532,1.568483063328424,1.0,0.8628868367359178,1358,367,0.2702503681885125,7036,46,5.11.3,Workers' compensation for an illness or injury,Chapter 5 - Earnings
269,269,"Individuals who are involved in motor vehicle accidents may receive payments from one of 2 sources, depending on the coverage in effect when the accident occurred. Coverage may be either through insurance provided under or pursuant to a provincial law, or through insurance provided by commercial insurance companies not under or pursuant to a provincial law.Payments for pain, suffering, disfigurement, or medical expenses are never considered earnings for EI purposes, as they are not meant to compensate the person for the loss of employment income. However, payments meant to compensate a person for an actual or presumed loss of employment may be earnings for EI purposes, depending on the source of those payments and whether benefits under the EI Act are taken into account when calculating those payments.When payments for an actual or presumed loss of employment are made to a person from a commercial insurance carrier or company, that are not provided under or pursuant to a provincial law, these moneys are not earnings for benefit purposes. However, the same may not be true of similar payments made by motor vehicle insurance plans under or pursuant to provincial laws.Governmental motor vehicle insurance plans may exist, which insure all drivers in a province and cover, among other things, the actual or presumed loss of employment. Payments from these plans are considered to be earnings, but only if benefits under the EI Act are not taken into account in determining the amount payable to the claimant (EIR 35(2)(d)). If EI benefits are taken into account, the moneys paid are not earnings for benefit purposes. Governmental motor vehicle insurance plans take into account benefits under the EI Act when the plan deducts any EI benefits received, from the amount they pay the injured party.Payments from provincial motor vehicle insurance plans that do not take EI into account in determining the amount payable under the plan, are allocated to the weeks for which these amounts are payable (EIR 36(12)(c)), regardless of when they are actually paid. Furthermore, it is not necessary that such compensation be actually paid. It is sufficient that it could have been paid, had the claimant applied for it (EIR 35(2)(f)). The amount of the compensation that could have been paid, as well as the period it would have covered, will be determined according to what would appear most probable under the circumstances.Motor vehicle accident compensation payments are not considered earnings if, after the date of the accident, the claimant has accumulated enough hours of insurable employment that would allow them to establish a benefit period. Once this condition has been met, any motor vehicle accident payments covering subsequent weeks are not earnings and therefore not deducted from EI benefits (EIR 35(3)). It is not necessary that a new benefit period be established. For example, a claimant may have established an earlier claim, then returned to work and accumulated enough hours that would allow them to establish a new claim, but chose to renew the previous claim.It is important to understand the terms of the applicable provincial legislation in order to determine the character and purpose of the benefits paid. Some provincial vehicle insurance plans may make a distinction regarding the benefits they provide to accident victims, depending on their employment status at the time of the accident. One type of benefits may be paid to individuals who were employed at the time of the accident and another to those who were unemployed.The benefits paid to an individual who was considered employed at the time of the accident are paid to replace the actual or presumed loss of income from employment. These moneys are earnings for EI purposes if the amount of EI benefits is not taken into account in determining the amount that the claimant receives through the insurance. However, if the benefits paid to those unemployed at the time of the accident represent an indemnity for being unable to perform the essential tasks of living these benefits are not earnings. They reimburse the disabled claimant for expenses incurred to have others perform tasks that they were able to perform prior to the accident (for example: snow removal, lawn mowing, housework) and not in respect of the actual or presumed loss of income from employment (FCA A-94-94, CUB 23985).  Provincial governmental insurance plans may take into account EI payments in determining the amount to be paid for an actual or presumed loss of employment due to an accident.  However, a particular settlement offered to an accident victim may not. It is not just the specific provisions of the provincial insurance legislation regarding whether EI payments are normally deducted that must be considered. The circumstances of the payment to that particular individual and whether EI was deducted in determining the amount to be paid must also be examined. If it can be established that the settlement was payable for an actual or presumed loss of employment, was made pursuant to or under a provincial law, and EI was not taken into account in determining the amount payable, these moneys will be considered earnings for EI benefit purposes (EIR 35(2)(d)).Some provincial governmental accident insurance plans may continue payment after the individual has recovered but has not yet been able to return to employment that was lost due to the accident. These payments are designed to compensate the accident victim for the loss of the employment, and if EI is not taken into account in the calculation, then these payments are earnings for EI benefit purposes (EIR 35(2)(d)). These types of payments may also be made in provinces where EI is normally taken into account in determining the amount payable to the accident victim, in which case they would not be considered earnings for EI.",44.5141428154206,14.526624805295947,16.25754529780659,19.057230010384217,17.230457554517137,12.695784008307374,61.97329309449637,9.59375,3.3008339230561603,0.6016820861136939,0.4566812300926056,0.0673241115886437,0.8851521784259427,0.8744221289952596,5.013499480789201,4.0,2.7774541984066765,30.09375,29.0,12.84367396571168,1.557632398753894,1.0,0.8449664053913862,963,256,0.2658359293873312,4921,32,5.11.4,Motor vehicle accident insurance payments,Chapter 5 - Earnings
270,270,"Continuing to work in a particular job may entail physical danger to a worker's health. The physical danger that the job presents may not only be to the worker's health; it could include danger to an unborn child or to a child the worker is breast-feeding. In this situation, if the employer cannot reassign the worker to another area or to other duties, the worker may become unemployed. Individuals in these situations are not incapacitated; however, they may have been if preventative measures were not taken. Under provincial legislation, indemnification may be paid to workers in these situations. The amount of EI benefits to which a worker is entitled may be taken into account in calculating the amount of indemnification to which they may be entitled under the provincial legislation.In order to prevent double indemnification, any payment received for withdrawal of services as a preventative measure is earnings if EI benefits are not taken into account in the calculation of the amount to be paid under the provincial legislation. Even if the claimant chooses not to apply for the payments to which they would have been entitled under the provincial law, that entitlement is nevertheless earnings (EIR 35(2)(f)).Preventative withdrawal payments are allocated to the weeks in respect of which those payments are paid or payable. If the claimant has not applied for payments to which they may have been entitled, these payments are allocated to the weeks for which they would have been paid or payable had the claimant applied (EIR 36(12)(c)).Preventative withdrawal payments do not prevent an interruption of earnings and are not considered earnings in the waiting period (EIR 35(4); EIR 39(3)(a.1)).",43.350790212595285,14.858820697954275,14.554592549557764,17.509667067789813,17.899971921379866,13.126498194945846,59.29763337344565,8.777777777777779,3.108564809294355,0.5221076097411622,0.4128449216454568,0.0723313192037305,0.927098773419857,0.8944836258888245,5.0830324909747295,4.0,3.2959280493550764,30.77777777777778,32.0,14.687695362504234,1.5631768953068592,1.0,0.9911966372835422,277,110,0.3971119133574007,1438,9,5.11.5,Withdrawal of services as a preventative measure payments,Chapter 5 - Earnings

272,272,"Employers may supplement their employees' EI benefits during a period of unemployment due to illness, injury or quarantine. These supplemental unemployment benefit (SUB) payments make up a percentage of the difference between the amount of the claimant's EI benefits and the employee's normal wages while employed. When there is more than one employment, only the portion of the benefit rate and the normal weekly earnings from the employer that pays the SUB are to be considered.As these payments are moneys arising out of employment, they would normally be earnings to be deducted from EI benefits. However, payments made by an employer to supplement EI benefits are excluded from consideration as earnings, if they are made under a SUB Plan that meets specific conditions (EIR 37; Digest 5.5.2).SUB plans are reviewed at the national level to determine if all required conditions are met, and a list of the SUB plans that meet the conditions is maintained.

274,274,"Some employers offer critical illness benefits through a group plan financed by the employer. These plans may provide a tax-free lump sum payment through an insurance provider, to employees on medical leave, in the event they (or a dependent) are diagnosed with a critical illness specifically covered by the plan. The payment may be used for any purpose, including subsidizing the cost of out of country treatment, paying down debts, or taking a vacation with the family while dealing with the disease.Although this is a group plan, generally, it is not meant to compensate for the loss of wages.  It is more in line with a type of life insurance benefit. Pursuant to EIR 35(2)(c) and Digest 5.11.2.1, group wage loss insurance plans are earnings for EI benefit purposes. However, this coverage differs in that the amount paid is not related to loss of wages. If a claimant or their dependant is ill with one of the illnesses or diseases covered by the plan, the claimant may be eligible for a lump sum payment.In order to determine whether critical illness payments are earnings, full details of the payments must be obtained from the employer, and/or the plan. Factors to consider include:Does the employer have any type of wage loss insurance plan or sick leave plan, to which the claimant is entitled?If not, are critical illness payments meant to replace wage loss insurance payments?If these payments are payable because the employee or dependent has been diagnosed with a critical illness, does the person have to be on leave without pay in order to have access to the payments from the insurance company?If it is a dependent who has a critical illness, could the claimant continue working and access this payment?Is the lump sum payment the same amount in all cases; does it vary based on the employee's rate of pay, or is it equivalent to a specific period of time, based on the employee's pay rate?As with any type of earnings, it must be determined whether the payment is considered earnings under EIR 35 and, if so, can it be excluded under EIR 35(3) or EIR 35(7)?In many cases the determination process is straightforward, because the name or the nature of the payment clearly indicates that the moneys are income arising out of employment.  The allocation is then based on the applicable section of EIR 36. As previously stated, the true nature of the payments must be established to determine whether they are advantages related to, attached to or arising out of employment. Relying solely on the terms used by the parties is sometimes insufficient because the name given to a payment does not necessarily determine its true nature. When doubt exists about the true nature of a payment, the best way to clarify the issue is to examine the intentions of the parties, by reviewing all relevant documents and contacting all the parties involved.In most cases of critical illness payments, the intention of the payment is to cover additional expenses arising from the critical illness, and it is not meant as an income replacement in the event of incapacity. The policy may state that for benefits to be payable, the employee must satisfy a survival period, which is defined as a minimum number of consecutive days immediately following the date of diagnosis of a covered illness, or from the date of a surgery. The survival period and other conditions are normally specified in the plan. There may be different conditions based on the type of illness, or benefits may only be payable once to an employee. Further evidence that the payment is not linked to the employee's incapacity to work and loss of wages may be:not all employees who become ill and unable to work are entitled to access this benefitit is a lump sum payment based on conditions related to the illness, as per the policythe nature of the payment is a lump sum amount paid out regardless of the amount of time the person is off workit is not based on a percentage of the person's wagesit is linked to the critical illness itself; specifically, to assist with the recovery of the illnessIn most cases, based on the information provided, the payment would not be considered as earnings under EIR 35(2)(c)(i), as it is not a wage loss plan.

275,275,"When an employer-employee relationship is temporarily or permanently severed, certain rights and expectations exist. In the workplace, the employee's rights are protected by labour or contractual agreements and by statutory requirements.Employees have the right to receive adequate notice of impending lay-offs, or at least pay in lieu of that notice. When the termination of employment is permanent, employees may expect to receive compensation, such as severance pay (Digest 5.12.6) retirement payments (Digest 5.12.7), or payment for the loss of that employment. Other moneys such as vacation pay (Digest 5.10.0), statutory holiday pay (Digest 5.7.2.1), commissions (Digest 5.8.0), accumulated sick leave credits (Digest 5.12.8), or bonuses (Digest 5.14.0) may also be owed at the time of lay-off or separation. If the employer does not pay these moneys, or makes an insufficient or otherwise unsatisfactory offer to settle any amounts owing, an employee may take action through their union, a labour arbitration process or through the Courts (Digest 5.12.11 to 5.12.13).It is reasonable to conclude that moneys paid or payable as a result of or at the time of a lay-off or separation, are paid by reason of that lay-off or separation. However, if a claimant can show that the payment was only coincidental to the lay-off or separation, the earnings cannot be said to be paid or payable by reason of a lay-off or separation (FCA A-140-03, CUB 56407).

276,276,"Normally the last day of work coincides with the date of lay-off or separation and the allocation commences from that date. However, in some cases, a separation may occur during a period of lay-off resulting in a date of separation different from the last day of work. When this occurs and termination moneys are paid or payable, it is essential to determine which event triggered the right to the moneys; the lay-off, or the separation. When termination moneys are paid as a result of the later separation and not because of the earlier lay-off, the allocation of earnings commences from the date of the later separation (FCA A-392-07, CUB 68663).Lay-offLay-off normally refers to a temporary stoppage of work, or to a period of inactivity or idleness, that is, a shortage of work, or a general vacation period. During a lay-off period the employee often retains residual employment benefits such as recall or seniority rights. The lay-off may last for only a few days, or it may be for a substantial period. The key is whether the employer considers the person an employee with certain rights or obligations during the period of lay-off.SeparationA separation refers to the final and complete severance of the employer-employee relationship. Usually it involves a dismissal, a restructuring, a closure or a voluntary separation. A separation may occur immediately on the last day of work. It may also occur during a lay-off, when recall rights expire or are surrendered (Digest 5.12.6.1), or it may be the result of an event unrelated to the original stoppage of work, such as a later decision to close the plant.TerminationThe terms termination, termination moneys, or termination earnings are often used in reference to either a lay-off or a separation.

277,277,"The nature of any moneys paid or payable at the time of a lay-off or separation must be examined to determine whether they are part of the entire income arising out of employment. The payment of severance pay, pay in lieu of notice, and vacation pay is intended to compensate for the loss of wages or other benefits or advantages related to employment, or to pay out unused entitlement to certain benefits under the terms of the contract, collective agreement or legislation. As such, these moneys are income arising out of the employment relationship with the employer.Moneys paid by an employer, or any other person, at the time of, or by reason of a termination of employment, are payable in relation to that employment. Payments made by reason of a lay-off or separation are intended to compensate for the loss of wages and other benefits related to that employment, unless there is evidence to the contrary. Any income arising out of employment and paid by reason of a lay-off or separation is earnings to be allocated.If the claimant is able to establish that the payments are not related to the employment, or are not intended to compensate for the loss of wages or other employment-related benefits, the moneys are not earnings. For instance, a payment made after the termination of employment that is intended to reimburse a job-related expense, or money paid to compensate for losses unrelated to advantages arising from employment are not income (Digest 5.12.2.1; Digest 5.12.11; Digest 5.12.13).A payout of equity in a business (that is, a return of the amount a claimant invested in a business) is not related to employment, even if the claimant was employed by that business (FCA A-572-95, CUB 28759; Digest 5.16.0). If a payment does not arise out of employment, it is not earnings (Digest 5.3.1.6).Relying solely on the terms used by the parties involved to describe payments is sometimes insufficient. When doubt exists about the true nature of separation payments, the intentions of the parties must be examined by reviewing all relevant documents and contacting all parties involved (CUB 53378). Ultimately, the onus is on the claimant to provide adequate facts to show that any income received upon the termination of employment is not earnings (CUB 55218).",45.17909090909092,15.652727272727272,15.786528217884907,19.61038961038961,18.714701298701293,11.62410389610389,64.0909090909091,10.181818181818182,3.264769019296676,0.6591537816381251,0.5252970347294977,0.0358784354544012,0.9123310267925262,0.922548234462738,4.807792207792208,4.0,2.855742277731378,35.0,30.0,16.73320053068151,1.490909090909091,1.0,0.8029461689161334,385,142,0.3688311688311688,1901,11,5.12.2,Lay-off or separation moneys: Income arising out of employment,Chapter 5 - Earnings
278,278,"Proper notice or pay in lieu of notice is a legislated requirement in all provinces and generally cannot be substituted with other payments. When employment ceases, an employer may make payments in addition to pay in lieu of notice or severance pay. These additional payments may be referred to as expenses, costs, or allowances (for example, moving expenses, moving costs, or moving allowances). Although claimants and employers may use the terms interchangeably, an allowance differs slightly from a straight reimbursement of an actual expense or cost. An allowance is a set amount that is designed to reimburse an anticipated expense or cost associated with employment, or a set amount intended to mitigate the loss of employment (Digest 5.3.2; Digest 5.3.3.1; Digest 5.3.3.2). The same general principles apply whether the expenses are paid during employment or on termination.The payment of job-related allowances and the reimbursement of job-related expenses and costs, are excluded as income when the moneys do not represent a gain or a benefit. On termination of employment, the definition of job-related expenses is expanded to include payments related to the loss of employment. Relocation costs associated with a move to another community, tuition and text-book costs associated with retraining, or other moneys specifically paid to reimburse actual expenses related to job loss and re-employment, are intended to mitigate the employment loss, and are not income.Moneys provided as a living allowance while attending a course, cannot be treated in the same way as those provided to cover the direct, specific and actual costs or expenses associated with the termination, such as tuition fees or books, which are associated with the taking of a course. A living allowance is more like a wage or income replacement or income support allowance, and is intended to permit the individual to survive while attending the course. As such, a living allowance paid by an employer is considered earnings paid by reason of a lay-off or separation. However, a living allowance is not deducted from benefits if the claimant is attending a course, to which they have been referred by the Commission, or a designated authority (EIA 19(4); EIR 16(1)).A claimant cannot claim an expense for which the employer did not expressly intend to reimburse. For instance, a decision to move to another location or to go to school, does not entitle the claimant to claim the expense of the move or the cost of the tuition and books, if the employer did not expressly intend to reimburse the claimant for these costs. The exception to this rule would be any expenses directly incurred to obtain termination moneys, such as legal fees, court costs and other legitimate expenses directly related to the legal action (Digest 5.12.11.4).The best way for the claimant to prove that moneys are intended to compensate for an expense is to show that the employer either pays a third party directly for the expense, such as paying a moving company or university, or only reimburses the claimant the actual amount of the cost or expense when bona fide receipts are presented. The employer's statement to this effect is generally sufficient and the Commission does not require receipts from the claimant.When the employer gives the employee a lump sum that is specifically intended to reimburse an expense or cost, the claimant must demonstrate that the cost or expense was actually incurred, by providing receipts. An exception to providing receipts would be for a relocation. Receipts are not required when the move, which the employer intended to compensate, actually occurred and the allowance paid by the employer is reasonable under the circumstances. Even when the expense or cost is less than the amount paid by the employer, the payment is not considered income. For example, the employer may calculate a moving allowance based on hiring a moving company, but the employee may rent a truck to move, and be able to keep the difference. As long as the employer based the payment on a reasonable estimate of the expense or cost, the difference is not considered a gain or a benefit. However, in the situation where the claimant moves to a closer location than that which the employer intended to reimburse, only the actual cost of the move can be considered; the balance is considered income. If the claimant does not move at all, then any payment made by the employer is considered a benefit to the claimant because there was no expenditure. The entire amount would therefore be considered earnings paid or payable by reason of the lay-off or separation and allocated (EIR 36(9); EIR 36(10)).There may be situations where payments are made for job search and job training expenses, or costs that have not yet been incurred by the claimant. This may be because the claimant did not have the funds required to incur these expenses prior to receiving the moneys from the employer. In these situations, the claimant must demonstrate that there is a genuine intent to spend the moneys for the purpose for which they were paid, in order that these moneys not be considered earnings paid or payable by reason of the lay-off or separation (FCA A-567-99, CUB 42598A).If the amount paid by the employer appears excessive in relation to the intended expense, or there is reason to doubt the validity of the payment, receipts would be required as proof of the expenditure. Excessive means exceeding the usual, proper, or normal and implies an amount too great to be reasonable or acceptable. When receipts are required and the compensation exceeds the receipts, the balance is considered income, and allocated. Likewise, when the expenditure did not actually occur, the Commission may conclude from the evidence that the money was intended to compensate for the loss of wages and would allocate the entire amount as earnings (CUB 33178).When the amount of the expense or cost incurred exceeds the amount that was given in the agreement for a specific purpose, only that portion of a termination payment that was specifically intended to reimburse that expense or cost can be excluded as income. In other words, the costs that exceed the amount given by the employer for this specific purpose cannot be claimed to reduce other moneys that are earnings, such as severance pay or vacation pay.",44.98911442483264,15.478880097382838,15.820507952093084,19.45100426049909,18.763547778454047,12.168528301886788,63.91052951917224,10.161290322580646,3.284542650930384,0.9302542695364812,0.4687907504398129,0.0586586435953039,0.8975130637486776,0.8955525385922399,4.90377358490566,4.0,2.767429313521842,34.193548387096776,27.0,19.68201955746823,1.5028301886792452,1.0,0.790862622801993,1060,293,0.2764150943396226,5313,31,5.12.2.1,Expenses costs and allowances paid or payable by reason of a lay-off or separation,Chapter 5 - Earnings
279,279,"Employees may choose to have termination earnings (for example, severance pay) which are payable on separation, sent directly to a financial institution to purchase a regular RRSP, or a non-commutable and locked-in RRSP. Whether the claimant accepts a cheque and deposits it into a savings account; accepts a direct deposit payment and purchases a RRSP; or has the employer purchase the RRSP, the result is the same for EI purposes (CUB 47731). The termination earnings are considered paid or payable by reason of the lay-off or separation and are allocated from the date of the event that gave right to the money (EIR 36(9); Digest 5.6.1). Purchasing a RRSP does not alter the nature of the earnings, nor the fact that the earnings were immediately due and therefore considered paid or payable. The critical factor is not where the employee ultimately directed the money, but rather the reason for the payment and the fact it was paid or payable. This does not include pension credits transferred from one locked-in vehicle to another. The same is true when employees choose to have all or part of their severance or other termination pay deposited directly into their pension plan, in order to purchase additional pension credits and enhance their pension entitlement (CUB 42897). The choice to use one benefit (that is, the severance pay), to improve another (that is, the pension), does not alter the nature of the severance pay, nor the fact that it was paid or payable.",49.94315986055777,14.087684262948212,14.37465228746014,17.4902390438247,16.56901394422311,11.110438247011947,59.66185258964144,8.875,3.683345939333834,0.6219187915407871,0.4267868991472581,0.0378842405662963,0.9017424072538104,0.872864693403244,4.7370517928286855,4.0,2.5628711320604043,31.375,35.0,8.01463505095522,1.4780876494023905,1.0,0.7999738095108111,251,117,0.4661354581673306,1229,8,5.12.3,Termination moneys used to purchase RRSPs or pension credits and to enhance pensions,Chapter 5 - Earnings
280,280,"Once moneys are determined to be earnings paid or payable by reason of a lay-off or separation, the allocation always starts from the week of the lay-off or separation, whichever event was the reason for the payment (CUB 45664; Digest 5.6.1). The allocation is such that the total earnings from that employment are, in each consecutive week except the last, equal to the claimant's normal weekly earnings from that employment (EIR 36(9)).If the earnings are paid by reason of a lay-off or separation, that fact remains the same, regardless of the method or date of payment. These earnings are allocated from the week of the lay-off or separation, and not from the date of payment.Earnings paid or payable by reason of a lay-off or separation are allocated consecutively if there are other earnings from the same employment. However, they are allocated over the same period as any earnings from any other employment (Digest 5.6.3.1).Termination earnings from past employments that might affect a current entitlement to benefits are also allocated. This is necessary because neither the act nor the regulations prescribe a maximum period of time over which the earnings may be allocated (FCA A-159-13, CUB 80192A). These earnings are allocated concurrently with any earnings from other employment.If an allocation of earnings by reason of a lay-off or separation has already been made, any subsequent earnings paid or payable by reason of that same lay-off or separation are added to the previously allocated earnings (EIR 36(10)). The revised combined total is then allocated from the date of the lay-off or separation (EIR 36(9)).The claimant's choice of the method or time of payment, a delay by the employer in issuing payment, or a payment of separation moneys made prior to the termination of employment, do not affect the period for which the earnings are allocated. Any allocation of earnings begins from the date of the lay-off or separation. In other words, the method or timing of payment only affects when the Commission takes action to allocate the money, not the period for which it is allocated. For example, if an employee chooses to receive quarterly payments for 3 years, the earnings cannot be allocated until each payment is made, because the earnings are not payable until each quarterly period arrives. Regardless of the number of payments made, there was not a series of lay-offs or separations and therefore only one event that triggered the claimant's right to those moneys; the initial lay-off or separation (EIR 36(9); EIR 36(10)). Each subsequent payment is added to the termination money that has already been allocated, and the entire amount is allocated from the date of separation.In this situation, if the claimant agrees, the entire amount that will ultimately be received in separation pay may be allocated immediately from the date of the lay-off or separation. By doing so, once the allocation has ended, the claimant will be entitled to benefits (assuming all other entitlement conditions are met) without the requirement to recalculate the allocation multiple times. However, if the claimant does not agree to this method of allocation, then an allocation can only be amended each time a payment is made.On the other hand, if the payment is only delayed because of administrative reasons, such as the timing of the employer's payroll run, the earnings are still payable and would be allocated immediately, even if the actual payment has not yet been made (Digest 5.6.1).",46.63445578231294,14.870068027210888,14.944652815392658,18.304761904761904,17.71639455782313,11.773877551020409,59.53741496598639,8.777777777777779,3.364590114883713,0.7355807958547417,0.4546546091316075,0.0470750778508581,0.8959747728179482,0.8944057300686836,4.843537414965986,4.0,2.768139138377341,32.666666666666664,31.0,12.574224075906676,1.501700680272109,1.0,0.8718951710608708,588,186,0.3163265306122449,2938,18,5.12.4,Allocation of earnings paid or payable by reason of a lay-off or separation,Chapter 5 - Earnings
281,281,"By law, an employer must give employees adequate notice of a lay-off. Wages paid in lieu of notice (also known as pay in lieu of notice) are payments made when the employer has been unable to provide sufficient notification of a lay-off or separation. The termination of employment may involve a complete severance of the employer-employee relationship, or it may simply be a temporary lay-off, where the period of lay-off may or may not be known.Usually the calculation of the number of weeks of notice that must be given, or paid, is based on the number of years the employee has been employed by the company. Provincial legislation generally dictates the minimum notice that must be given. Collective agreements, company policy or the circumstances of the lay-off may prescribe a greater period. The employer can:give the proper notice and expect the employee to work during the notice periodrelease the employee immediately without notice and pay wages in lieu of notice, orprovide both a proper notice period and pay wages in lieu of noticeOccasionally wages in lieu of notice may be paid when there is no requirement to do so, such as, when an employee is dismissed for cause.In some provinces, if a lay-off is expected to last less than a specific period of time set by that province's legislation, wages or pay in lieu of notice do not need to be paid when the employee ceases to work. Even when the lay-off is for an indefinite period, which may exceed the time period set by legislation, the employer may delay payment until the time limit is reached. When the lay-off exceeds this legislated time period, the lay-off is no longer considered temporary, and wages in lieu of notice, if not already paid, become payable. In these cases, it will have to be determined which event triggered the payment; the initial lay off, or the complete severance of employment. Allocation of wages in lieu of notice will begin from the date of the event that triggered the payment.Decisions regarding the allocation of wages in lieu of notice must be made on a case-by-case basis, in accordance with the applicable labour standards legislation, and the specific facts of each case. Whether wages in lieu of notice become payable upon the temporary lay-off or upon complete severance of employment, depends on the relevant employment standards legislation that governs those payments.In cases where the initial lay off is permanent, regardless of when wages in lieu of notice are actually paid, they would be allocated from the date of the initial lay-off.When a claimant on a temporary layoff is later separated from employment and receives wages in lieu of notice as a result of the complete separation, a determination must be made whether the moneys should be allocated from the week of the temporary lay-off or from the week of the complete separation from employment. In these cases, the trigger of the payment would need to be determined; is it the temporary layoff that occurred earlier, or the permanent separation from employment.If the provincial or territorial labour standards deem that wages in lieu of notice are only payable upon complete severance of employment, the earnings will be allocated beginning on the date of the complete severance. In some provincial employment legislation, if the period of lay-off exceeds what is considered a temporary lay-off under that legislation, then the date of termination is deemed to be the date of the initial temporary lay-off. In those cases, the earnings will be allocated from the initial lay-off date.If the employer issues wages in lieu of notice during a period of temporary lay-off, and the lay-off remains temporary (that is, no termination has occurred), the payment is allocated from the date of the initial lay-off.",49.26004065040651,14.148954703832754,15.086291978052373,18.104994192799072,16.20973359465738,10.743231707317072,55.01858304297329,7.428571428571429,3.3462395437578296,0.8388880293167201,0.4495101827548576,0.0696082033115092,0.9074419736862184,0.9117783872704756,4.675304878048781,4.0,2.744128971001254,31.23809523809524,31.0,13.158031267939462,1.4878048780487805,1.0,0.8499483834976986,656,183,0.2789634146341463,3153,21,5.12.5,Wages in lieu of notice,Chapter 5 - Earnings
282,282,"Severance pay is a form of recognition for years of service and is paid to compensate for the loss of employment. It is almost always paid only when the employer-employee relationship completely terminates. Collective agreements or company policy may contain a clause requiring the payment of severance pay in certain circumstances. Factors such as length of service and the employee's position may dictate the amount of the payment. Severance pay paid in compliance with provincial legislative requirements is a legislated form of recognition for service, and the amount is based on a formula related to the years of employment with that employer.Labour legislation, when applicable, may require the payment of severance pay immediately upon separation or when, by provincial statute, a separation is determined to have occurred. In those provinces where such legislation exists, the last day of work, that is, date of lay-off, is the date used to calculate the beginning of the lay-off period. When the claimant has not been recalled to work after a designated number of weeks or months, the provincial legislation states that a separation occurs at that time, and requires the payment of severance pay (Digest 5.12.6.1). In this scenario, the lay-off and separation have occurred at different times. Severance pay is payable by reason of the separation, which occurred only after a certain period of time had passed, and not by reason of the initial lay-off. In this case, the severance pay would be allocated from the week of the separation from employment. Wages in lieu of notice may also be payable and would be allocated from the week in which the lay-off or separation occurred, depending on which event gave right to the money (EIR 36(9); Digest 5.12.5).Severance pay is earnings paid or payable by reason of a lay-off or separation. It is therefore allocated at normal weekly earnings from the week in which the lay-off or separation occurred, depending on which event gave right to the money (Digest 5.12.4).Where a Court issues a valid Order directing the division of severance pay as a matrimonial asset, only the portion of the severance pay that the claimant retains, is allocated (CUB 29337).",48.21410535117059,13.566847826086956,15.402047736947557,17.844816053511703,15.774688545150504,11.931195652173908,56.025083612040135,7.846153846153846,3.1505675226964835,0.9405363948814448,0.4914689438110453,0.0738849323046528,0.8821546385685602,0.8984124714677985,4.894021739130435,4.0,2.9149478180811585,28.307692307692307,26.0,14.11155890306086,1.5353260869565215,1.0,0.899185562759986,368,146,0.3967391304347826,1851,13,5.12.6,Severance pay,Chapter 5 - Earnings
283,283,"The terms of a collective agreement, contract or company policy may state that a laid-off employee retains recall rights until they are surrendered, or a specified period of time expires. The payment of severance pay may then be linked to the surrender and expiration of recall rights. The issue to be determined is whether it is the lay-off or a subsequent separation of employment that is the reason for the payment of the severance pay.When the payment of severance pay is dependent upon the surrender or expiry of recall rights, there is no entitlement to severance pay until one of those events occurs, resulting in a separation from employment (FCA A-392-07, CUB 68663). In this case, the severance pay is payable by reason of the termination of the employer-employee relationship (that is, the separation from employment), and not because of the cessation of work (that is, the lay-off). Allocation of the severance pay commences with the week in which the separation occurred.Sometimes an employee does not wish to take immediate advantage of a legislative right to severance pay, if the right to the payment is conditional on relinquishing recall rights. If the option of maintaining the employer-employee relationship is available with the employer, the employee may be able to request that the severance pay be paid in trust directly to a provincial labour department. In some provinces, the severance pay must be paid in trust to the provincial labour department when an employee chooses to retain their recall rights. This ensures that the money is available to be paid at the time the recall rights expire. If the severance pay is only payable when a separation occurs, which might happen only when the recall rights are surrendered or expire, then the severance pay, even if paid in trust to a provincial labour department, is not considered paid nor payable to the claimant until one of the events occurs. Only when the severance pay is immediately due to the claimant can an allocation occur. When doubt exists, the provincial legislation and the employer's policy regarding recall rights must be examined.In order to allocate severance pay beginning with the week that recall rights are surrendered or expire, first, there must have been a possibility of recall with that employer. If there was never a possibility of recall, allocation of the severance pay will start with the week that the lay-off occurred.There may be cases in which recall rights are maintained, even though it may appear that they no longer exist due to a permanent reduction in the employer's workforce, closure at one of the employer's business locations, or receivership. As long as there is even a slight possibility of recall, severance pay would be payable at the time those rights are surrendered or they expire, and not from the date of the lay-off. The possibility of a recall can be with the same employer at the same location (if the employer continues to operate the business at a reduced level), at another of the employer's business locations, with a successor employer (CUB 41053A), or with a receiver. When a business ceases operations entirely and there is no arrangement with a successor employer to maintain recall rights, or an employer is bankrupt, recall rights do not exist. As such, the permanent separation is considered to occur when the employer ceases operations or the bankruptcy occurs, ending the employer-employee relations.  In cases where no actual recall rights exist, allocation should not take place until the severance pay is payable at the end of the recall period, unless the claimant agrees to allocation (Digest 5.12.4).In other cases the severance pay is not linked to recall rights and is payable even though the employee still retains recall rights. When the payment of severance pay is not linked to the recall rights being surrendered or having expired, the severance pay is considered payable by reason of the lay-off, and would be allocated from that date.Whether the severance pay is payable immediately by reason of the lay-off, and recall rights are not affected, or whether it is payable only when the separation is final and recall rights have been surrendered or expired, the employee may have the right to choose the method or time of payment. If the employee chooses to have multiple payments made over a specific period, the allocation of severance pay must be recalculated each time a payment is made.  The amount of each additional payment is added to any previous amounts and is allocated from the date of the initial lay-off or separation, whichever event gave right to the payment.",46.07024203821655,14.634089171974528,15.540361756968949,18.572738853503186,16.901999999999994,11.51128662420382,56.49554140127388,7.88,3.2335453318706966,0.6414448744768614,0.458473895140729,0.0405886429222333,0.9098185201485952,0.9032931923866272,4.805095541401274,4.0,2.736676960667844,31.4,29.0,11.415778554264268,1.5235668789808918,1.0,0.8534784671770256,785,221,0.2815286624203821,3867,25,5.12.6.1,Recall rights,Chapter 5 - Earnings
284,284,"Retirement payments (also referred to as retirement benefits or allowances) are generally a form of severance pay. Retirement payments may be in lieu of severance pay (CUB 39180), in addition to severance pay, or an enhancement of severance pay. The term retirement does not necessarily mean the employee is retiring from the workforce, rather only from a specific employment. The payment may be paid periodically, or in a lump sum. Retirement benefits are usually paid from general company revenue funds, but any return of employer contributions is paid out of a pension fund. For the purposes of this section, retirement payments or benefits do not refer to pensions (Digest 5.13.5).The amount of the retirement payment may be based on years of service, or a formula related to the number of months left before the employee reaches early or normal retirement age. The employer may be fulfilling a contractual obligation to a departing employee, offering a gratuitous payment in consideration of the employee's circumstances, or offering an early retirement incentive outside the usual terms of the employment contract.Lump sum or periodic retirement payments are often offered as an incentive for early retirement. These incentives can be offered in many different forms. Some employees may be given a leave of absence with full or reduced pay prior to going on pension. The continuance of an employee's salary, even without the performance of services, would prevent an interruption of earnings. However, if an interruption of earnings from another employment has occurred, allowing the claimant to establish an EI claim, the salary continuance earnings are allocated on that claim, to the period for which they are payable (EIR 36 (5)). If the employee is receiving their usual pay for the period of leave, there may be an issue of not unemployed that must be addressed (Digest Chapter 4). In other cases, the claimant may cease to be an employee, yet still receive a periodic payment equivalent to the normal salary, or a reduced salary. The reduced salary may equal what the pension would be. This is a type of bridging benefit, but it is not a pension bridging benefit (Digest 5.13.5.2). If the claimant is no longer an employee, the payments are considered paid or payable by reason of the lay-off or separation and allocated like all other termination earnings (EIR 36(9); EIR 36(10)).A payment of all or a portion of the employer's pension contributions that were not locked in to the pension fund, is also considered a type of retirement benefit. Such payments are earnings, whether made under the terms of the pension plan, or as a gratuitous payment by the employer, as they arise out of employment (Digest 5.13.8.2). Since they were paid by reason of a lay-off or separation, they would be allocated in the same manner as any other termination payment (EIR 36(9); CUB 60041). A return of the employee's own pension contributions has no impact on EI benefits, as these moneys were part of the claimant's gross earnings during the period of employment (EIR 35(2); EIR 36(4); EIR 36(5); Digest 5.13.8.1).",50.266905339805874,12.6451213592233,15.112257680678326,17.13495145631068,14.446262135922332,11.765436893203884,56.817961165048544,8.0,3.2145829210472066,0.9622780170008116,0.4496045739974311,0.0701969717442988,0.8606600918267903,0.8429149985313416,4.883495145631068,4.0,2.8730450368828224,25.75,22.5,13.072394577888168,1.541747572815534,1.0,0.8520135228249802,515,204,0.3961165048543689,2604,20,5.12.7,Retirement payments,Chapter 5 - Earnings
285,285,"The payment of accumulated sick leave credits is a form of compensation for all or a portion of an employee's unused sick leave. If they are paid at the time of a lay-off or separation, or on an anniversary date, these moneys are not paid to compensate for incapacity (Digest 5.11.1; Digest 5.11.2). Compensation for unused sick leave credits or payments based on some type of sick leave formula, may be given different names by employers and employees. Regardless of the name given to the money, it is income arising out of employment and therefore, earnings that must be allocated (EIR 35(2)); CUB 26528A).When any payment, including the payment of accumulated sick leave credits, is made by reason of a lay-off or separation, the earnings are allocated from the week of the event that gave right to the money (EIR 36(9)). However, if the reason for the payment of the accumulated sick leave credits is because the employment contract requires it be paid on an anniversary date, then the earnings are only allocated to the week of the transaction, (that is, the week of the anniversary date) (EIR 36(19)(b); FCA A-1028-91, CUB 20198).",54.11608843537417,13.826530612244898,13.5591,17.148299319727894,16.651037414965984,10.443877551020408,56.13605442176871,7.666666666666667,3.630258474010381,0.7846965360225023,0.4272277231378109,0.0472237982802789,0.9001018285751343,0.8848344534635544,4.61734693877551,4.0,2.740755352095777,32.666666666666664,28.5,10.33870827951388,1.413265306122449,1.0,0.7809123072749447,196,92,0.4693877551020408,944,6,5.12.8,Accumulated sick leave credits,Chapter 5 - Earnings
286,286,"The Wage Earner Protection Program (WEPP) provides for the payment of outstanding eligible wages to individuals whose employer is bankrupt or subject to a receivership within the meaning of subsection 243(2) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. This program compensates employees up to an amount equal to 7 times the maximum weekly insurable earnings under the EI Act. It may include payments for loss of wages, unpaid vacation pay, severance pay and wages in lieu of notice. The government department that administers this program meets the criteria of any other person, as defined by the EI legislation (EIR 35(1); Digest 5.3.2). As such, a payment pursuant to WEPP is income arising out of employment (EIR 35(1); CUB 77210; Digest 5.3.1).Payments made to compensate for unpaid wages are allocated to the period in which the work was performed (EIR 36(4)). Other WEPP payments such as vacation pay, severance pay and wages in lieu of notice are considered paid or payable by reason of the lay-off or separation, and are allocated from the date of the event that gave right to the money (EIR 36(9), EIR 36(10)). The event that gives rise to the payment is the separation from the employer and not the settlement of the bankruptcy, or when subsequent employment with the trustee ends (CUB 40137; FCA A-560-94, CUB 25305).",51.555810810810826,13.947039897039897,14.554592549557764,17.730759330759334,17.001196911196907,11.448288288288284,56.48906048906049,7.857142857142857,3.6584840448948497,0.7572384006309084,0.4896847541512789,0.0553954745186464,0.8372308810551962,0.8221941828727722,4.792792792792793,4.0,2.72663577522904,31.714285714285715,36.0,9.676396698214914,1.454954954954955,1.0,0.779955963037177,222,123,0.5540540540540541,1103,7,5.12.9,Wage Earner Protection Program,Chapter 5 - Earnings
287,287,"The value of some non-pecuniary fringe benefits is not allocated when these fringe benefits are received during periods of employment (Digest 5.3.2.2). This would include any of the following fringe benefits that are not a normal part of an employee's wages:insurance type benefitssavings obtained by financing or purchasing through the employer (for example, reduced interest on loans or mortgages)staff discounts on product purchases, or subsidized mealsfree use of an employer's product or service such as:      free transportation for airline, rail, bus employees or car rental employeesfree hotel stays for hotel employeesfree or subsidized attendance at courses for school employees or their dependantsThe value of these non-pecuniary fringe benefits is not allocated, even if the employer continues to provide them after the employee has stopped working. This may occur when the employer continues health or dental insurance coverage, or allows the free use of a company product (for example, a cell phone) during the period of lay-off, or for a specific period beyond the separation from employment.If the employer pays the claimant moneys in lieu of offering the insurance-type non-pecuniary fringe benefit, these moneys must be allocated because the fringe benefit is no longer non-pecuniary and is a benefit or advantage arising out of employment (EIR 36(9); EIR 36(10)). This remains so, even if the claimant uses the money to purchase the insurance coverage the money was intended to cover.When the termination moneys include a payment in lieu of a non-pecuniary fringe benefit, the calculation of normal weekly earnings includes the value of the compensated non-pecuniary fringe benefit.Termination moneys may not include a payment in lieu of non-pecuniary fringe benefits as such, however the employer may base the calculation of the amount of termination moneys on the employee's basic salary, plus the value of the weekly non-pecuniary fringe benefits the employee received when employed. In these situations, normal weekly earnings include both the basic salary and the value of the weekly non-pecuniary fringe benefits.",28.06508296460177,19.871943215339236,19.78447435784618,24.973598820059,24.28006637168141,14.11563421828908,75.1183628318584,13.875,3.897108683239789,0.9114682738603672,0.415921445219595,0.0649139676647925,0.882766170161111,0.881958395242691,5.206489675516224,5.0,2.8250594390143724,42.375,36.5,26.277069376169024,1.6047197640117994,1.0,0.945463393084302,339,145,0.4277286135693215,1811,8,5.12.10,Fringe benefits,Chapter 5 - Earnings
288,288,"Determining whether an award for damages for wrongful dismissal is income arising out of employment uses the same process as any other moneys paid as a result of a termination from employment. Actions lodged for wrongful dismissal may cover a variety of issues ranging from abusive dismissal, failure to give proper notice, libel and defamation, loss of income, loss of status, etc.Damages for wrongful dismissal include any moneys awarded by a court or a tribunal, or agreed upon in an out-of-court settlement, following a dismissal that the employee claims was wrongful. Wrongful can mean either that the employment was terminated without cause or that the amount of notice was insufficient. Without cause simply means the employee was not at fault, or that dismissal was too harsh under the circumstances.An employment contract is not always indefinite; either the employer or the employee can terminate it at any time, sometimes without the other's consent. There is not necessarily any wrongdoing when an employment contract is terminated, unless the employment is protected by legislative or contractual provisions. Termination in these cases is wrong if there is no cause. An employee who is not at fault is entitled to reasonable notice of a lay-off or separation. If sufficient notice is not provided, the employee is entitled to remuneration for the notice period (that is, pay in lieu of notice).An employee who is fired for cause is not entitled to notice or to pay in lieu of notice, although it may be offered. Likewise, pay in lieu of notice is usually not offered when an employee quits. However, if the employee claims that the circumstances forced a resignation, that employee may seek damages. Awards or settlements made in these circumstances are damages for constructive dismissal and are treated in the same manner as damages for wrongful dismissal.When pay in lieu of notice is offered, the employee may accept or reject the offer. If the offer is accepted, that is usually the end of the matter. The principle of received and accepted is covered in section 5.6.1 of this chapter. If the employee refuses the offer, no allocation is made until a settlement is reached and accepted by the claimant.Whether or not remuneration is offered, the employee may decide to challenge the dismissal itself, or the terms of the separation offer, if one was made. An employee who is dismissed is protected only to the extent provided for by federal statute, by the labour legislation of the province where the work is performed, or by a union contract. The employee may file a grievance through a union to try to be reinstated, or consult a lawyer and claim damages for wrongful dismissal through the courts.Whether the case proceeds to court and is settled by a judge, or it is settled out of court, any payment made as a result of that process is generally known as damages for wrongful dismissal. Whether the employee is reinstated or not is only important in determining how the payment will be allocated. The allocation will however, begin with the week of dismissal or termination of employment, regardless of how or when the actual payment is made. The amounts paid to an employee to compensate for lost wages where the employee is not reinstated, do not represent damages and are allocated pursuant to EIR 36(9) and EIR 36(10). Information concerning payments for lost wages  paid to an employee who is reinstated after being wrongfully dismissed is included in another section, as they are payments in exchange for the relinquishment of the right to be reinstated (Digest 5.12.12; Digest 5.12.13).",54.38486919275127,11.705559143327845,13.600736892100487,15.247420098846789,13.608204283360791,11.567182866556834,54.59301482701812,7.36,3.033140249910044,0.6424583709102313,0.4631915386930069,0.0619737745458933,0.8777247741818428,0.876828336197397,4.86161449752883,4.0,2.8436395738590305,24.28,24.0,8.982293693706525,1.5107084019769357,1.0,0.8235419899461899,607,218,0.3591433278418451,3018,25,5.12.11,Damages for wrongful dismissal,Chapter 5 - Earnings
289,289,"The initial position of an employee who is claiming damages for wrongful dismissal through the court system, is outlined in a statement of claim. The statement of claim filed with the Court usually lists the categories for which the employee seeks damages. Often, but not always, the amount of compensation sought for each category of damages is listed. In addition to pay in lieu of notice, dismissed employees may request, in a civil suit, compensation for moving costs; costs to become re-employed, including retraining costs; or loss of company benefits, such as dental plans. The statement of claim may also claim damages for intangibles such as mental distress.After the employee's lawyer sends a statement of claim (the employee's wish list), the parties and their lawyers may meet and negotiate a settlement out-of-court. Out-of-court settlements are common and avoid the risks and trouble of a trial. Once a settlement has been reached out-of-court, letters of understanding, minutes or memorandum of settlement, settlement agreements, or a final release are prepared. Out-of-court settlements are written by lawyers, and not by a judge or arbitrator. The lawyers are free to phrase the terms of the settlement in any manner that benefits their client. The terms of out-of-court settlements may be very specific, or very general. They rarely place blame, nor accept fault on the part of either the employer or the employee, although in some cases they may appear to do so. After both parties have agreed to the terms of the agreement, a final release is usually signed by the employee, along with the settlement agreement, agreeing to the terms of the settlement, and agreeing not to take any future action.If the parties cannot agree on a settlement, a judge or labour arbitration tribunal hears the case. In the court system, it has long been settled that the principal consideration in assessing damages for wrongful dismissal is the notice period given for the dismissal. In other words, it may not be the dismissal itself that is in dispute, but rather the amount of notice given, or payment in lieu of that notice. This principle was confirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada which ruled that damages for wrongful dismissal should usually be restricted to compensating an employee for damages which are tangible and estimable, for example, wages and other employment-related benefits which are lost when the employment ended (S.C.C Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick, 2008). Damages for wrongful dismissal which are awarded by the courts, are therefore usually confined to putting employees in the financial position they would have been in, had they been given reasonable notice.In the courts, damages for intangibles such as loss of prestige, injury to reputation and emotional upset are usually awarded only when damage arises from an injury that is not related solely to the dismissal itself. For example, if mental distress is claimed, the civil court or the labour arbitration tribunal must consider if the actions complained of are independently actionable (that is, could the claimant sue the employer for mental distress if a dismissal did not occur). The Court reasoned that stress is normal in any dismissal and should not normally be compensated for in suits for damages for wrongful dismissal.",57.19712121212122,11.78792207792208,12.45797560212912,14.548917748917749,14.761365367965368,11.903199999999996,53.82683982683983,7.238095238095238,2.9554144316363486,0.6005038916964625,0.4731218518642852,0.0653853570799147,0.8816597044467926,0.8843323368775217,4.903636363636363,4.0,2.636765486615175,26.19047619047619,25.0,10.408874636665294,1.4545454545454546,1.0,0.7414526728764975,550,226,0.4109090909090909,2778,21,5.12.11.1,The legal process and damages,Chapter 5 - Earnings
290,290,"Damages for wrongful dismissal are presumed to be compensation for the loss of income from employment, and are therefore earnings arising out of employment, unless it can reasonably be concluded that the money does not represent lost wages or lost employment-related benefits. Unless there is clear evidence to the contrary, the Commission may presume that awards do not usually contain monetary compensation for intangibles such as loss of prestige, injury to reputation, or emotional upset (CUB 65078; FCA A-231-95, CUB 27115).Any part of an award for damages, which is not related to the direct and tangible advantages received by the claimant during employment, is not earnings. Wages and employment-related benefits such as premiums paid by the employer for insurance-type benefits, can be considered tangible advantages of employment. Therefore, an award to compensate for the loss of those wages or employment-related benefits received during employment, is earnings. An award for an intangible, such as mental distress, is not earnings because compensation for the loss of one's health is not compensation for lost wages, nor is it compensation for loss of an employment-related benefit. An award not related to the advantages of employment is not earnings for benefit purposes (CUB 51759). Payments for medical expenses are never earnings for EI benefit purposes, as they are not meant to compensate the employee for the loss of income from employment. The treatment of expenses, such as legal fees, relocation expenses or retraining expenses, which may form part of an award, is covered in another section (Digest 5.12.2.1; Digest 5.12.11.4).Frequently claimants will allege that a settlement was not for lost wages, or for other advantages related to employment, but to buy peace and avoid a trial, as a compromise to terminate controversy, for damages for a loss of career, or for a change in status (CUB 57295; CUB 47851). These arguments may be unsuccessful for 2 reasons; First, the name given to a payment does not necessarily define its true nature. Second, the onus is on the claimant to show that an award was not intended to compensate for the loss of wages and other employment-related benefits.",41.72909052924794,16.357518105849582,16.404322709996244,20.376713091922007,20.26679665738161,13.02116991643454,67.09777158774374,11.2,3.4909248543080578,0.5968805051034436,0.4842270920302017,0.0556902615405914,0.9085701174206204,0.9098605960607528,5.041782729805014,4.0,2.951027043280911,35.9,27.0,19.490767044936945,1.5208913649025069,1.0,0.7997097571740055,359,151,0.4206128133704735,1865,10,5.12.11.2,Compensation other than for the loss of income from employment,Chapter 5 - Earnings
291,291,"When a case proceeds to court or labour arbitration, and the text of the judgement allocates the amounts awarded to various categories, the judgement can usually be relied upon as an accurate representation of what the award actually represents (CUB 47918). Such clearly worded judgements should not be questioned, even if all or part of the award compensates the claimant for damages unrelated to the loss of wages or employment-related benefits. Any moneys paid for the loss of wages and employment-related benefits are earnings. It should be noted that a Consent Order is not a decision of the court made after a hearing, but rather it is a ruling confirming agreement reached by the 2 parties.Often, the text of the court or labour arbitration judgement is not specific and simply awards a lump sum. In these cases, the Commission may assume that the entire award is earnings arising out of employment, and allocate the entire lump sum , less any applicable expenses incurred to obtain it  (for example, legal expenses) (EIR 35(10)(a)).When the matter does not proceed to a court or labour arbitration tribunal, and an out-of-court settlement is reached, the memorandum of settlement and final release may be very general and assign only a final dollar value for the damages sought. When this is the case, the entire amount of the out-of-court settlement, less any applicable legal expenses, is considered earnings arising out of employment and is allocated.Conversely, the final agreement may contain very specific details. Memorandums of settlement are written by lawyers, whose job is to respond to the needs of their clients. To benefit their clients they may indicate in the documents that all or most of the money paid by the employer is for reasons other than the loss of income from employment. Keeping in mind that the courts usually restrict themselves to awarding damages for tangibles related to benefits received during employment, any out-of-court settlement that claims that very little or no amount is to compensate for lost employment income, must be carefully examined.It is not enough for a claimant to allege that an out-of-court settlement is not compensation for the loss of wages or other employment-related benefits. Jurisprudence has long held that the onus is on the claimant to show that the money was paid for other reasons, such as unpaid wages, moving expenses, retraining expenses, or for the relinquishment of the right to be reinstated (FCA A-140-03, CUB 56407). Claims or allegations made in a Statement of Claim are not considered proof that the employer has agreed to compensate the claimant for anything other than loss of wages.To exclude money from the category of earnings paid to compensate for the loss of employment income, the claimant must establish that the payment was requested for other reasons, and that the employer agreed to compensate the claimant for those reasons (for example, injury, damage or expenses). Proof may be included in the final release or in correspondence between lawyers (CUB 78803). In addition, the claimant must show that the injury, damage or expenses claimed actually occurred, and that the payment and the amount were reasonable in light of the injury, damage or expenses. For example, if mental distress is claimed, the Commission may reasonably expect that the claimant sought professional help to deal with the distress. If this were not done, the claimant's allegation would be less credible. Receipts for expenses, which the employer agreed to pay for in the wrongful dismissal suit, are adequate proof that the money was paid to compensate for something other than the loss of employment income and benefits.The employer must also confirm that the payment was not fully or partly for lost employment income. A straightforward, clear and uncontradicted statement is acceptable unless the employer's confirmation appears to arise out of collusion with the employee, and the intent is to circumvent the EI Act. Likewise, if the employer's statement appears to be motivated by a desire to accommodate the employee, the out-of-court settlement should be examined carefully.It is rare that any portion of an out-of-court settlement is not considered earnings when it is written in very general terms. This only happens when the evidence clearly demonstrates that the settlement is not solely for lost employment-related income (CUB 51759).",53.91416065573773,13.01335300546448,13.475323542916517,16.19287431693989,16.4447131147541,12.195464480874318,57.96852459016394,8.4,3.2070309377448085,0.7178103771009785,0.4683908920956994,0.0764899760223577,0.8900774866342545,0.8778887961221777,4.933060109289618,4.0,2.7727498989002517,29.28,29.0,14.443046769985894,1.4562841530054644,1.0,0.7462118292552441,732,260,0.3551912568306011,3711,25,5.12.11.3,The EI process and damages,Chapter 5 - Earnings
292,292,"The claimant may be awarded an amount of money to reimburse the cost of taking legal action to obtain termination moneys, or to become reinstated. Legal costs or expenses include lawyer's fees, as well as court costs, disbursements and other legitimate expenses directly related to the legal action. As long as the claimant actually incurred expenses in connection with the action taken against the employer, that portion of a payment is not considered earnings for the purposes of EI benefits. This is because the amount paid specifically to reimburse legal expenses is not intended to cover lost wages or employment-related benefits.Sometimes the amount awarded may not be sufficient to cover actual legal costs, or no special amount is awarded. If the claimant provides proof that the legal costs exceeded the amount awarded for legal costs, or no amount was awarded for the entire amount of the legal costs, those costs are deducted from the settlement. This is because they were incurred for the direct purpose of receiving that income (EIR 35(10)(a); Digest 5.3.3.2). However, if a settlement includes both income replacement and sums not considered earnings for EI purposes, only the amount of the legal fees incurred to recover the income replacement portion of the settlement can be deducted. This amount is obtained by using the percentage that the income replacement portion is, of the total award amount received. This may be adjusted if the claimant can establish that the amount paid to recover the income replacement portion was higher than the calculated proportional amount (CUB 34664).The claimant cannot include the value of their own time or personal expenses, expended to resolve a wrongful dismissal suit (CUB 72033). Costs related to other legal matters such as pursuing an appeal to the Board of Referees are not valid deductions (CUB 41768).",50.719927992799285,13.027974797479754,13.747043046817236,16.034683468346838,16.172529252925294,12.874719471947197,57.57845784578458,8.272727272727273,3.328232939354771,0.671113715203501,0.4757891977991954,0.049610285885603,0.8693015336990356,0.8556215431955125,5.05940594059406,5.0,2.6092819169919044,27.545454545454547,23.0,9.423024378072682,1.5148514851485149,1.0,0.7349887592971568,303,134,0.4422442244224422,1567,11,5.12.11.4,Legal costs,Chapter 5 - Earnings
293,293,"When an employee's actions involve actual or alleged misconduct, the employer has several options to address it, up to and including dismissal. Sometimes the employee may be:fired immediatelysuspended with pay pending, an investigation, and later firedsuspended without pay, and later firedsuspended initially with full pay or reduced pay, later without pay, and later fired, orsuspended as a disciplinary measure, then return to workIn short, the employer's options are many and varied. The employee also has several options that may include grieving the action, or starting an action for wrongful dismissal. Any earnings paid in relation to the suspension or dismissal would be allocated and could affect a claim for benefits.Earnings paid or payable by reason of a lay-off or separation must be allocated from the date of the event that gave right to the money. When an employee is suspended or on a leave of absence without pay and is later fired or resigns, the termination of employment is related to the initial suspension or leave of absence (CUB 30296). Any earnings received during the period of suspension or leave of absence, such as vacation pay paid or payable by reason of the suspension or leave of absence, must be allocated from the date of separation in a way that does not exceed the claimant's normal weekly earnings (EIR 36(10)).In some cases, when an employee has been suspended or fired, the employer and the employee may come to an agreement, or have a decision settled upon them, that the duration of the suspension or the dismissal was too severe a penalty in the circumstances. As a result, the period of suspension may be shortened, or the employee may be reinstated. If the employer then pays the employee an amount to cover lost wages for the period following the amended suspension period, these earnings are allocated to the period immediately following the period during which the claimant was actually suspended and not from the date of the original suspension (EIR 36(11)).

294,294,"An employee may file a grievance or complaint relating to a dismissal without just or sufficient cause, a prohibited practice, or for psychological harassment under federal or provincial labour standards laws. Following an award resulting from this grievance, the employee may receive an amount as compensation for relinquishing their right to reinstatement, in compliance with an order by the relevant authority (FCA A-140-03, CUB 56407). A reinstatement can also be ordered within the framework of a complaint filed under other legislations governing human rights, occupational health and safety, victim-related legislations or electoral laws.In some cases, reinstatement may not be the most appropriate measure and another form of redress should be considered. In such situations, an agreement or settlement may be reached between the parties in which the employer offers to compensate the employee for relinquishing their reinstatement rights.In order for an employee to be able to receive compensation for relinquishing their right to recall, it is essential that a right to reinstatement exist in the first place, be it under federal, provincial or territorial legislation, or under a contract or collective agreement.  It must also be clearly established that the moneys were paid in compensation for the relinquishment of that right.If the employee does not have the right to ask for reinstatement under legislation or a collective agreement, but pursues wrongful dismissal action through the courts, any amounts granted by the Court constitute damages for wrongful dismissal, and not for the relinquishment of the right to be reinstated (Digest 5.12.11). A court does not have the authority to issue a reinstatement order where there is no right to reinstatement under federal, provincial or territorial legislation, or under a contract or collective agreement.Moneys paid to an employee pursuant to legislation or a collective agreement, for the relinquishment of reinstatement rights do not constitute earnings for EI benefit purposes. It is not necessary to know whether it was the employee or the employer who initiated the relinquishment of the reinstatement rights.Unlike moneys paid in compensation for wrongful dismissal, which are paid to cover the period the individual would have worked had they not been dismissed, moneys paid for the express purpose of the relinquishment of reinstatement rights are excluded from earnings. This is because these moneys were not earned by labour or given in return for work done.To establish that the moneys were paid in exchange for the relinquishment of reinstatement rights, the claimant must provide an explanation and proof that the following 3 criteria were met:1. The right to reinstatement existedThe right to reinstatement must exist under the federal legislation, under provincial or territorial legislation, or under the clauses of the claimant's work contract or collective agreement.The right to reinstatement can also include any other employment protection measure, such as separate and negotiable bumping or call-back rights, which an employer must uphold under a collective agreement.However, when an agreement between the parties provides for compensation in exchange for the relinquishment of reinstatement rights, it is the very existence of the right to reinstatement, and not the wording of the agreement, that determines whether the moneys can be excluded as earnings. If the right does not exist, the claimant cannot be compensated for relinquishing it.2. The employee sought reinstatementThe employee must have sought reinstatement either through a grievance or an application submitted under legislation. The grievance filed, the application submitted under legislation, or the correspondence between the parties must indicate that the employee was seeking reinstatement. The wording of a grievance is generally clear about whether the employee was seeking to be reinstated.The situation is sometimes less clear in cases relating to labour standards legislation. In Quebec for example, complaint forms for recourse against dismissal without good and sufficient cause, prohibited practice, and psychological harassment, do not mention whether the employee requested reinstatement. However, such a request is implicit with the filing of a complaint because the relevant sections of the labour standards legislation seek the employee's reintegration.3. The moneys were paid to compensate the relinquishment of the right to reinstatementThe fact that the parties have given a label to the damages is not enough; there must be conclusive proof. In all situations where a claimant obtained an agreed settlement, a copy of the agreement between the parties must be provided. This settlement agreement must support the allegation that the right to reinstatement exists, that reinstatement was sought, that the right was relinquished, and that the moneys paid by the employer were compensation for the relinquishment of reinstatement rights. In some cases, additional supporting documents, as well as the correspondence between the parties, could be required to substantiate the allegation.When the result of a negotiation or mediation process is that an employee relinquishes, rather than claims their reinstatement rights before being reinstated, and the amount paid is based on the relinquishment of that right, the wording of the settlement agreement or of the supporting documents, must support the allegation that:the right to reinstatement existsreintegration was soughtthat right was relinquished, andthe moneys paid by the employer were compensation for the relinquishment of the reinstatement rightsIn fact, it must be clearly demonstrated that the moneys were paid in compensation for the relinquishment of reinstatement rights, and that the employer had no choice but to place a monetary value on that right.Any compensation received as part of an agreement when no right to reinstatement exists will be considered as compensation for loss of wages, and will be allocated in the same way as earnings received upon separation from employment (EIR 35; EIR 36).  However, if the claimant proves that part or all of the compensation was paid because of special circumstances, such as the reimbursement of professional or legal fees, relocation costs, retraining or job search costs, or damages for pain and suffering, those amounts will not be allocated (FCA A-567-99, CUB 42598A). If the right to reinstatement does not exist or if the employee has not acquired reinstatement rights, the employee cannot be compensated for relinquishing rights they do not have.",35.15756222345132,16.25090185594887,17.339376936956576,20.500110619469027,20.0900645280236,15.264621435594886,64.81959808259586,10.5,3.2100384435541187,0.6522315019340383,0.4794071413495925,0.0701219101593653,0.8934965056757773,0.885758250951767,5.44149459193707,4.0,3.3997467845179257,31.78125,29.5,17.43870403549243,1.647984267453294,1.0,1.0247566647622786,1017,301,0.295968534906588,5644,32,5.12.13,Moneys paid for the relinquishment of reinstatement rights,Chapter 5 - Earnings
295,295,"Pension moneys arising out of any employment, are earnings for benefit purposes. This is true whether these pension moneys are paid or payable on a periodic basis, or in a lump sum (EIR 35(2)(e); Digest 5.13.3). The very nature of pensions and the fact that they are usually payable when employment is permanently terminated, results in 2 special provisions in their handling. Pension earnings do not prevent an interruption of earnings from occurring, and may be allocated concurrently with other earnings (EIR 35(5); EIR 36(16)). Conversely, pension earnings are not taken into account when allocating other earnings to weeks for which pension moneys are payable.Once payments under a pension plan are paid or payable to the claimant, they must be allocated, regardless of what the claimant does with them. Pension earnings are allocated and may prevent the payment of EI benefits, even if they are transferred to a RRSP at the claimant's request. Whether the RRSP is locked-in and non-commutable is not relevant. However, locked-in pension credits that are directly transferred to another locked-in vehicle are not considered paid or payable until they are withdrawn from these locked-in vehicles (Digest 5.13.2; Digest 5.13.7). Locked-in pension credits are the moneys in a pension fund that support a member's pension entitlement under the plan. For defined contribution pension plans, these credits are the contributions made to the pension fund, plus accumulated interest. For defined benefit pension plans, these credits are the commuted value of the pension to be paid. In most cases, locked-in pension credits cannot be refunded in cash on termination of employment; they can only be paid as a pension benefit.Pensions are allocated to the period for which they are paid or payable, regardless of the method of payment, or when the payment is made. The manner of allocating pension moneys depends on whether a pension is paid on a periodic basis, or in a lump sum in lieu of a pension (EIR 36(14); EIR 36(15); EIR 36(17)).Pensions are not considered earnings if, after the date the pension became payable, the claimant has accumulated a sufficient number of hours of insurable employment that would allow them to establish a benefit period (Digest 5.13.13). The benefit period during which the pension is to be exempted must be based on insured hours that include these hours.Although not pension earnings, refunds of the employer or employee contributions into a pension fund and the accumulated interest are earnings arising out of employment (EIR 35(2)). The method for allocating these earnings varies according to the type of contributions being returned. A refund of the employee contributions on termination is allocated back to the period of employment (EIR 36(4); Digest 5.13.8.1). These moneys would have formed part of the claimant's gross weekly earnings during the period of employment and therefore would have no effect on the payment of EI benefits. A refund of the employer contributions is allocated as earnings paid or payable by reason of separation (that is, starting from the week of separation, at normal weekly earnings) (EIR 36(9); Digest 5.13.8.2).",54.2450514800515,11.821119691119694,12.785403640627711,14.499871299871302,14.44424066924067,12.388648648648644,56.71299871299871,7.904761904761905,3.3312479858622357,0.9015040901518048,0.4515885534942837,0.0679427787822175,0.8370053023099899,0.8708796501159668,4.998069498069498,4.0,2.745652256162884,24.666666666666668,24.0,11.222143642660608,1.5077220077220077,1.0,0.787779627340738,518,183,0.3532818532818533,2677,21,5.13.0,Moneys arising out of a pension fund,Chapter 5 - Earnings
296,296,"A pension plan is a formal agreement, contract, or arrangement entered into by the employer with employees, for the purpose of providing retirement benefits. Pension plans may also pay other moneys on termination of employment, but prior to retirement. In order to determine the nature of these moneys (that is, whether these moneys are earnings) and how to properly allocate them, it is essential to have an understanding of the basic provisions of pension plans and the relevant legislation under which these plans are registered and operate  (Digest 5.13.1.2; Digest 5.13.1.3; Digest 5.13.1.1). An explanation of some of the common terms used in pension plans and legislation is contained in section 5.13.2 of this chapter.",44.66551724137932,14.233793103448274,15.247664890283003,17.80689655172414,17.2696551724138,13.390344827586208,60.896551724137936,9.25,2.835388027493606,0.4366077677280933,0.4980575790098648,0.0671023213993773,0.8718275030454,0.836491048336029,5.137931034482759,5.0,2.8674647931703263,29.0,23.0,15.3785564992297,1.5689655172413792,1.0,0.8532305539074914,116,76,0.6551724137931034,611,4,5.13.1,Pension plan structure and legislation,Chapter 5 - Earnings
297,297,"Pension plans must be registered under provincial or federal pension legislation, as well as with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), for the purposes of the Income Tax Act. Any provisions in the pension plan must comply with not only any applicable pension legislation, but also with the conditions and limitations on pension benefits, imposed by CRA through the Income Tax Act. In general, the pension legislation sets the minimum provisions a plan must contain, and the Income Tax Act sets the maximum. During the entire time the pension fund is in operation, the authorities who administer this legislation control what may go into the plan, what may come out, how it may come out, and what happens while the moneys are in the plan.Pension plans that cover all federal government employees, employees of the Canadian Armed Forces, the RCMP, and members of parliament, are established by separate federal legislation. The legislation setting up these pension plans is subject to the Income Tax Act and must meet all the income tax provisions. However, it is not subject to the federal or provincial pension legislation regarding provisions related to vesting and lock in.All provinces, except Prince Edward Island, have pension legislation that sets out the provisions that must be contained in each province's registered pension plan. The Pension Benefits Standards Act of the Government of Canada applies to the employees of any province who are under federal jurisdiction. This includes employees of Crown corporations, banks, railways, airlines, shipping companies, radio stations, communication companies, and employees of the Canadian territories. The applicable provincial legislation is determined by the location of the employee's work site. The provisions required by the federal or provincial legislation are the minimum that must be met; however, any plan can offer more generous terms within the limits set by CRA. In addition, plans for an employer whose operations span several provinces must meet the conditions set out in each of those provincial acts. An employer may achieve this by adopting the provisions of the most generous provincial legislation, or they may have separate sections in the plan containing the provisions for employees in each province. It is important that the particular provisions of the employer's pension plan are known, so that the true nature of the moneys, and the conditions under which they are being paid, can be determined.In addition to defining the benefits that are payable on retirement, every pension plan must also define when pensions are payable, and the benefits and rights of the employees upon termination of their services. These rights may include having the locked-in pension credits transferred to a locked-in vehicle, having the right to a refund of their own contributions, a refund of their own and their employer's contributions, or a deferred annuity.Some provincial legislation, as well as federal legislation, periodically undergo changes. Contributions made prior to the effective date of any changes in legislation may have one set of rules regarding when contributions are vested and locked in, and contributions made on or after the date of changes may have a different set of rules. The relevant dates and their provisions can be found in the pension plan itself.",42.488814727955,13.953593808630394,16.58743788028819,18.990206378986866,16.14310506566604,13.360825515947464,58.92016885553471,8.6,2.999261908864621,0.8395875416723512,0.479127098435662,0.0588936227290259,0.8704555881650824,0.8669638633728027,5.1482176360225145,4.0,2.869026809640455,26.65,25.0,8.895363961075454,1.622889305816135,1.0,0.9462087383287908,533,199,0.373358348968105,2815,20,5.13.1.1,Pension plan legislation,Chapter 5 - Earnings
298,298,"Pension plans are as varied as the needs of the individuals they cover. However, generally, all pension plans share the same purpose and have some similar provisions regarding the payment of benefits. The similarities arise from the fact that the plans must meet the demands of diverse legislation; the Income Tax Act and the applicable federal or provincial pension legislation. However, retirement plans may exist which are not registered under the Income Tax Act. As no income tax deduction is possible for any contributions made to such a plan, these plans are not very common (Digest 5.13.10).Pension plans may have various requirements for the employer and employees depending on the type of plan. A contributory plan requires employees to contribute, and the employer to pay the balance of the costs. In a non-contributory plan, the employer pays the full cost. If required, contributions made by the employee are collected by the employer, usually by way of a payroll deduction from the employee's gross pay, and placed in the pension fund. The employer's contributions go directly into the fund. The employer contributions do not form part of the employee's gross earnings, and are not included for the purposes of calculating income tax, EI premiums, and CPP contributions. While in the pension fund, both employer and employee contributions accumulate interest.The purpose of a pension plan is to provide a pension benefit upon retirement. Retirement may be at an early retirement age or at normal retirement age; however it is important to note that receiving a pension from an employment does not necessarily mean that the individual is retiring from all employment (Digest 5.13.5.1). Contributing to a pension plan does not necessarily guarantee a pension, as not all employees remain employed by the same employer until retirement age. Some employees may work for an employer and contribute to the plan for a short time. The benefits, if any, that are payable to an employee who leaves employment prior to retirement age, depend on whether vesting and lock-in of the pension contributions have occurred.Vesting is the employee's right to receive some sort of benefit under the pension plan (Digest 5.13.2). Normally, this vested benefit takes the form of either a return of the contributions made to the plan and the accumulated interest, or a deferred pension (an annuity). Whether contributions are vested under the terms of a pension plan depends on the length of employment with that employer. The type of benefit or the nature of the benefit that the employee receives, a refund of contributions or a deferred pension, depends on whether lock-in has occurred.The locking in of contributions simply means that they can no longer be refunded in a lump sum, as a return of contributions. As such, the only benefit that can be paid by the pension fund, based on those contributions, is an immediate or deferred pension. Furthermore, that pension can only be paid upon reaching a specified retirement age. The locking in of contributions, like vesting, depends on the length of time employed, and is set out in the provisions of the plan. While vesting establishes the right to a benefit under the plan, locking in restricts access to that benefit until the specified retirement age is reached. Vesting usually occurs at the same time as lock-in, although it can occur earlier. The actual pension plan will describe at what point vesting and lock-in occur.Return of contributions, whether the employer's or employee's, can only occur when these contributions are not locked in. In addition, to be refunded, the employee must have a vested right to these contributions. Under all pension plans, vesting occurs immediately for the employee's own contributions. This means, no matter how long the employee has been employed, as long as these contributions are not locked in, they can receive all of their own contributions and the accumulated interest, upon termination of employment. If these contributions are locked in, they cannot be refunded as they will be used to support the payment of a pension at retirement age. If the pension plan permits vesting to occur earlier than lock-in, the employee may be entitled to a lump-sum payment of the employer contributions and the accumulated interest, as well as to the return of their own contributions.The provisions of a particular pension plan may allow vesting of the employer's portion of the pension contributions to be contingent on certain factors (conditional). This means that full benefits from both the employer's and employee's contributions are only paid if a certain option is chosen (the deferred pension). Contingent vesting therefore prevents the immediate payment of the employer contributions.The term pension credits refers to contributions and the accumulated interest that are locked in and can no longer be refunded in cash, on termination of employment. Therefore, a benefit from these pension credits can only be paid as a pension. However, this does not mean that these pension credits have to remain with that employer's pension plan until the employee reaches retirement age. Pension plans allow for some degree of portability (transferability) of pension credits (Digest 5.13.2; Digest 5.13.7). The condition on the transfer of these credits is that they must move directly from one locked-in vehicle to another, and must remain locked in until retirement age is reached. As long as these conditions are met, a transfer may be made. Eligible locked-in vehicles can be another employer's pension plan (if the other plan so permits); a locked-in non-commutable RRSP, or its equivalent (provincial locked-in retirement account (LIRA) or Quebec's compte de retraite immobilisÃ© (CRI)); or an annuity purchase contract.Upon reaching either normal retirement age or an early retirement age, as set out in the plan, employees may access their locked-in pension credits as a pension. Pension plans require that employees apply for their pension, as it is not paid automatically upon reaching retirement age. Employees can delay the start of their pensions to a time of their choosing, however, it cannot begin later than the maximum age allowed by legislation. This also applies to locked-in vehicles. Whether a pension is paid periodically as an annuity, or as a lump-sum pension payment, depends on the provisions of the pension plan (Digest 5.13.6).",51.65202261058454,11.515145142180092,13.88009791879805,15.237164296998422,12.917611769352291,12.013611374407578,52.974427330173775,6.8125,3.1333704192200558,0.7187067523514223,0.4276559678992748,0.0606537239659902,0.8456182625699551,0.8295172524193059,4.959241706161137,4.0,2.9180346878007577,21.979166666666668,23.0,8.865874612179494,1.5706161137440755,1.0,0.8893733346917516,1055,281,0.2663507109004739,5407,48,5.13.1.2,Pension plan structure,Chapter 5 - Earnings
299,299,"There are 6 types of pension plans that in turn, can be classified into 3 broad categories. These categories depend on whether the pension is defined on the basis of a set formula (that is, a defined benefit), a set level of contributions (that is, a defined contribution), or a combination of the 2 (that is, a hybrid or combination).Defined Benefit Pension Plans specify the formula for calculating the pension that will be paid to the employee on retirement. Contribution rates are then established during the years employed to provide for a sum of money on retirement that will be able to support the payment of that pension. Any shortfalls, between what the accumulated contributions would support as a pension and the pension to which that employee is entitled, must be made up by the employer. There are 3 types of defined benefit pension plans:Final Earnings Pension Planthe pension is based on the member's length of service and average earnings for a stated period before retirement, for example: 2% multiplied by the number of years of service multiplied by an average of the member's earnings during the last or best five consecutive years of service.Career Average Earnings Pension Planthe pension is equal to a percentage of the aggregate earnings in the member's entire career. For example: 2% of the aggregate earnings during the employee's period of serviceFlat (or Uniform) Benefit Pension Planthe pension is based on a specified number of dollars for each year of service. For example: $40 per month for each year of service would yield a pension of $1200 per month for someone with 30 years of serviceDefined Contribution Pension Plans specify the contribution rate. Whatever money is in the fund on retirement will be used to purchase an annuity. There are 2 types of defined contribution pension plans:Money Purchase (Defined Contribution) Pension Planthe contribution amount is specified, however the pension amount is not known until the employee retires. For example: 5% of the employee's salary per year from both the employer and the employee, reduced by the required contributions under CPP and QPP. The amount of pension that these contributions will be able to purchase as an annuity will not be known until the employee retiresProfit Sharing Pension Plan\t\t\t\t\tthe employer contributes an amount that varies each year with the profits earned.\t\t\t\t\tIt is allocated to each member on a point system. Taxation authorities require that the employer make a minimum contribution, equal to at least 1% of remuneration of plan members in any year. The amount of pension that these contributions will provide will not be known until the employee retiresHybrid or Combination Plans include characteristics of both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. In combination plans, the pension is the sum of 2 types of benefits; in hybrid plans, the pension is the greater of 2 types of benefits.",44.5815467224547,14.95766527196653,15.381575749822971,18.520725244072526,18.10260111576012,12.732635983263595,64.29344490934449,10.333333333333334,3.265346964885698,0.7763027588977789,0.5141731122299551,0.0488292423650691,0.8191305186067309,0.8146552581053513,5.010460251046025,4.0,3.1078749008040263,31.866666666666667,29.0,13.588557277683634,1.5355648535564854,1.0,0.8737159107261014,478,159,0.3326359832635983,2454,15,5.13.1.3,Categories of pension plans,Chapter 5 - Earnings
300,300,"An explanation of some of the specialized terms contained in pension plans and pension legislation follows in alphabetical order:ActuaryAn actuary is a business professional who computes insurance and pension rates and premiums on the basis of experience tables, by using probability, risk theory, and statistics (Black's Law Dictionary).AnnuityAn annuity is a fixed sum payable to a person at specified intervals for a specific period of time or for life. Each payment represents a partial return of the capital invested and a return on the capital investment (commonly called interest).Commuted valueTo commute something in a financial sense is to convert it to cash. The commuted value of a pension represents the cash equivalent of what that pension would have been, if paid in a lump-sum payment. It is the value of the monthly pension payments to be made in the future, converted into a fixed or gross amount (a cash lump-sum settlement) (Digest 5.13.6.2).Locked inLocked in means that the contributions to the plan cannot be withdrawn by the employee, and the employee can only receive the benefit of those contributions in the form of a pension, at retirement. The employer and the employee portion of the pension fund contributions must stay in the fund, and cannot be refunded. Although they can't be refunded, they may be transferred to another locked-in vehicle. Locked-in pension contributions may also be referred to as pension credits.Through vesting, an employee establishes a right to receipt of the contributions. The lock-in provisions limit what the employee can do with the contributions to which they have a vested right; that is, they cannot receive them in cash until retirement age is reached. There are exceptions to the locking-in rule, and if the terms of the particular plan permit, the employee may receive a cash sum. These exceptions occur when the periodic pension amount that the employee is entitled to is below a set limit, when there is a shorter than normal life expectancy, when partial commutation is allowed by legislation, when Additional Voluntary Contributions are returned (Digest 5.13.9.1), or when provisions exist regarding Maximum Funding by Employee Contributions (Digest 5.13.8.1).When identifying moneys paid out of a pension fund, any payout of pension moneys prior to lock-in is normally a return of contributions, whereas any payment after lock-in has occurred is generally a lump-sum pension benefit.Locked-in, non-commutable RRSPA locked-in, non-commutable RRSP, or its equivalent (LIRA, CRI), is a financial vehicle that can be likened to a portable pension plan. A non-commutable RRSP is one that can never be de-registered. The full value of the RRSP cannot be obtained in a lump sum, which is why it is said to be non-commutable. These types of RRSPs can only be used to purchase an annuity. An RRSP will be recognized as both locked-in and non-commutable when the RRSP agreement is accompanied by an additional guarantee: both the claimant and the financial institution guarantee that the funds in the RRSP will never be used for any purpose other than to purchase a monthly annuity at retirement age. Additional information regarding the consequences these RRSPs have on whether they are considered payable for the purposes of EI benefits, is available in section 5.13.7 of this chapter.Such a locked-in, non-commutable RRSP is distinguishable from a personal, collapsible RRSP used as an individual investment tool. Personal RRSPs may or may not require the funds to be locked-in for a specific term, in order for the individual to gain a specific rate of return or growth for the investment. As the entire amount of personal RRSP funds belongs to the claimant, they may receive them at any time by collapsing the RRSP and converting it into cash, even if a penalty may be assessed by the financial institution for doing so before the end of the specified term.Locked-in vehicleA locked-in vehicle is a financial instrument designed so that moneys contained within it can only be used to pay a pension on retirement. The locked-in vehicles from which most provincial pension legislation allow the transfer of pension credits (locked-in contributions) are:another employer's Registered Pension Plan (RPP), if there is a provision for this transfer in the other employer's pension plana prescribed RRSP that is both locked-in and non-commutable, or its equivalent, such as a LIRA, or CRI which have all the same provisions, andan annuity purchase contractPortabilityPortability means that the commuted value of a terminating employee's pension may be transferred to another locked-in vehicle. Most pension plans give a terminating employee the right to have the commuted value of the vested pension transferred to a locked-in vehicle.VestingVesting is the right of an employee to a benefit from the pension plan, on termination of employment. Vesting allows the employee to retain a pension (or the value thereof), even if the employee leaves the plan before a pension benefit is immediately payable. The length of time an employee must be employed before vesting is allowed is set out in the pension legislation and the pension plan. Normally, this vested benefit takes the form of either a return of contributions made to the plan and any accumulated interest, or a deferred pension. What the employee receives on termination of employment depends on whether the contributions are locked in. According to pension legislation, vesting normally occurs at the same time as lock-in, however, individual pension plans may provide vesting at an earlier date.If the contributions have become locked in by the terms of the pension plan or pension legislation, the employer and employee contributions cannot be refunded. They must remain with the fund to support the payment of the deferred pension that the employee has a vested right to receive at retirement age. If the contributions have not become locked in, they are refunded to the employee on termination of employment.The contributions that may be refundable to an employee on termination depends on whether they were made by the employer or the employee, and the provisions of the pension plan. Employees always have a right to a return of their own contributions, no matter how long they were employed with that particular employer. Therefore, vesting is always immediate for employee contributions. However, whether there is a right to the employer contributions on leaving employment depends on the terms of the pension plan and the employee's length of employment with that employer. If the pension plan allows vesting to occur prior to lock-in, and the employee was employed the required length of time, the employer contributions are refunded.The provisions of a particular pension plan may allow conditional vesting of the employer's portion of the pension contributions. This means that full benefits from the contributions (that is, the receipt of both employer and employee contributions) occurs only if a certain option is chosen (usually the deferred pension). The plan will indicate whether vesting is conditional or not.",44.11351694915257,14.435,15.6451,18.308474576271188,16.686389830508475,12.367389830508472,60.51694915254237,9.15,3.1855183103930416,0.8603872958623741,0.4315789596296274,0.0711669736903314,0.8852500304197654,0.8718094919857226,4.961016949152542,4.0,3.100602289722879,29.5,25.0,19.019726601610238,1.5694915254237287,1.0,0.9411954600379128,1180,320,0.2711864406779661,6016,40,5.13.2,Pension plan terminology,Chapter 5 - Earnings
301,301,"A definite link exists between payments to a claimant as a pension, and the employment that gave rise to those payments. It is because of the work that was performed for that employer by the claimant, that the pension payments are being made. That link between pensions and employment is sufficient to support a finding that these payments are earnings pursuant to EIR 35(2)(e). This express provision makes pension income arising out of employment, earnings for benefit purposes (FCA A-178-86).Only those pensions that consist of contributions resulting from employment, and made by the employer, the employee, or a combination of the employer and the employee, are earnings for benefit purposes. Pension payments are earnings whether they are based on employment within Canada, foreign employment, insurable employment, or non-insurable employment (EIR 35(1) - definition of employment). This applies whether the pension plan is registered or non-registered, as long as the pension benefits arise from employment (Digest 5.13.10).Included in consideration of pension income are pensions that arise from service in any armed forces, or a police force (EIR 35(1) - definition of pension). Also included are pensions paid or payable under the Canada Pension Plan or a provincial pension plan. A pension from a provincial government pension plan is considered earnings for EI purposes, provided that the payment of the pension is based on employment contributions and the attainment of a specific age, or is based on a specific age and years of service formula.Annuities paid pursuant to the Government Annuities Act are considered pension earnings if they are under a group pension certificate as part of an employer's pension plan. A group annuity can be distinguished from an individual annuity by examining the annuity cheque/deposit stub. If the contract is only 6 digits, it is an individually purchased annuity and is exempt from consideration as earnings. If the contract is ten digits (4 then 6), then it is a group annuity arising from employment and will be considered as earnings.Pension bridging benefits, whether paid from the pension fund or out of general company revenues, are considered a retirement pension arising out of employment, paid on a periodic basis in lieu of a pension (Digest 5.12.7; Digest 5.13.5.2).Group RRSPs are not pension plans for EI purposes, and any moneys arising out of them are considered earned during the period worked. They are simply a collection of individual RRSPs, where the funds are not required by legislation, to be locked-in until retirement, in the same way as pension plans. The ownership of individual accounts is fully and immediately vested in the employees; the employer is only acting as an agent for the employee in the Group RRSPs, when making the deductions and remitting them to the claimant's individual RRSP. Group RRSP monies are considered savings when they are withdrawn from the RRSP. These moneys formed part of the gross earnings during the period the claimant was employed.Disability pensions are specifically excluded from consideration as earnings (EIR 35(7)(a); Digest 5.13.14). In addition, the following pensions are not earnings, as they do not meet the definition of pensions arising out of one's employment (EIR 35(1)):survivors' or dependants' pensionsold age security pensions and supplementspensions or part of pensions that arise from a divorce settlement, or from spousal assignment of a Canada Pension Plan or Quebec Pension Plan pension (Digest 5.13.12)allowances paid to veterans under War Veterans Allowance Actmoneys paid for disability under the Veteran's Affairs Charterindividually purchased RRSPs, which do not result from the transfer of locked-in pension credits from a pension plan (Digest 5.13.2)privately purchased pension plans or annuities, andadditional voluntary contributions (AVCs) (Digest 5.13.9.1)",39.07629584670079,15.74558571056967,16.235038790447152,19.368733200381516,19.5059082632446,14.43650741350906,68.35593514263418,11.63157894736842,3.339798786026462,0.7888223804010287,0.4869082379511433,0.0520113344633721,0.84370290239652,0.8512506730416242,5.299835255354201,4.0,3.118058678638972,31.94736842105263,24.0,21.595500711248377,1.599670510708402,1.0,0.8908466754609375,607,214,0.3525535420098847,3307,19,5.13.3,Determination,Chapter 5 - Earnings
302,302,"It is critical to determine at what point pension moneys actually become paid or payable. The best sources of information to do so are the pension plan, the pension legislation, or information provided by the employer regarding the claimant's entitlement and any payments due or made. There are only certain types of moneys that can arise out of a pension fund, and there are limited ways in which they can be handled. These moneys become paid or payable based on specific terms of the pension plan itself.The treatment of moneys actually received by the claimant is straightforward as these moneys are clearly paid. Examination of the terms of the plan will confirm the nature of the moneys received, before they are allocated against an EI claim. However, a closer look is required when the claimant has a legal right to receive moneys immediately, but chooses to defer the payment of these moneys to a later date.For EI purposes, payable means that there is a legal entitlement to the moneys and they are immediately due (Digest 5.6.1). The due date is not open to speculation but is specified in the terms and conditions of the pension plan itself. The plan sets the normal retirement age, early retirement age, and any moneys due on termination, if a pension is not immediately payable. The plan also covers any allowable transfer actions, with respect to the locked-in pension credits in the plan at the time of termination.Although the claimant may have reached the normal retirement age or an early retirement age as stated in the plan, the plan may make provisions for pension payments to be deferred until the claimant actually applies for it. If the claimant has that choice under the plan and exercises it, these moneys cannot be considered payable (that is, immediately due) until the claimant applies for the pension to be effective a certain date. For example, a claimant retires early at 55 and, according to the provisions of the plan, defers the payment of the pension until age 57. Based on the provisions of the pension plan, the pension is not immediately due until the claimant requests that it start; it is only considered payable at age 57.",62.31857575757577,10.761272727272727,11.979248473330829,13.82360071301248,13.138404634581107,10.604812834224596,51.67130124777184,6.666666666666667,3.033307971784002,0.5026395633260187,0.4600671947356136,0.0472470176057388,0.8816724377019065,0.8876304626464844,4.692513368983957,4.0,2.631381490640708,24.933333333333334,24.0,6.697926710723418,1.4090909090909092,1.0,0.7746123593408245,374,140,0.374331550802139,1796,15,5.13.4,Moneys arising out of a pension fund - Paid or payable,Chapter 5 - Earnings
303,303,"The primary purpose of a pension plan is to provide income support to retired employees in the form of a pension benefit, for the lifetime of the plan member. This does not necessarily mean that the employee is retired from the labour force, but rather, only from that particular employment. Pension legislation defines a pension benefit as an annual, monthly, or other periodic amount to which an employee is, or will be, entitled upon retirement. This periodic payment is commonly called an annuity. Pension benefits, as conceived by pension legislation and the pension plans themselves, are in the form of an annuity payable on retirement, for the life of the employee. However, there are some restricted circumstances where a lump-sum pension benefit may be paid, rather than an annuity. This could happen where the employee's calculated monthly pension amount is below a certain minimum level, or if the employee establishes that their life expectancy is short.A pension benefit, whether in the form of an annuity or lump-sum, cannot be received until the claimant establishes that they have locked-in pension credits, have reached a retirement age as specified in the plan, and apply for the pension. An exception occurs when an employee terminates their employment prior to retirement, and locked-in pension credits are unlocked by special provisions in the pension plan (Digest 5.13.6.2).Included in the category of periodic pensions, are annuity payments that are made out of a pension fund, whether that pension plan is registered under the Income Tax Act or not , as well as payments being made out of a locked-in vehicle to which pension credits had previously been transferred (Digest 5.13.10). Thus, the locked-in, non-commutable RRSP that is subsequently used to purchase an annuity at retirement age is considered earnings when the annuity payments start. The same would be true of any periodic amounts where pension credits were transferred directly from an employer's pension plan to purchase a deferred annuity, and are now paid.",47.12960651289012,14.25145183175034,15.186304673781336,18.0325644504749,17.319153324287647,12.592955223880594,65.08141112618725,10.545454545454543,3.8321798985648914,0.8956628371333406,0.3924876924929519,0.0588979043986687,0.8698962807655335,0.8527630898687575,4.994029850746268,4.0,2.7589680418274787,30.454545454545453,27.0,17.60353082539583,1.5223880597014925,1.0,0.7679826054315873,335,150,0.4477611940298507,1722,11,5.13.5,Periodic pensions,Chapter 5 - Earnings
304,304,"All pension plans set out a normal retirement age. This is the age at which an employee can retire with a full, unreduced pension. Normal retirement age can be anywhere from 60 to 65 years of age. However, some plans may provide a full, unreduced pension at a date earlier than normal retirement age. Normal retirement age simply governs the age at which the unreduced payment of pension benefits can start, under the provisions of the pension plan. Normal retirement age is not the same as a mandatory retirement age. An employer may establish a mandatory retirement age through personnel policies, whereby an employee is forced to resign when they reach that age.In addition to setting out the normal retirement age, pension plans may allow the payment of pension benefits to be either deferred, or paid at an earlier age. If the option to defer the pension benefits is taken, they may be deferred up to age 71. Early retirement age, as set out in a pension plan, is the age at which a member may elect to retire and begin receiving pension payments, prior to reaching normal retirement age. This age may be within ten years of normal retirement age, and may involve the application of an actuarial pension reduction formula to compensate for the extra number of years the pension will be paid.An employee must apply for their pension entitlement, whether it is upon reaching normal retirement or early retirement age. A pension is not automatically payable upon reaching a specified age, unless that age is beyond the maximum allowed under the pension plan. It involves a conscious choice by the employee, and the employee must meet eligibility criteria in terms of pension credits. If the pension plan allows an employee to defer the receipt of their pension to a future date, that pension is not considered payable until the employee applies and qualifies for it. Until this happens, that pension is not considered immediately due and therefore has no impact on EI benefits (Digest 5.6.1).If the claimant is of retirement age and has an option to defer the collection of a pension, but elects to receive it, that pension is considered paid or payable. In addition, if a claimant has no choice under the plan and a pension is immediately due upon reaching a certain age, the pension is considered payable when the retirement age is reached. The determination that the pension is payable does not change if the claimant chooses to make alternate arrangements to dispose of these moneys. Any transfer of that periodic pension into a regular RRSP or a locked-in, non-commutable RRSP does not change the fact that the pension amount is payable, even if it is alleged that the money was never actually physically received (CUB 66832).",55.1147165991903,11.691102114260008,13.110285616738595,14.809896536212328,13.258289473684208,10.928290598290598,54.33243364822312,7.315789473684211,3.0263787225397127,0.5705498284663345,0.4412604065465346,0.0545102899698332,0.8614343934588962,0.8667794360834009,4.75,4.0,2.664963398347136,24.63157894736842,23.0,10.322232144952643,1.497863247863248,1.0,0.7609568078085215,468,174,0.3717948717948718,2270,19,5.13.5.1,Retirement age,Chapter 5 - Earnings
305,305,"Pension bridging benefits allow an individual earlier access to moneys that normally are only payable at a future date. Bridging benefits, in the form of additional compensation, allow for an easier transition between an individual's present and future financial circumstances. The payment of bridging benefits ceases when the point of planned future compensation is reached.Bridging benefits can be paid out of a pension fund or out of general company revenue. However, not all bridging benefits paid by an employer are considered pension bridging benefits. The fact that the pension bridging benefit is not paid out of the pension fund is not relevant in determining that it is in fact a pension bridging benefit, when the criteria for a pension bridging benefit has been met.A pension bridging benefit is financial payment designed to allow an individual to move from one level of pension compensation to a future level of higher pension compensation with the addition of payments from the employer's pension fund, Canada Pension Plan (CPP) or Quebec Pension Plan (QPP). It is structured so that the total moneys received each month, during the entire period, are constant. Pension bridging benefits are paid along with a pension to top-up that pension, or until the pension entitlement is reached. This top-up may be necessary as the pension that is payable may have been reduced or delayed due to forced early retirement. Pension bridging benefits may also act as an incentive to take early retirement.A pension bridging benefit has the following characteristics: it bridges to future pension entitlement, such as a company pension, CPP/QPP and Old Age Security (OAS)the amount of the bridging benefit is based on a periodic paymentthe individual who is receiving it has reached retirement age (either early or normal)the amount that is being paid as the pension bridging benefit is approximately at the same level as the additional pension that is to be paid in the futureIf the pension bridging benefits are to be paid out of general company revenues, 3 additional conditions must be met: the bridging benefit payment period does not count towards years of service for the company pension that is to be paidthe employer's bridging benefit program must be based on the worker meeting a set age, years of service and retirement date requirements, andthe bridging benefit payment must not reduce the individual's entitlement to severance payments accumulated from that employment, according to the contract or collective agreement and/or provincial or federal labour standardsPeriodic payments include situations in which employees have a choice of receiving the bridging benefits in a lump sum rather than in monthly instalments. If a lump-sum bridging benefit meets all the other conditions to be considered a pension bridging benefit, then the monthly amount upon which the lump-sum payment was based will be determined and allocated pursuant to EIR 36(14) over the period for which it is payable, in the same manner as monthly pension bridging benefits.Because a pension bridging benefit arises out of employment, is paid at retirement age, and is usually calculated based on the employee's age, years of service and retirement date, it resembles a retirement pension and is treated and allocated as such for EI benefit purposes.Pension bridging benefits may be paid until pension entitlement is reached, or to supplement a pension or other retirement compensation, such as a pension payment from the employer's Group RRSPs (Digest 5.13.3) and/or Deferred Profit Sharing Plans (DPSPs) (Digest 5.15.3).It is not necessary that a bridging benefit be paid along with a pension to be considered a pension bridging benefit. It is sufficient that it allows the employee to make the transition to a future pension such as a company pension, CPP/QPP or OAS.An example of a pension bridging benefit is the payment of an amount equal to future CPP/QPP and/or OAS entitlement. The pension bridging benefit may be paid alone, or in addition to the basic pension, or some other retirement income already payable to the employee. It is paid until the CPP/QPP pension and/or the OAS commence.The fact that OAS is not pension earnings cannot change the nature of pension bridging benefits that are paid to compensate the employee at a level equivalent to their future OAS (EIR 35(1)). The employer or the pension fund has taken on the obligation of paying an equivalent amount until the actual OAS benefits start, and that equivalent amount becomes a retirement pension. This does not qualify these payments as OAS benefits. OAS does not meet the definition of a retirement pension arising out of employment as it is based solely on age and residence in Canada.Pension bridging benefits cannot be considered a loan unless, under the terms of the pension bridging benefit plan, there is an obligation on the part of the pensioner, to repay the loan, and documentary evidence supporting that obligation exists (FCA A-1050-90; CUB 15686B).A bridging benefit paid out of general company revenue, which does not meet the characteristics listed above, cannot be considered a pension bridging benefit and cannot be treated as a periodic pension. The allocation will depend on whether the claimant remains an employee while these payments are being made, or the employee has separated from that employment, and the payments are part of termination payments (EIR 36(5); EIR 36(9); Digest 5.7.2; Digest 5.12.7).Pension bridging benefits are no longer considered earnings if the claimant meets the requalifier exemption for pension income (Digest 5.13.13). This is true whether the pension bridging benefits are paid out of the pension fund, or out of general company revenues. As well, when pension bridging benefits are no longer payable, and the claimant starts or continues to receive the company pension, any insurable hours earned while receiving pension bridging benefits, qualify as insurable hours towards meeting the requalifier exemption for the company pension.",38.615382262996974,16.89946992864424,16.948576674445945,20.97573904179409,20.651559633027524,13.240856269113149,72.31702344546382,13.074074074074074,3.178623191854649,0.7209767472785031,0.4574939691985572,0.0548697883166637,0.8676523520396306,0.867494375705719,5.077471967380224,4.0,2.77716627671463,36.333333333333336,25.0,31.12935972738657,1.5524974515800205,1.0,0.8546487265023917,981,282,0.2874617737003058,5094,27,5.13.5.2,Pension bridging benefits,Chapter 5 - Earnings
306,306,"It is the gross amount of the periodic pension that must be allocated. This includes the basic pension amount as well as:any supplement to that pension, including any pension bridging benefits (Digest 5.13.5.2)any deductions made for the purpose of buying back previous service, or non-existent service, under the terms of the pension plan, orany other financial obligation of the claimant for which their pension is used to satisfyThe one exception to this occurs where the claimant's pension has been divided due to marital dissolution or due to spousal assignment of a CPP or QPP pension (Digest 5.13.12.1; Digest 5.13.12.2).Periodic pensions are not always the same amount for the life of the employee. Periodic pension payments from a pension fund can increase. Increases may come about when the pension is indexed to the cost of living; when the pension annuity is reviewed periodically and ad hoc increases are given to compensate for the decreased buying power of the pension, or when the pension payment is a variable or escalating life annuity.Periodic pension payments from a pension fund can also decrease. Decreases in periodic pensions may occur when:bridging benefits from a pension plan ceasewhen CPP/QPP or OAS payments start where a pension plan is integrated with these benefits, whether through exercising an option or notwhen a pension is split due to marital dissolution, orCPP/QPP payments are assigned to a spouseWhether the amount increases or decreases, the amount to be allocated is the amount of pension that is payable. When employment pensions decrease due to bridging benefits or integration with social security benefits, the amount to be allocated from the employment pension will also decrease. However, there may be a corresponding new allocation for the amount of the pension now being paid from another source (CPP or QPP). Should the pension bridging benefit be designed to bridge until OAS entitlement, there would be no corresponding increase in allocation, as OAS is not considered a pension for EI purposes (EIR 35(1)).Periodic pensions resulting from employment are usually paid monthly, towards the end of the month. If the exact amount of the gross pension is not known, an estimate will be used until the exact figure is available.In order to obtain the weekly amount for allocation, monthly periodic pensions are converted to a weekly amount by multiplying the monthly amount by twelve (12) to obtain the yearly figure, then dividing that figure by 52. If the start of the pension begins other than at the beginning of a week, the weekly amount will be pro-rated for the number of working days the pension was payable (that is, one-fifth for each working day).Periodic pensions are allocated to the period for which they are paid or payable (EIR 36(14)). A periodic pension, like a lump-sum pension benefit, is allocated concurrently with any other earnings earned during that period (EIR 36(16)). In addition, periodic pension payments do not prevent an interruption of earnings (EIR 35(5)).",41.94495472837022,16.228038229376264,15.43852017318444,19.43138832997988,19.907907444668005,12.813521126760564,67.49195171026156,11.357142857142858,3.148203192801798,0.7942048254692531,0.4456306117543945,0.0490557751722755,0.8753462938161997,0.8819782137870789,5.00804828973843,4.0,2.781068439226924,35.5,24.5,25.47758118144544,1.523138832997988,1.0,0.7846411775493832,497,202,0.4064386317907444,2553,14,5.13.5.3,Amount of periodic pension to be allocated,Chapter 5 - Earnings
307,307,"The goal of all pension plans is to pay a pension benefit at retirement (Digest 5.13.5.1). A pension benefit is an annual, monthly, or other periodic amount to which an employee is, or will be entitled, upon retirement. This periodic payment is commonly called an annuity. Although the goal of all pension plans is the same, the type of pension benefit payable under a pension plan depends on whether the plan is registered under the Income Tax Act (Digest 5.13.10).What the pension legislation envisions, and what is reflected in the registered pension plans themselves, is that the pension benefit employees will receive will be in the form of an annuity. In addition, that annuity will be payable only on retirement. However, although the stated intention of pension plans is to pay pension benefits as an annuity, there are some restricted circumstances where the pension plan allows the transfer of accumulated pension credits (locked-in contributions) into a lump-sum payment. This is called a lump-sum pension benefit. Although it is normally paid on termination of employment due to retirement, it may be paid earlier under special unlocking provisions allowed under some pension plans, or as a return of additional voluntary contributions (AVCs) to the claimant (Digest 5.13.6.2; Digest 5.13.9.1). Lump-sum pension benefits are considered payable no matter how the claimant chooses to dispose of them (Digest 5.13.6.3). A lump-sum pension benefit is converted to an annuity, and then allocated starting with the week for which it became paid or payable (Digest 5.13.6.4).",47.58308823529416,12.95735294117647,14.554592549557764,16.47450980392157,15.128588235294115,12.762039215686276,61.97058823529412,9.3,3.1620480125725208,0.9012671696414468,0.4145134922675008,0.0683454023491668,0.8153011931313409,0.7924709245562553,5.0549019607843135,4.0,2.774697561720153,25.5,20.5,17.211914478058507,1.576470588235294,1.0,0.8074623126746227,255,116,0.4549019607843137,1331,10,5.13.6,Lump-sum pension benefit,Chapter 5 - Earnings

309,309,"If the employee has not reached retirement age (early or normal retirement age), it is highly unlikely that what is being paid is a lump-sum pension benefit. The one exception to the only payable at retirement rule would be if the payment results from special unlocking of previously locked-in pension credits, allowed by some pension plans and under pension legislation.This special provision allows the employee to choose to receive, as partial discharge of their rights under the plan, a transfer of a portion of their locked-in pension credits. If allowed under the employee's pension plan, this option is open to the employee on the termination of employment, even if the employee has not reached normal retirement age. The partial transfer allowed is usually an amount up to 25% of the employee's accumulated locked-in pension credits prior to a date specified in the pension plan, and the applicable pension legislation. Although this provision generally applies to pension credits accumulated prior to a specified date, this may not be the same under all legislation. Whether a date is specified or not, the guidance is the same for any of these types of payments. The employee, on termination, can only access up to 25% of the locked-in contributions in this fashion. The remaining 75% must be used to support the payment of either a deferred or an immediate annuity. Which one, depends on the employee's specific circumstances and whether they have applied for, and are entitled to receive a pension.Partial transfer amounts generally do not identify which contributions (employer, employee, or both) are being returned. Nevertheless, even if these amounts are identified as employee contributions, it is not relevant to the determination that these moneys are a lump-sum pension benefit. These moneys are not a return of excess employee contributions as established by the provisions of the pension legislation. They are in reality a portion of the employee's pension that has been unlocked, therefore allowing the employee immediate access to this part of their pension annuity in the form of a lump-sum payment (Digest 5.13.8.1). The total pension amount that the employee will receive will be the same using this option; the only difference is that it includes both a lump-sum pension benefit, and a periodic pension.A lump-sum pension benefit can be distinguished from a return of contributions. This distinction is based on the specific terms and wording included in the pension plan documents and the point at which the pension contributions are locked-in by the legislation. For example, a pay out of moneys prior to lock-in is normally a return of contributions, whereas a payout after lock-in is generally a lump-sum pension payment arising out of unlocking pension credits.Any other lump-sum payment linked to a retirement or separation, but made outside the terms of the pension plan and without immediate pension entitlement according to the terms of the pension plan, is likely a lump-sum payment made by reason of separation. As they result from a lay-off or separation, these retirement payments are allocated from the week of the lay-off or separation, at normal weekly earnings (EIR 36(9); Digest 5.12.7).",47.44228066914502,13.324791821561336,14.554592549557764,16.707955390334572,15.070985130111524,11.876654275092935,59.24200743494424,8.7,3.203276703276552,0.7898830215220451,0.4489853075616715,0.0615277380797412,0.8599116927699039,0.8565167155530717,4.894052044609666,4.0,2.832682653577474,26.9,28.5,8.030566605165541,1.5613382899628252,1.0,0.8649256327823311,538,182,0.3382899628252788,2717,20,5.13.6.2,Prior to retirement age,Chapter 5 - Earnings

311,311,"Lump-sum pension benefits are allocated in a special way. Since these earnings are paid to the claimant in lieu of a pension, they are meant to compensate them in the same way as a pension does. If allocated using normal weekly earnings, this would apportion these earnings to a relatively short period of time and not as they are actually intended; to cover the claimant for the rest of their life, in the same manner as a periodic pension would. As such, lump-sum pension benefits are converted to the equivalent of what these payments would have been, had they been paid as an annuity (EIR 36(15); EIR 36(17)).The table below, which is updated annually, is used to perform this calculation.Table: Weekly annuity equivalents for a lump sum of $1,000 according to age of claimantWeekly annuity equivalents for a lump sum of $1,000 according to age of claimantLump-sum pension benefit paid or payable from December 31, 2023 to  December 28, 2024\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(week code 2428 to 2479)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCalculated pursuant to subsection 36(17) of the EIRLump-sum pension benefit paid or payable from January 1, 2023 to December  30, 2023\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(week code 2376 to 2427) Calculated pursuant to subsection 36(17) of the EIRLump-sum pension benefit paid or payable from December 26, 2021 to December 31, 2022\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(week code 2323 to 2375)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCalculated pursuant to subsection 36(17) of the EIRAge of claimantWeekly annuity\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tequivalentAge of claimantWeekly annuity\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tequivalentAge of claimantWeekly annuity\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tequivalent19 and under0.7019 and under0.5819 and under0.47200.70200.58200.47210.70210.58210.47220.71220.59220.48230.71230.60230.48240.71240.60240.49250.72250.60250.49260.72260.60260.50270.73270.61270.50280.73280.61280.51290.74290.62290.51300.74300.62300.52310.75310.63310.52320.75320.64320.53330.76330.64330.54340.76340.65340.54350.77350.66350.55360.78360.66360.56370.78370.67370.57380.79380.68380.57390.80390.69390.58400.81400.69400.59410.81410.70410.60420.82420.71420.61430.83430.72430.62440.84440.73440.63450.85450.74450.64460.86460.75460.65470.87470.76470.66480.89480.78480.68490.90490.79490.69500.91500.80500.70510.93510.82510.72520.94520.83520.73530.96530.85530.75540.97540.86540.77550.99550.88550.78561.01560.90560.80571.03570.92570.82581.05580.94580.84591.07590.96590.87601.10600.99600.89611.12611.01610.91621.15621.04620.94631.18631.07630.97641.21641.10641.00651.24651.13651.03661.28661.17661.07671.32671.20671.11681.36681.24681.15691.40.691.29691.19701.45701.33701.23711.50711.38711.28721.55721.43721.34731.61731.49731.40741.68741.56741.46751.74751.62751.53761.82761.70761.60771.90771.78771.68781.99781.86781.77792.09791.96791.86802.19802.06801.97812.31812.18812.08822.43822.30822.21832.57832.44832.35842.73842.59842.50852.90852.76852.67863.09862.95862.86873.30873.17873.07883.54883.40883.31893.79893.66893.5890 and over4.0890 and over3.9690 and over3.87The table shows the annuity equivalent amount for each $1000 of lump-sum payment made. The claimant's age at the time of the lump-sum payment determines the annuity equivalent amount to be used in the calculation. The lump-sum amount is divided by 1000, and the resulting figure is multiplied by the annuity equivalent amount.For example: A $30,000 lump-sum pension payment paid July 9, 2024, to a claimant who was 56 years of age would be allocated at an amount of $30.30 (30,000/1000 = 30 x $1.01) per week. The impact on this claim is vastly different than if this amount was allocated at a normal weekly earnings rate of $600.00 for 50 weeks.Due to the vast difference in the outcome between an allocation as a lump-sum pension benefit and other types of lump-sum earnings, only amounts that are truly a lump-sum pension benefit are treated in this manner. To determine whether an amount is a lump-sum pension benefit, the provisions of the pension plan and the applicable pension legislation must be examined.Lump-sum pension amounts are allocated concurrently with any other earnings paid or payable during that period (EIR 36(16) ). In addition, lump-sum pension payments do not prevent an interruption of earnings (EIR 35(5)).For registered pension plans, a lump-sum pension benefit includes only those sums paid or payable from locked-in pension credits, which are due to the claimant as a retiree under the terms and conditions of that plan, or, under the provisions of the plan or pension legislation that allows access to these locked-in moneys.",47.39114285714287,15.34419047619048,15.557879425188943,19.40952380952381,31.30977142857143,27.347885714285702,63.57142857142857,10.0,3.221433528974686,1.27737283037601,0.4487805989771543,0.0367019143721314,0.7377518766692707,0.6850373074412346,7.481904761904762,4.0,55.40147974807752,35.0,27.0,21.22577050034541,1.4647619047619047,1.0,0.8218424078317312,525,200,0.3809523809523809,3998,15,5.13.6.4,Allocation of a lump-sum pension benefit,Chapter 5 - Earnings
312,312,"Due to the mobility that occurs within the labour force, an employee may not spend their entire career with just one employer. The employee is protected in that, if the employment was only for a short time and lock-in has not occurred, they can receive a return of all the contributions made to the pension plan. However, no refund can be made once pension contributions are locked into the pension fund under the terms of the plan.Recognizing the need to be able to move locked-in pension contributions, pension legislation requires that pension plans under its jurisdiction, allow for the transfer of pension credits (locked-in pension contributions and the accumulated interest) when employment ends. This ability to transfer pension credits to another financial vehicle, where they will ultimately be used to pay a pension, is called portability. Non-registered pension plan contributions cannot be transferred in this manner as they are not considered to be locked-in pension credits under pension legislation (Digest 5.13.10).The condition on the transfer of accumulated pension credits is that they must move directly from the pension fund into one of the locked-in vehicles approved by the pension legislation for this purpose. In addition, these moneys must remain locked in until retirement age is reached.The acceptable locked-in vehicles are the following:another employer's pension plan, if the other plan permits this transfer of pension creditsa locked-in, non-commutable RRSP; or some other similar vehicle, such as a provincial Locked-in Retirement Account (LIRA), or a Compte de Retraite ImmobilisÃ© (CRI) in the province of Quebec, which have all the same provisions as a locked-in, non-commutable RRSP (Digest 5.13.2), andan annuity purchase contractSometimes, due to the types of pension plans involved and the various benefits these plans provide, transfer of contributions from one plan to another is not possible. The plan, to which the pension credits are to be transferred, must permit this transfer.If pension credits are transferred directly from one locked-in vehicle to another on termination of employment, it is considered that nothing was paid or payable to the claimant. Moreover, these pension credits can only be accessed at retirement age, according to the specified provisions of each locked-in vehicle. Therefore it is only at that time that any legal entitlement to an immediate payment exists. Claimants who arrange for the transfer of their pension credits in this manner will not have any earnings allocated from these vehicles until they are paid out under the terms of the locked-in vehicle.At age 71, any moneys in a locked-in RRSP must be used to purchase an annuity. Once the pension becomes payable, it is allocated against EI benefits.",48.918773158278654,14.004910284463891,13.968273953766031,16.91314369073669,17.332720641867247,12.602713347921224,61.97651349380014,9.6,3.296139614963763,1.1474686142596546,0.4115687303401395,0.0392293510252847,0.8608262836933136,0.869311470251817,4.99562363238512,4.0,2.8012154470668107,30.466666666666665,22.0,22.159622941036,1.50109409190372,1.0,0.8078518574168373,457,177,0.387308533916849,2352,15,5.13.7,Portability of locked-in pension credits,Chapter 5 - Earnings
313,313,"Although it is the intention of all plans to pay a pension benefit upon retirement from employment, sometimes the employment ends before an employee reaches retirement age. If the employee has worked a sufficient period of time, according to the terms of the pension plan, the contributions made while employed are non-refundable (that is, they are locked-in). These contributions and the accumulated interest (pension credits), can only be used to support a deferred pension, or they can be transferred to another locked-in vehicle (Digest 5.13.7). Contributions and the accumulated interest that are not locked in, and to which the employee has a vested right under the terms of the plan, will be paid to the employee on termination of employment (Digest 5.13.2).When reference is made to contributions in this section, whether they are employee or employer generated, they include the interest that has accumulated on them. Should the claimant be entitled to additional interest on any contributions because the employer has delayed in refunding those contributions to the claimant, that interest amount would not be included in any allocation (Digest 5.3.1.6).Pensions can be funded through contributions made by both the employer and the employee, or the employer alone.

314,314,"Employee contributions to the pension fund are made while employed. These contributions can be based on either a fixed amount, or a percentage of salary. These contributions are made by way of payroll deductions, and form part of the employee's gross earnings from employment during each pay period.All pension plans recognize that employees have a vested right to their own contributions. As a result, on termination, employees are entitled to receive a refund of all their own employee contributions that were not locked-in.However, it is not only employees who have been employed for a short period of time with an employer, who may receive a return of their employee contributions. There are times when an employee may receive a refund of employee contributions, even after lock-in has occurred. Pension legislation for defined benefit pension plans may require that no employee's contributions, including any accumulated interest, can be more than 50% of the commuted value of the pension. This type of refund is simply a return of the contributions that have been determined to be in excess of the amounts an employee is required to contribute, pursuant to pension legislation. This requirement is referred to by a number of terms: maximum funding by employee contributions, minimum employer cost, defined benefit, or maximum cost provision. When the employment is terminated, an actuary who reviews the employee's pension credits will determine whether there has been an excess of employee contributions. These excess employee contributions must be returned to the employee, according to the terms of the pension legislation.In all cases where employee contributions are returned to the employee on termination, they are earnings arising out of employment (EIR 35(2)). That being said, these earnings formed part of the employee's gross weekly earnings during employment, and would have been considered earnings at that time, and not at the time of termination (EIR 36(4) & (5)).

However, pension legislation only sets out the minimum requirements that plans must follow, and individual plans may set vesting at an earlier date than lock-in. If an employee is entitled to receive any employer contributions on termination, it will be because the employer contributions are vested, but not locked-in.Vested right to the employer's contributions according to the terms of the planSome pension plans contain provisions that give employees vested rights to the employer contributions that are not locked-in. These moneys are fully refundable because they are not locked-in under the pension plan. If they were locked-in, the claimant would not have access to them. Employer contributions that are not locked-in cannot have the character of an amount on account of, or in lieu of a pension, as the employee is not of retirement age and is not entitled to a pension benefit. They are solely a return of contributions. Although they are not considered as pension earnings, these moneys are earnings as they fall under the entire income arising out of any employment (EIR 35(2)). Once these moneys are identified as earnings, it must be determined how they are to be allocated. These earnings are paid out of the pension fund because the employee's employment ended, which gives them the characteristics of a retirement benefit. As the reason these earnings were paid is because of a lay-off or separation, they must be allocated as a termination payment, at normal weekly earnings, starting from the week of lay-off or separation (EIR 36(9); Digest 5.12.7). These earnings are considered payable and must be allocated, even if the claimant places them into a locked-in non-commutable RRSP. Only locked-in pension credits can benefit from transfer to a locked-in vehicle, and avoid being considered payable; the return of employer contributions cannot be considered as such.No vested right to employer's contributions according to the terms of the planSome pension plans have no provision for the vesting of employer contributions when employment is terminated prior to retirement age. Termination of employment due to business closures or bankruptcies, and any resultant pension plan wind-up, can result in the payment of employer contributions to workers, who are not covered under the provisions of the pension plan. If these moneys are given to the workers, they cannot be considered a pension benefit under the terms of the plan, as there is no right to such a benefit (only a deferred annuity or death benefit may be allowed by the plan). They also cannot be considered a return of contributions under the pension plan, as there is no such provision within the plan. Therefore, these moneys, which have not been locked-in, are considered to be paid by virtue of provincial legislation or through the employer's gratuitous gesture, due to the closure of the company. These payments are made by reason of the termination of employment and the resultant wrap-up of the pension plan. Their true nature is a type of termination payment and not a pension benefit.  As such, they would be allocated at normal weekly earnings starting from the week of lay-off or separation, as are all payments made by reason of a lay-off or separation (EIR 36(9); Digest 5.12.7; Digest 5.12.4).",51.13430696661828,12.710457184325112,14.554592549557764,16.637735849056607,14.672728592162557,11.61253991291727,54.366473149492016,7.384615384615385,3.1442195232128185,0.7772513119060148,0.4438242049096708,0.0704047702331519,0.8742389678955078,0.8622232427199682,4.851959361393324,4.0,2.908098859491854,26.5,25.5,10.605695131898202,1.5224963715529751,1.0,0.8736601238243105,689,208,0.3018867924528302,3451,26,5.13.8.2,Return of employer contributions,Chapter 5 - Earnings
316,316,"Pension plans can be contributory or non-contributory. Whether a plan is contributory depends on whether the employee is required to make contributions. In a non-contributory plan, the employer contributes the entire cost of the pension benefit. The employee in these plans is not  required to contribute anything. A contributory plan, on the other hand, is a plan where the employees are required to contribute towards their pensions, and the employer pays the balance of the costs.All pension plans set out what is required in contributions, whether by their members and the employer, or the employer alone. Some pension plans allow their employees to increase their pension amounts on retirement by making additional pension contributions on a voluntary basis, buying back past service where no contributions had been made, or purchasing additional years of service, whether or not those years have been worked.When these pension benefits, funded through additional contributions to the pension fund, are paid out, either through receipt of an annuity or in a lump sum, they are handled differently depending on whether they were additional voluntary contributions (AVCs) or additional required contributions (ARCs) to the pension fund.",42.67485824742269,13.331417525773196,15.414825405933506,17.328865979381444,15.556030927835046,14.0160824742268,60.33247422680412,8.75,2.9785051169590644,0.8458329657119289,0.4256348914243651,0.0544964726458182,0.8663229516574315,0.8797106742858887,5.278350515463917,4.0,3.110482006076968,24.25,18.0,14.385322380815802,1.649484536082474,1.0,0.9795984566947854,194,91,0.4690721649484536,1050,8,5.13.9,Additional contributions to a pension fund,Chapter 5 - Earnings
317,317,"Some pension plans allow employees the option to make extra contributions to the pension fund, with a view to increase the amounts that they would otherwise receive from the pension plan on retirement. These extra contributions are commonly known as additional voluntary contributions (AVCs). There is a limit on the extent of the AVCs that an employee can make into the pension plan. AVCs have no direct effect on the employer's pension costs. The employer is not required to match these AVCs, as the employer may do with the required contributions an employee pays into the pension fund.An employee may choose to put AVCs into their pension fund for a number of reasons. The investment rate offered by the pension fund may be higher than the individual could obtain if they invested with another institution. It may be chosen for the ease in investment, as contributions are made through payroll deductions and saving is thus ensured. Whatever the employee's reasons for choosing to place AVCs into the pension fund, the fact remains that the individual could have made that same investment elsewhere. They had that option, as these AVCs are not required of the employee, by their pension plan.AVCs are tax deductible and count towards the pension adjustment amount for income tax purposes. They, therefore, reduce the amounts available for contribution into a personal RRSP in a particular tax year.AVCs, once made, are accounted for separately from the employee's required contributions. They are never combined with the required contributions in the fund. They must remain separate, or they lose their characterization as AVCs. When employees receive a summary of their contributions in the fund, they will receive a report on the status of 2 separate amounts, their required contribution accumulation, as well as their AVCs.Although not locked-in under pension legislation, once made, AVCs must remain in the pension plan during the entire period of employment. The employee cannot access them while still employed. There is one exception to this rule and it occurs if the pension plan is subsequently amended so that it no longer has the provision allowing AVCs. In that case, all employees who had AVCs accumulated in the plan up until that date would be able to roll them over into a RRSP on a one-time basis.On termination of employment due to retirement, AVCs are an exception allowed to the rule regarding pension contributions, under the Income Tax Act. Although AVCs cannot be withdrawn until the termination of employment, they can be paid on termination as a lump-sum payment, should the employee choose to receive them in that form, rather than as an annuity for life.Lump-sum payments of AVCs and portions of annuities derived solely from AVCs are not earnings for EI benefit purposes. AVCs are more like a purchase of a private pension plan than a required contribution to the pension plan. Pensions arising from private pension plans are not  earnings for EI purposes. They do not meet the definition of a pension, according to the Regulations, as they do not arise out of employment. Despite the fact that the moneys used for the contributions were earned during employment, the contributions were entirely voluntary and could have potentially been invested anywhere. This excludes them as a pension under the definition in EIR 35(1). If a portion of the claimant's pension entitlement is exempted from consideration as earnings due to its characterization as an AVC, it must be clearly identified as such by the pension administrators.",57.07141891891894,10.370365796831315,12.793724455304456,13.77362534948742,11.921136416589,11.643445945945944,48.2854147250699,5.689655172413793,2.7046822947429945,0.475857073757272,0.4567764957795094,0.0593356838231804,0.8244719803333282,0.8308437113408689,4.913851351351352,4.0,2.8618549134208653,20.41379310344828,20.0,7.880649550418046,1.525337837837838,1.0,0.9075694564594092,592,226,0.3817567567567567,2978,29,5.13.9.1,Additional voluntary contributions (AVCs),Chapter 5 - Earnings
318,318,"Members of defined benefit pension plans are often paid their pension entitlement based on years of service. During those years of service, contributions to the pension plan are required. Some pension plans may provide for increased pension payments if plan members obtain (that is, buy back) additional years of pensionable service.Pursuant to this type of plan, plan members can have years of service when no contributions were previously made, considered as years of pensionable service, by making the contributions that would otherwise have been required. Depending on the provisions of the particular pension plan, this may apply to years of past service with the present employer, or other previous employers. Once the employee decides to do this, the additional contributions now required to support those additional years of service are calculated and these moneys must be paid into the pension fund. Depending on the provision of the pension plan, this may be done through the payment of a lump-sum amount, by installments, or as a deduction from the periodic pension to which the employee has or will become entitled. These payments, once made, become part of the pension fund; meaning they are not accounted for separately and can no longer be differentiated from any other required locked-in contribution under the pension plan.Some pension plans allow an employee to purchase years of non-existent service in order to meet retirement requirements. The employee may be responsible for both the employer's and the employee's portion of the contributions in these pension buy-back situations. As it is with buying back years of previously worked service, the amount of additional contributions now required to purchase those additional years is calculated, and the employee must pay that amount. The payment arrangements may be the same as in the case of buying back previous service.Purchasing years of service, whether they were previously worked or not, cannot be considered an AVC. Although deciding to make the purchase may be voluntary, once that decision is made, these contributions are then required under the plan, and must be made in order to increase the employee's pension to the level desired. These contributions are considered ARCs by CRA. They become part of the pension plan and are not accounted for separately, as are AVCs. As a result, any pension payable from ARCs is earnings, as no portion is considered derived from AVCs.",52.613856700574985,11.751499336576735,13.68109245194396,15.202771634969777,14.067775320654576,12.60411027568922,54.798909037299126,7.352941176470588,2.787207621290666,0.479745482939369,0.4749679194315873,0.0525689198573217,0.8802371136844158,0.8784154574076335,5.045112781954887,4.0,2.826294353786889,23.47058823529412,22.0,9.24259733713052,1.5413533834586466,1.0,0.851164128630312,399,148,0.3709273182957393,2066,17,5.13.9.2,Additional required contributions (ARCs),Chapter 5 - Earnings
319,319,"The Post-retirement benefit (PRB) is an additional benefit available to people who are already receiving CPP. Individuals who work while receiving their CPP pension can continue to make contributions to the CPP, based on employment after the start of their CPP pension. These individuals are then eligible for an additional amount from CPP, referred to as a post-retirement benefit.In January of each year, a client's eligibility for an additional PRB amount is determined based on the person's employment from the previous year, and the new combined CPP and PRB amount is calculated.The PRB is considered earnings pursuant to EIR 35(2)(e), and must be allocated against EI benefits. This applies even if the current CPP allocation (including any current PRB) is a re-qualified pension. However, the most recent PRB can also become a re-qualified pension if the required conditions are met (EIR 35(7)(e); Digest 5.13.13).The equivalent exists for people who are receiving a retirement pension under the QuÃ©bec Pension Plan.

320,320,"A retirement compensation package may comprise different pension plan components; a pension plan registered under the Income Tax Act, as well as a non-registered pension plan.The Income Tax Act sets out the maximum pension benefit that a pension plan may provide, to remain registered for the purposes of receiving income tax deductions for pension contributions. If an employer makes a commitment to pay pension benefits in excess of this maximum, the excess benefits cannot be included in the registered pension plan. If these excess benefits were to remain in the pension plan, the entire pension plan would no longer meet the criteria for registration under the Income Tax Act. In order to avoid this, the employer may create a non-registered pension plan just to pay these excess benefits. These benefits are then paid out of general company revenues and not out of the registered pension fund.The key to handling any payments made under a non-registered pension plan is to determine the true nature of the payment. These payments are then treated in the same manner as any similar payment out of a registered pension plan.Generally, payments from a non-registered pension plan are either a lump-sum pension benefit, a periodic pension, or a return of contributions. The nature of these payments depends on whether or not an individual is eligible for retirement. The applicable early and normal retirement ages are set out in the provisions of the non-registered pension plan. These ages are generally the same as those in the registered pension plan, as they are designed to supplement the registered pension amounts.When an individual reaches retirement age, either early or normal, the employee's pension is calculated using all components, based on the formula developed by the company for this purpose. Any pension payable from the registered pension plan is supplemented by either an additional periodic pension, or a lump-sum pension benefit paid out of the non-registered pension plan. However, the non-registered pension may be paid separately. Regardless of the fact that this pension is paid by the company, and is not paid out of a registered pension plan, these moneys still meet the definition of a retirement pension arising out of employment (EIR 35(1)). The allocation will be the same as for any pension; that is, periodic pensions are allocated to the period for which the pension is paid or payable and lump-sum pension benefits are converted to an annuity and allocated from the week paid or payable (Digest 5.13.5.3; Digest 5.13.6.4). Should the employee defer the receipt of the registered portion, the non-registered portion, or both portions, allocation only occurs when the pension becomes payable (Digest 5.13.4).If an individual leaves employment prior to retirement age, the plan may allow the employee to leave all pension entitlement in the pension plans (both registered and non-registered) until retirement age is reached. This is treated in the same way as any deferred pension entitlement. The allocation does not start until the employee elects to receive their pension as it is only then that the pensions are considered payable (Digest 5.13.4).On termination of employment prior to retirement age, a claimant may receive the commuted value of their non-registered pension entitlement. These moneys are earnings and are allocated in the same manner as any other payment made by reason of a lay-off or separation, and the same way as a return of employer contributions (Digest 5.13.8.2). The manner in which the claimant disposes of these moneys does not alter this allocation. As these moneys are accessible to the claimant on termination, they cannot avoid allocation by transferring them to a locked-in vehicle.\t\t\tAllocation of pension payments\t\t\tSituationType of paymentAllocation of earningsRetirement age reachedPeriodic pensionRegulation 36(14)Lump-sum pension benefitRegulation 36(15) and 36(17)Pension deferredNot until payablePrior to retirement agePension deferredNot until payableReturn of contributionsRegulation 36(9)",44.15792270531404,14.099369296833064,14.616519792027317,17.010305958132047,17.18093800322061,13.765308641975302,61.35292538915728,9.347826086956522,3.240277402191904,0.6482812928533553,0.4305938738577194,0.064660862430873,0.8842267502437938,0.8924761925424848,5.20679012345679,4.0,3.27690433830034,28.17391304347826,27.0,12.990472006396084,1.5848765432098766,1.0,0.937335821116714,648,205,0.316358024691358,3454,23,5.13.10,Non-registered pension plans,Chapter 5 - Earnings
321,321,"In addition to the various payments that may arise from a pension fund, an employee may also receive a payment that is attributed to either a surplus in the pension fund itself, or contributions which are in excess of those allowed by CRA. The implication of these payments on EI benefits depends on how the pension fund reassigns these moneys. Due to the pension legislation provisions, distribution of money from a pension fund is restricted to certain types of moneys that can only be paid under limited circumstances. It is the true nature of what is being paid that determines how these payments are treated.",55.30553571428574,12.066547619047622,13.427899808715576,15.452380952380953,14.21328571428571,11.184380952380948,54.82142857142857,7.5,2.73768115942029,0.2544933313518911,0.4722222222222222,0.0481125224324688,0.8485399087270101,0.8598760664463043,4.780952380952381,4.0,2.814861757177098,26.25,22.5,10.66243405606806,1.4761904761904765,1.0,0.8058741257640448,105,64,0.6095238095238096,509,4,5.13.11,Pension fund surplus and contributions in excess of CRA limitations,Chapter 5 - Earnings
322,322,"In a defined contribution pension plan, the yearly contribution level is set out in the pension plan and is designed to accumulate a reasonable amount in the pension fund. The pension that a plan member will receive on retirement is the amount of annuity the accumulated contributions and interest will purchase. Defined contribution pension plans can have no surplus as the pension to be paid is based on the amount of accumulated contributions in the fund at retirement age.In a defined benefit pension plan, actuaries must estimate how much must be contributed to the plan each year, in order to accumulate an amount sufficient to support the level of benefits promised in the pension plan. This is not an easy task. In estimating yearly levels of contributions for the final average and career average pension plans, the actuary must factor in anticipated future salary levels, longevity, rate of return on the moneys invested, or other assumptions. Higher than expected return on investments, or setting the contribution rate too high, can result in a greater amount in the fund than is required to support all the present and anticipated commitments of the pension fund. This is called a pension plan surplus. The surplus exists in the pension fund itself, and not in each individual employee's accumulated pension credits.As defined benefit pension plans are based on estimates of the amounts needed to be able to pay a future benefit, these plans can have a surplus (for example, a gain) or a deficit (for example, a deficiency). Pension legislation requires the administrator of the pension plan to file an actuarial report annually, certifying that all contributions for that fiscal year have been made. In addition, at specified intervals, a more detailed report is required on the status of the fund, and whether there are any surpluses or deficiencies.What happens when there is a surplus will depend on who ultimately owns the surplus, according to the provisions of the pension plan. These provisions include any subsequent amendments made to that plan. The surplus will revert to the employer if there is such a provision in the pension plan. Generally, it is the employer who is responsible for making up any shortfalls in pension funding in defined benefit plans. As a result, it is often the employer who benefits by receiving the surplus, should there be one in the fund. However, this may not always be the case.A surplus in a pension fund may be discovered when the periodic reports of the plan's status are prepared. It may also be discovered on wind-up of the pension plan if a business closes or the plan terminates. Regardless of how it is discovered, CRA has very specific rules as to whether any identified surplus can be used, and how it can be used. The surplus may be refunded directly to the employer; may be used to provide a contribution holiday (that is, a period of no contributions) for the employer, the employee, or both; or may be used to increase benefits under the plan.The way in which a surplus will be used is often a joint decision of the parties who contribute to the fund, even for pension funds where the employer has ownership of the surplus. In plans where employees make contributions to the pension fund, decisions on what the employer will do with the surplus may be influenced by the employee's representatives.Whatever happens with the surplus, the implications for EI benefits will depend on the way that these moneys are distributed to the employee: that is, based on the true nature of these moneys. Due to the limited options open to the employer, a surplus can only be distributed in certain ways. The fact that these moneys may have resulted from a surplus will not change the character of what they represent.If the choice is to have the surplus refunded to the employer in cash, there will be no implication for a claimant's EI benefits, unless the employer chooses to pass the benefits of the surplus on to the employees. Since  the surplus is the employer's, the means used to pass on the surplus will have to be examined. If it is simply given to the employees, it will be handled in the same manner as all gratuitous payments, and will depend on whether the payment is by reason of a lay-off or separation (EIR 36(9); Digest 5.12.2; Digest 5.12.4). If the employer uses the money to satisfy any of their other obligations, such as paying wages in lieu of notice or severance pay , it will be treated as such (Digest 5.12.5; Digest 5.12.6).If a surplus is identified and the choice is made to use that surplus to increase benefits under the pension plan, it will be allocated according to the nature of the payment. If it increases the amount of a periodic or a lump-sum pension, it is allocated in the same fashion as these pensions (Digest 5.13.5; Digest 5.13.6). If it increases the amount of accumulated pension credits, these credits are treated in the same manner as any other pension credits (Digest 5.13.7). If it is refunded to employees on termination, as part of the employer or employee contributions, it is treated as such (Digest 5.13.8).If the choice is to use the surplus to provide a contribution holiday to the employee, the only implication for EI benefits is if the contribution holiday changes the nature of past contributions made. Although a rare occurrence, the nature of past contributions may be altered by the utilization of a surplus to provide a contribution holiday for plan members. A surplus may be used to make a contributory plan (employee and employer contribute) into a non-contributory one (only employer  contributes) for a portion of the years of past service. In these situations, the surplus funds replace contributions already made by plan members, for a specific period of their past pensionable service. Those years of pensionable service, which were funded by the employee's required contributions, are now funded by the surplus funds. The employee contributions that were previously required now become AVCs. If this occurs, when these newly created AVCs come out of the fund, they will be treated in the same way as all other AVCs (Digest 5.13.9).Contribution holidays for employees, whether for present or future contributions, will not have any impact, as it is only a pause in the requirement to make contributions. Furthermore, as their regular contributions are made out of the employees' gross earnings, the only benefit of the contribution holiday is to increase the employees' net pay.\t\t\t\tDistribution of pension fund surplus\t\t\t\tPension fund surplus use:MethodAllocationRefunded to employerpassed gratuitously to the employeesallocation will depend on whether the payment was made by reason of the lay-off or separation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRegulation 36(9); or 36(19)used to fulfil other financial obligations of the employer in regards to separationallocate depending on what type of payment the employer is makingTo increase benefits of the pension planincreased pensionallocate as a pensionIncreased amount of contributions returned to the employee on separationallocate as a return of either employer or employee contributions depending on how identifiedincreased amount of pension credits in the fundnot considered as payable if transferred to a locked-in vehicle or left in the fundTo provide a contribution holidayreplaced past required contributions with the surplus and these past contributions become AVCsif pension portion attributable to the AVC can be clearly identified-not earningsif AVCs returned to the claimant in a lump sum-not earnings",45.19045484727761,14.379428002276608,15.4700424275458,18.19939290457219,16.75273117055587,12.225211155378483,59.60206791880098,8.880952380952381,3.050906785441127,0.6741640876238004,0.4371104855815432,0.0702733768418026,0.8481395186447516,0.836602153070271,4.9346613545816735,4.0,3.2958554477299566,29.88095238095238,25.5,26.04684642364177,1.5521912350597609,1.0,0.9523849175402956,1255,357,0.2844621513944223,6340,42,5.13.11.1,Pension fund surplus,Chapter 5 - Earnings
323,323,"Under the Income Tax Act, there is a restriction on the maximum level of pension benefits that a defined benefit pension plan, or a combination pension plan may provide. An employer cannot register a pension plan that contains provisions for benefits to be paid in excess of these maximums. If an employer wishes to provide benefits in excess of these amounts, the employer will have to pay them outside the terms of the pension plan, or have their plan un-registered (Digest 5.13.10). Non-registration of a pension plan means that any contributions made to that plan are not eligible as a deduction for the purposes of income tax.In addition to the pension plan's provisions regarding the anticipated level of pension benefits, the accumulated contributions and interest in the plan for a specific employee cannot generate a pension benefit that exceeds the maximum limit. The regulations under the Income Tax Act require that all pension plans include a provision allowing for the return of excess employer and employee contributions, to the contributor. As a result, there will be a subsequent reduction of accrued pension benefit.The calculation of whether a specific employee has exceeded the maximum level of benefits is done on termination of employment, if the employee chooses to transfer locked-in pension credits out of the pension plan. The calculation to determine if there are any excess contributions only applies to employees whose contributions are locked-in. In all other instances, employees simply receive a return of contributions.Employees whose contributions are locked-in have acquired a right to a pension on retirement. However, it is only after all the contributions are made, the length of the pensionable service is known, and interest on the contributions has accumulated, that the final pension benefit can be calculated. If the employee elects to transfer the accumulated pension credits out of the pension plan on termination, any amounts in excess of the CRA maximum are taxable.What happens to the taxable excess depends on the provisions of the applicable pension legislation. The pension legislation may require that the taxable excess be refunded to the employee. If it is no longer locked in and is refunded to the employee, it is treated as a lump-sum pension benefit for EI purposes. This is because accumulated pension credits are being refunded after lock-in has occurred (Digest 5.13.6). Pension credits, which are no longer locked-in under the provisions of pension legislation, are considered payable, even if the claimant arranges for their direct transfer to a RRSP or purchases a RRIF. Pension legislation may require that the taxable excess be transferred to a locked in vehicle or remain within the employer's pension plan, only to be used to fund an annuity. If under the pension legislation the taxable excess is still considered locked-in and may only be used to fund an annuity, the pension credits cannot be considered payable until the annuity is actually payable (Digest 5.13.4; Digest 5.13.5).",45.64398053892219,13.116026946107787,14.836745963215662,16.726586826347308,14.673203592814374,12.453572854291416,59.18173652694611,8.55,2.987444529013048,0.5894742525149745,0.4378924036253145,0.0576675547569369,0.8792612082079837,0.8618804646862878,5.005988023952096,4.0,2.892961392866324,25.05,26.5,8.737705648509797,1.6047904191616766,1.0,0.8887728459199992,501,163,0.3253493013972056,2568,20,5.13.11.2,Pension fund contributions in excess of CRA limitations,Chapter 5 - Earnings
324,324,"Pensions and pension credits have been considered a marital asset in court cases dealing with marital dissolution. As such, the ownership of the pension may be divided between the spouses, like any other form of marital asset or property.Like property, the right to a pension can be legally transferred from one person to another. Once the rights to a pension have been legally transferred or disposed of, the pension is no longer owned entirely by the individual who first had the right to it. Since the ownership of that pension is no longer only the claimant's, the total amount can no longer be considered their pension benefits. However, it must be a legal transfer of ownership or rights, not simply a direction by the owner that part of the moneys due them be paid to another party (Digest 5.13.12.1).This division of pension assets can occur when a couple separates or divorces. However, it can also occur under the Canada or Quebec Pension Plans while a couple is still married (Digest 5.13.12.2). The general principle used in dealing with these types of cases is the following:Once the rights to the asset (that is, the claimant's pension credits, or the pension itself) have been legally and formally assigned or transferred to the spouse, the assigned or transferred portion is no longer the claimant's pension income. The test used to determine this is not to whom the pension payments are distributed or paid, but rather who is entitled to the moneys, or who has a vested right to them.",60.67554263565893,11.917906976744188,11.20814326018867,14.257364341085273,15.02937984496124,10.789767441860466,55.41085271317829,7.666666666666667,3.105523083049965,0.5757661502082153,0.4482423107557516,0.0304840737153869,0.8959362208843231,0.8716164146150861,4.697674418604652,4.0,2.5261566578279004,28.666666666666668,23.0,12.0,1.3837209302325582,1.0,0.6379826122967092,258,119,0.4612403100775193,1246,9,5.13.12,Division of pension assets,Chapter 5 - Earnings
325,325,"In deciding on cases of marital dissolution, the courts have normally split the entitlement to the pension or the pension credits, based on co-habitation during the period the contributions were made. This may not necessarily be one-half of the claimant's pension. For the purposes of determining whether this split will have an effect on the pension earnings of the claimant, the claimant must be transferring the right to the pension, or the ownership of the pension, and not simply arranging to use the pension to satisfy a financial obligation connected with the marital dissolution. If the rights to a portion of the pension have been legally transferred to the spouse, under the terms of a separation or divorce, then that portion is no longer pension income of the claimant. The amount transferred will not constitute earnings of the spouse who receives that portion of their former spouse's pension. This is because these moneys do not arise out of the receiving spouse's pension contributions during their employment.Whether part of the pension paid or payable to a claimant is no longer their property, and whether it has become the property of their spouse, will depend on the documentation presented. This documentation should be in the form of a separation agreement, order or decree, or a divorce decree (nisi or absolute), that clearly states that the pension rights have been divided between the 2 spouses. The documentation must contain a specific reference to the division of the pension rights and not be merely an order to pay alimony or child support. An order to pay alimony or child support is a financial obligation of a claimant, which they may use their pension to satisfy. Satisfying financial obligations does not alter the fact that this money remains paid or payable, and belongs to the claimant (Digest 5.6.1).If the pension has been divided by a separation or divorce decree or agreement, then it does not matter if one payment for the full amount is issued directly to the claimant. The portion belonging to the spouse will not be earnings of the claimant, as the claimant is considered to be legally acting as a trustee only, for the spouse's portion, even if they initially receive both portions. The claimant would be legally bound to forward the spouse's portion to the former spouse. On the other hand, the fact that a pension plan administrator makes separate payments is not sufficient to prove that the pension rights have been divided, and that the amount of earnings determination should be reduced. An arrangement to have more than one payment issued may be made simply to facilitate the claimant's discharge of legal obligations to pay alimony or child support.",51.03417994100299,13.627044247787612,13.348371206891418,16.301120943952803,16.62396755162242,11.915221238938052,60.22182890855457,9.066666666666666,3.1731092653640656,0.7246656141090427,0.4488965230645008,0.0560220938469907,0.9151728536401476,0.9098336925873388,4.880530973451328,4.0,2.7303394844539164,30.133333333333333,32.0,11.904434281206123,1.4800884955752212,1.0,0.850326325257057,452,167,0.3694690265486726,2258,15,5.13.12.1,Pension split due to marital dissolution,Chapter 5 - Earnings
326,326,"A provision within the Canada and Quebec Pension Plans allows for a portion of the CPP or QPP pension that is credited to an individual, to be assigned to the pensioner's spouse. Spouses in a continuing marriage and partners in a common-law relationship may apply to receive an equal share of the retirement pension earned by both parties during their life together. On application, the spouse is normally entitled to the pension owed based on 50% of the pension credits accrued by the pensioner, during the years of co-habitation. Both spouses must be at least 60 years of age and have applied for pensions to which they were entitled under the plan.Only one spouse has to apply for this assignment. The Minister, upon request, automatically grants the assignment; however, the assignment may be appealed if it was made without the consent of the pensioner. This assignment will only be revoked by CPP under 4 specific circumstances: the death of the spouse or pensionerthe separation of the coupletheir divorce, orthe non-contributing spouse starts contributing to the fundAs well, the couple, on their own, can request that their assignment of pension be terminated at any time.If the pensioner provides written proof that such an assignment has been made, the portion of the pension that has been assigned to the spouse will not be considered income of the pensioner. In cases of these pension assignments, the portion of the pension that has been assigned is no longer legally payable to the spouse who has lost that portion of their pension entitlement. Should this spouse be on claim, it cannot be considered as earnings since this spouse is no longer legally entitled to receive the assigned portion of the pension. In addition, the assigned portion will not be considered as income of the spouse who receives it, as this pension does not arise from that person's employment, nor their own pension contributions.If the spousal assignment is subsequently revoked, the question of the allocation of pension earnings will need to be reviewed.",55.019147286821735,12.706860465116282,12.885471636013053,15.536434108527132,15.79612403100775,11.746976744186044,58.027131782945744,8.416666666666666,3.2007588823564905,0.7078967685386457,0.461142917176582,0.067695929923777,0.8904696811329235,0.8688174307346344,4.8604651162790695,4.0,2.75623095657683,28.666666666666668,30.0,9.454569735788557,1.4505813953488371,1.0,0.7608897097158966,344,151,0.438953488372093,1711,12,5.13.12.2,Spousal assignment of a CPP or QPP pension,Chapter 5 - Earnings
327,327,"Pensions are different than all other types of earnings, because they continue to be paid for life. To consider the same pension as earnings on every claim for the entire life of the claimant would result in inequities. To do so would mean that claimants who become re-employed after starting to receive a pension would pay EI premiums on that employment, but if they become unemployed may never be able to collect EI benefits, or may only be entitled to reduced benefits. Although pension income is earnings, these earnings can be exempted from allocation if all 3 of the following conditions are met (EIR 35(7)(e)):the claimant must accumulate the number of insured hours required to establish a claim (including claims for special benefits)the insurable hours must be accumulated after the date the pension became payable, andthe claimant must be receiving pension payments during the entire period they are accumulating the required insured hoursIt does not matter whether an insured hour for a pension requalifier is from fishing or regular employment. Fishing insured hours for regular claims are obtained by using a formula that converts insurable earnings to insurable hours (EIR Fishing 13). For fishing claims, it is not insured hours but insured earnings from self-employment in fishing that determines whether the pension requalifier exemption is met (EIR Fishing 2; EIR Fishing 8; EIR 35(7)e). Pension requalifier insured hours may be earned with any employer, including the employer who is paying the pension.Where a claimant is receiving more than one pension, each pension must be considered separately, for requalification. Pension start dates are critical to this determination. The same insured hours may be counted towards requalifier insured hours for more than one pension, as long as each of the pensions was paid or payable during that period.To be considered pension requalifier insured hours, the hours must be accumulated in employment held after the start date of the pension payments, or after the start date that a pension became payable. It is not essential that the claimant actually have received the pension during this period (for example, when payment is delayed due to administrative difficulties), as long as the pension was payable. It is when the insurable hours are worked in relation to when the pension is paid or became payable that is relevant (Digest 5.6.1.2). To be considered a pension requalifier insured hour, the pension payment must continue during the entire period of employment from which the claimant is accumulating the required insured hours. Some pension plans have a provision that suspends payment of a pension during any subsequent period of employment covered under the same pension plan, with the same employer, or a subsidiary of that employer. If the pension payment is suspended during a subsequent period of employment, the hours worked do not count towards meeting the pension requalifier insured hours (CUB 80755).Other pension plans may require the individual to repay the pension received and resume making pension contributions on the new employment, if they subsequently become re-employed with the same organization. Any insured hours accumulated during a period a claimant was required to repay a pension do not count towards pension requalifier insured hours.In some cases, the employer may forgo repayment of the pension received during the entire period or part of the period of re-employment, and allow the employee to restart contributing to the same pension plan. In these situations, any hours of insurable employment accumulated during the EI qualifying period, during which the claimant was re-employed and was in receipt of a pension, would count towards pension requalifier insured hours, even if they restarted contributing to the company's pension plan.The requalifier exemptions also apply to CPP and QPP retirement pensions, should the claimant start subsequent employment after pension payments start. Any insured hours accumulated during a period in which CPP or QPP was paid or payable, count as pension requalifier insured hours.A recipient may cancel their CPP or QPP pension within 6 months of the first payment. If the CPP or QPP pension is cancelled, all benefits received must be repaid, and contributions must continue to be made on any new CPP or QPP pensionable earnings. If the claimant cancels their CPP or QPP, any insured hours previously accumulated in relation to the exemption of the pension are no longer counted for this purpose. This is not the case if an early retirement CPP or QPP pension in cancelled in favour of a CPP or QPP disability pension.Insured hours accumulated during a period in which pension bridging benefits are paid or payable to bridge to a future company pension, CPP/QPP or OAS payments, meet the conditions to be considered pension requalifier insured hours. When the company's pension plan becomes payable (if not already being paid), payments under that pension are exempted as earnings, if the claimant accumulated the required insured hours while the pension bridging benefits were paid or payable.The requalifier exemption also applies to pensions that are paid in a lump sum and have been converted to an annuity. In these cases, the pension requalifier insured hours must have been accumulated after the lump sum became payable.Simply transferring pension credits from one pension plan to another cannot allow the claimant to accumulate pension requalifier insured hours. With a transfer of pension credits, no pension is paid or payable to the employee, as these credits will support the payment of a pension at a later date, when the employee retires.If a claimant has obtained a requalifier exemption of a pension amount, any subsequent increases of that pension due to indexing of the pension would also be exempt.",42.61656233500531,14.667085203273498,14.099209189292512,16.821660506863783,17.41920868532207,13.226906019007387,64.54623152059133,10.34375,3.1865992424415985,0.6453041344659085,0.4608605164885926,0.0627435527882198,0.8727624916261242,0.866565603017807,5.106652587117212,5.0,2.7791325458102563,29.59375,28.0,14.36980204934988,1.5860612460401269,1.0,0.9085630464326092,947,254,0.2682154171066526,4932,32,5.13.13,Requalifier exemption for pension earnings,Chapter 5 - Earnings
328,328,"Not all individuals are physically able to continue working until retirement age. An employer can choose to provide coverage for employees who are no longer able to work, through either a long-term disability wage-loss indemnity plan or a disability pension (Digest 5.11.2). As the purpose of a long-term disability wage-loss indemnity plan and a disability pension are somewhat similar, they share some of the same characteristics and may be difficult to differentiate at first glance. Nevertheless, the effect of each type of payments is not the same, for EI benefit purposes. Disability pensions of any kind are specifically excluded as earnings, whereas, wage-loss indemnity payments that are paid from a group plan are earnings (EIR 35(7)(a); EIR 35(2)(c)(i)). As disability pensions are not specifically defined in the legislation, the ordinarily accepted meaning is applicable. This also includes CPP/QPP disability pensions.Pension plans may provide for retirement due to disability. A retirement due to disability is not the same as taking early retirement. Disability provisions contained within a pension plan are designed to provide income support when an individual can no longer work due to a disability, but cannot otherwise qualify for a retirement pension.The amount of a disability pension is often equal to the regular pension accumulated up to the date of the disability, without the actuarial reduction that is often made when early retirement is taken for non-disability reasons. However, some pension plans may provide a disability pension based on both past and prospective service. In these cases, the pension is equal to what the employee would have received, had the employee stayed employed until normal retirement age, at their present salary.Another approach is to integrate a deferred pension with a long-term wage-loss indemnity plan, should one exist, allowing the employee to accumulate pension service credits for the entire period of the disability. This allows the employee to receive long-term disability payments until normal retirement age, and then receive a pension based on the years of actual work, plus the years of disability.The distinction between a disability pension and disability wage-loss indemnity benefit may seem difficult to draw. Both are likely to terminate should the disability terminate, and both are designed to replace income that the individual could have earned had the disabling disease or accident not occurred. However, a disability pension generally has the following characteristics (CUB 45917):it is a periodic payment made as compensation for what is expected to be a permanent disabilitypayments are likely to last over a long period of time, usually the lifetime of the employee\t\t\t\tthis period may not be as long depending on the length of the employment with the employerthis is unlike long-term disability indemnity payments which usually cover an individual for 24 months, for not being able to work in their own occupationafter the first 2 years, the plan may only continue to pay if the employee is unable to perform any occupation for which the employee is qualified through education, training, and experiencethere is no requirement for the individual to look for and accept work that the individual may be able to performthe provision for the disability pension is usually contained in the pension plan itself, and is distinct from early retirementthe amount of the pension is not reduced should the individual obtain other employment or receive any other amounts designed to replace wagesit is not necessary that the employee have retired from all employment, just that they are retiring from that particular occupation, at that particular employer. The individual is not precluded from working as long as they can find work that they are able to dothe amount paid is related to the individual's past years of service or prospective years of service, in the same fashion as an ordinary pension, and is not based on the individual's current salary. There are some disability pensions that are hybrid plans, combining the features of a disability pension with a top-up amount that is more in line with a wage-loss indemnity paymentit is paid beyond age 65, or it may switch to a regular pension at that timeany unpaid benefits at death are paid to the spousethere is usually no requirement for a waiting period, or integration with other wage-loss benefits, although it may take some time for the assessment process to be completed, andit can be likened to permanent settlement workers' compensation paymentsIn certain cases, a person may have the option of receiving a lump-sum payment in lieu of periodic payments. When lump-sum payments are substituted for the periodic payments the claimant would be entitled to under a pension plan, this sum is treated as a disability pension.Disability pensions, which convert to retirement pensions at a specified age, under the terms of the pension plan, no longer have the character of a disability pension. These pensions have become retirement pensions. As such, they are considered as earnings from the date they are converted to the retirement pension and are allocated, unless the claimant meets the pension requalifier conditions (Digest 5.13.13).Since it is the nature of the pension that has changed, and not the pension plan source, nor the period paid, any insured hours accumulated while in receipt of the disability pension count towards pension requalifier insured hours and the exemption of the retirement pension.In some pension plans, for those individuals who can establish that they are disabled, indexing may be paid at an earlier age than it normally would. In these cases, the indexed amount is not considered as earnings as it qualifies as a disability pension. This exemption continues until the age that the indexing would normally commence, at which time the indexed amount would be considered as earnings.",35.51931464174456,17.165690550363454,17.165536196952242,21.03717549325026,20.44732087227414,13.386791277258563,68.5846313603323,11.74074074074074,3.328960543347913,1.0155644727007451,0.4453701487042578,0.0730425726740401,0.8656092056861291,0.8707473993301391,5.104880581516095,4.0,2.930203488350796,35.666666666666664,27.0,38.88444419044716,1.5970924195223262,1.0,0.9524913273820226,963,316,0.328141225337487,5022,27,5.13.14,Disability pensions,Chapter 5 - Earnings

330,330,"A bonus is defined as something which is given in addition to what is expected or strictly due, or given in addition to an employee's usual compensation; an incentive to employees to provide efficient and faithful service. A gratuity is defined as something given voluntarily or beyond obligation, usually in return for or in anticipation of some form of service. While there is a voluntary element in both these definitions, in modern business usage the terms have broadened to include amounts that could be included in the terms of a collective agreement. In addition, bonuses and gratuities have become, in many cases, an incentive to ensure employees provide good service (production bonuses), or do something (signing bonuses). Consequently, a bonus or gratuity is not necessarily an unsolicited and unexpected gift from employer to employee. Both the terms, bonus and gratuity, are often used interchangeably in practice.There is usually no question that bonuses and gratuities are earnings when they are paid by employers, since these amounts are clearly income arising out of employment (EIR 35(2)). This is true even if the person who pays the bonus is representing  the employer, such as a receiver in bankruptcy proceedings. However, gratuities that are gifts from an employer to an employee because of their personal relationship or friendship, rather than the employer-employee relationship, do not arise out of employment. The personal relationship is prompting the gift, and not the employment relationship (Digest 5.3.1.5). The giving of a wedding gift to an employee when it is not the employer's practice to do so, for example, may be more closely linked to a friendship between the employer and the employee, than to the employment relationship.Someone other than an employer, such as a customer, may give gratuities. If a connection is established between the employment, the work performed, and the reason for the gratuitous payment, the gratuity is considered to arise out of employment. This is the case when a customer tips a server (Digest 5.14.7). However, if the gratuity given is not related to the work performed or the services provided, such as due to a personal relationship or friendship, the gratuity cannot be said to be arising out of employment. In this situation, the relationship itself prompted the payment, and not the services performed by the claimant.The allocation of bonuses and gratuities is governed by whether the payment is more closely linked to the services performed, or to a particular event or transaction. In other words, the reason for the payment. Some specific allocation situations are as follows:bonuses and gratuities which have a specific link to measurable production goals and the services required to meet those goals, are allocated to the period in which those services were performed (EIR 36(4))bonuses and gratuities most closely linked to a holiday or non-working day are allocated to the week in which the holiday occurred (EIR 36(13))bonuses and gratuities paid or payable by reason of a lay-off or separation should be allocated from the date of the event, either the lay-off or the separation, which gave right to the payment (EIR 36(9); EIR 36(10))bonuses or gratuities to which none of the other subsections apply are allocated to the period in which the services are performed or to the week of the event or transaction (EIR 36(19))",43.72435698762169,14.443516961164132,15.970245054697788,18.620391193423416,16.752526693754135,12.558635547576298,61.8113011433431,9.526315789473683,3.170295227173504,0.8841041558605519,0.4656723978414383,0.0716671737573629,0.8211113876766629,0.848223048097947,4.994614003590664,4.0,2.9964023437124285,29.31578947368421,25.0,26.56680285338105,1.5763016157989227,1.0,0.9067938086256664,557,203,0.3644524236983842,2862,19,5.14.0,Bonuses gratuities and tips,Chapter 5 - Earnings
331,331,"Production bonuses are paid when workers meet or exceed specified levels of production, sales or service. All types of industries employ these bonuses as a form of incentive to maintain or increase productivity. Production bonuses may be part of the employment contract, either by custom or by an explicit written policy or collective agreement. Production bonuses may also be paid unexpectedly because of a particularly good year. The central factor is that they are based on exceeding specific work levels, during a specific period, and performance of either the individual, or the individual's work unit.The calculation of production bonuses may be based on a formula related to individual or group performance, during a specified period. It may be based on the hours worked, the amount of work performed, or any other measurable criteria that suits the industry, the company, the job, or the situation (FCA A-600-92, CUB 20966). It may be paid regularly as part of the employee's salary, or in a lump sum periodically or annually, as the employer is able to pay.As production bonuses are directly related to the amount of work performed in a specified period, they are allocated as any payments made under a contract of employment for the performance of services (EIR 36(4)). This allocation should be in proportion to the amount of work performed, sales made, or service provided in each week. If they are paid with every pay cheque, or periodically on a regular basis, then they are allocated in proportion to the amount of work performed, sales made, or service provided in each week. If the amount of work performed weekly is unknown, which is often the case when production bonuses are paid annually, then the earnings should be allocated evenly over all the weeks of the period for which the bonus is being paid.",55.98779411764707,11.785065359477128,13.81666964889586,15.690196078431374,14.02343137254902,11.382352941176467,52.29738562091504,6.833333333333333,2.9756996827649,0.7199444741091091,0.4636965892400674,0.0610223950159465,0.8910727826031771,0.8974975228309632,4.8202614379084965,4.0,2.793031933693314,25.5,23.5,8.51958527942137,1.477124183006536,1.0,0.8010203241753481,306,132,0.4313725490196078,1520,12,5.14.1,Production bonuses,Chapter 5 - Earnings
332,332,"Shift bonuses or premiums, are normally small amounts paid for each hour worked on a specified shift, or they may be paid in lump sums per shift. This type of bonus is common in the mining or manufacturing sector of the economy. They are usually paid to encourage participation on evening or night shifts that may be viewed as less desirable than straight days. They are also paid as an incentive for workers to accept shift rotation in a work schedule.Shift bonuses usually form part of the written contract of employment and therefore the exact terms and conditions of entitlement to this bonus will virtually always pre-exist the period for which they are paid. They form a basic part of the pre-established rates of wages or salary under a contract of employment for the performance of service. These moneys are allocated to the period in which the services were performed (EIR 36(4)).",64.82838709677422,9.717972350230417,11.20814326018867,12.47004608294931,11.6416866359447,10.328516129032256,44.07834101382488,4.857142857142857,3.1663630276616552,0.7221113757273331,0.4408754332953418,0.0525677217612206,0.8021019101142883,0.8129335045814514,4.670967741935484,4.0,2.5579973956942905,22.142857142857142,22.0,6.770283206327306,1.4129032258064516,1.0,0.7601960424080224,155,91,0.5870967741935483,738,7,5.14.2,Shift bonuses or shift premiums,Chapter 5 - Earnings
333,333,"Event bonuses are paid on the occasion of certain events, such as holidays, service anniversaries, fiscal or calendar year ends, or the signing of collective agreements. These bonuses may be cash or a non-pecuniary gift like a Christmas turkey or a retirement gift (Digest 5.3.2.1). They are usually lump-sum amounts, rather than based on a formula related to the period or conditions of employment. The most common types of event bonuses are Christmas bonuses, signing bonuses, a good-year bonus, or a cash or gift given as a length of service award.Event bonuses are usually flat, fixed lump-sum payments, with no grading in the method of calculation. They may be gratuitous, unexpected and unsolicited expressions by the employer, or there may be a custom, or even a written employer's policy, that governs their payment. In relatively rare cases, they may be included in a collective agreement, as the result of employer-employee negotiations.Whether an event bonus is paid regularly, (for example, annually at Christmas), or is an isolated occurrence (for example, only when an employee has worked 25 years with that employer), it is paid primarily because of the event. This is the basic distinction between this type of bonus and a production bonus. Although it can be said that employers generally want to reward only good, productive employees, an event bonus lacks the specific link to measurable production goals and the services required to meet those goals. As there is no specific link to the services performed, an event bonus is allocated to the week of the event that caused the payment to be made.If the event is a holiday or non-working day, the bonus would be allocated to the week in which that event occurred (that is, the week in which the holiday or non-working day falls) (EIR 36(13)). If there is another type of event, such as an anniversary payment in which there is only a vague and subjective  reference to services (for example, 10 years of service), then the bonus is allocated to the week in which the anniversary date occurred (EIR 36(19)(b)).",55.94186257562664,12.259662921348315,13.639024540459548,15.897666378565257,14.304049265341405,10.6361797752809,54.35090751944684,7.384615384615385,3.095496685503698,0.6469797149606376,0.4552001196811855,0.069429254962984,0.8405342300732931,0.8441632823510603,4.679775280898877,4.0,2.640168524382823,27.384615384615383,27.0,9.2946507489189,1.4550561797752808,1.0,0.7575108907816585,356,160,0.449438202247191,1732,13,5.14.3,Event bonuses,Chapter 5 - Earnings
334,334,"A signing bonus is a type of event bonus, triggered by the signing of a collective agreement. However, the terms of the collective agreement must be examined to ensure the bonus is in fact being paid for this reason. Signing bonuses are sometimes offered by the employer as a result of the employment contract negotiation process. This most commonly occurs when a collective agreement has taken some time to negotiate. The employer may agree to pay all regular employees a set amount of money in lieu of a retroactive wage increase or a set amount as an incentive to sign. The amount is often the same for all regular employees regardless of the wage, the job, the employee's position or the number of hours worked. This lump sum saves the employer the expense and trouble of calculating a wage increase for the prior period. The employer may prorate the signing bonus in some manner for part-time or temporary employees.The language in a collective agreement may not specifically refer to signing bonuses.  It is imperative that the terms and conditions of the agreement be examined to determine the real nature of the payment. More often than not, regardless of the name given to this payment, its principal purpose is as an incentive to promote the ratification of the collective agreement by the workers. These signing bonuses can usually only be paid when the contract is ratified by the membership, or signed and finalized. Often the collective agreement may contain 2 parts: the Central Agreement (part I) and local agreements (part II).  In these cases, the signing bonuses do not become payable until both parts of the agreement have been ratified. Signing bonuses are considered paid by reason of an event or transaction (ratification of the contract) and are therefore allocated to the week of that event or transaction (CUB 77513).",57.539039403620905,10.417648562300318,12.573866699077325,13.586283280085198,11.575218317358896,10.960383386581466,50.25963791267306,6.133333333333334,2.890206955603185,0.4249596971475032,0.453865042602236,0.0695500628162649,0.8373932540416718,0.8565043898729178,4.792332268370607,4.0,2.7583747573051607,20.866666666666667,19.0,5.339995838533543,1.5143769968051115,1.0,0.8076813805616648,313,139,0.4440894568690096,1533,15,5.14.3.1,Signing bonus,Chapter 5 - Earnings
335,335,"A good-year bonus is also an event bonus. This type of bonus generally recognizes the overall productivity of the company rather than the work of an individual or of a group of workers. The good-year bonus is usually calculated at the end of the calendar or fiscal year when the books are audited, and it is known what the profitability of the company was in the previous year. The premise of a good-year bonus is that if the company had a good year, all the workers were good employees, and should share in the good fortunes of the company. If the good-year bonus can be directly linked to the amount of work performed by the individual, or by the company as a whole (for example, a percentage of the profits paid to the workers), then the bonus would be a productivity bonus, and allocated to the period in which the services were performed (EIR 36(4); Digest 5.14.1). A lump-sum payment that is not based on any formula related to the profitability of the company, or any other measurable criteria, cannot be directly related to the employee's work. Such a bonus is more related to a transaction, whether that is the finalization of the company books, or a decision to reward the employees for a good year.Occasionally there is an extra condition of payment, such as a return to work. If a bonus would never be paid if the employee did not return to work, or if any condition for payment was not fulfilled, then the event is the fulfilment of all the required conditions. The bonus is allocated to the week of that event (for example, a return to work) (EIR 36(19)(b)).",59.23714013840832,12.176501730103803,12.516099999999998,15.297024221453288,13.359377162629762,8.567612456747408,50.35328719723184,6.2,3.313448570127406,0.7685184851912618,0.445449855434937,0.0447885385131344,0.8465869161817763,0.8489628285169601,4.318339100346021,4.0,2.582019811534428,28.9,30.5,13.284953895290718,1.397923875432526,1.0,0.7561483952169264,289,110,0.3806228373702422,1291,10,5.14.3.2,Good-year bonus,Chapter 5 - Earnings
336,336,"End-of-season bonuses are paid to workers who agree to, and actually do, work for the full term of the contract period, or who complete a certain amount of work within a specified period. End-of-season bonuses are common in seasonal industries where the season is very short. The main purpose of this kind of bonus is to offer employees a strong incentive to stay with the employer until they are no longer needed and to not leave early. If an employee leaves early for any reason, voluntary or not, all or a significant portion of the bonus is usually lost. The monetary impact of not fulfilling the terms required for payment of a bonus may be a negative incentive or deterrent.The terms and conditions for end-of-season bonuses should be known when the offer of employment is accepted. Therefore, it is an express condition of the employment and may be considered a contractual right of the employee. The amount of an end-of-season bonus may simply be a fixed lump-sum payment, it may be a type of wage increase in relation to the total number of hours or days worked, or it may relate in some manner to the work performed.Its predominant link is to the services performed rather than to the time of payment even though an entitling condition for receipt of the bonus is that the employee completes the term of duty, and thus fulfils the terms of the contract. In other words, the end-of-season bonus is not payable until the end of the season (Digest 5.6.1).An end-of-season bonus is compensation for the performance of services under a contract of employment. It is therefore, allocated equally or proportionately to the period in which the services are performed (EIR 36(4)).",58.5377497749775,11.937545754575464,12.24349002098031,14.714551455145518,13.40559855985598,9.420462046204616,48.997599759976,5.909090909090909,3.0547298553391298,0.5079064290379927,0.4534561998516496,0.0567662709748224,0.8748088777065277,0.8697893420855204,4.471947194719472,4.0,2.5944288822271413,27.545454545454547,22.0,10.183441429047598,1.4224422442244224,1.0,0.7034272364838504,303,137,0.4521452145214521,1394,11,5.14.4,End-of-season bonuses,Chapter 5 - Earnings
337,337,"Separation and retirement bonuses may be given to an employee upon the termination of employment, in recognition of years of faithful service. In other words, these bonuses would not be paid if it were not for the lay-off or separation. This would be an amount over and above other earnings that may be paid at the time of a separation from employment, such as wages in lieu of notice or severance pay.While separation bonuses are for the purpose of recognizing and rewarding good service, the payment is not directly related to meeting or exceeding objective production goals. It is therefore not a production bonus to be allocated over the period in which the services were performed. Separation or retirement bonuses are paid or payable by reason of a lay-off or separation. They are therefore allocated from the week of the lay-off or separation, along with any other termination earnings.(EIR 36(9); EIR 36(10); Digest 5.12.4).",52.20601265822785,11.585009041591324,13.925175675911133,15.357685352622063,12.481600361663652,11.134936708860756,49.7866184448463,6.142857142857143,2.9025316187080894,0.8995804273308627,0.4644863248329635,0.100770061732276,0.8293946087360382,0.8402212738990784,4.80379746835443,4.0,2.862810119753971,22.571428571428573,22.0,4.952838806674205,1.5569620253164558,1.0,0.9174377562170672,158,86,0.5443037974683544,779,7,5.14.5,Separation and retirement bonuses,Chapter 5 - Earnings
338,338,"A closure or loyalty bonus is usually announced as a part of a closure agreement. Typically, a condition of payment is that the worker is on staff when the closure is announced and remains working until all production or cleanup is finished. This is often referred to as a retention bonus (CUB 73014).  Closure bonuses are offered as an incentive to maintain production levels, complete necessary orders for shipment before closure, or prevent sabotage during the final weeks of a company's operation. However, in any work situation, the employer normally expects that an employee will remain on the job as long as required, and any employee who quits often forfeits the right to any severance pay. Therefore, by making the payment of a closure bonus conditional upon staying, the employer is only reinforcing a normally accepted condition of employment. This type of bonus is normally paid at the time of, or just prior to, the closure date.Employers often call these bonuses a production bonus, but the link to production is usually general and vague, with no measurable conditions of payment except that the claimant forfeits payment by leaving before the closure date (CUB 26019). If a direct relationship between the right to the money and the production levels can be established, then the bonus would be allocated over the period from the time the closure was announced to the date of closure (FCA A-600-92, CUB 20966).Whenever a bonus is paid to employees, the reason for the payment must be examined. If the company has set no objective productivity goals except to maintain production, then the bonus, especially if paid just prior to, or at the time of the closure, is considered to be paid or payable by reason of the separation.  It is then allocated with any other termination earnings, from the date of the separation (CUB 57342). The onus is on the claimant to prove that earnings paid at the time of separation are not payable by reason of that separation.",49.752500000000026,13.275833333333336,13.5591,15.961904761904762,14.99857142857143,11.142857142857142,57.76190476190476,8.333333333333334,3.285257128499812,0.5911462776457894,0.4571516486004033,0.0584248779226038,0.8739450194618918,0.8839861989021301,4.761904761904762,4.0,2.741302469452239,28.0,25.5,12.45659129403653,1.5208333333333333,1.0,0.7712354163679969,336,149,0.4434523809523809,1640,12,5.14.6,Closure bonus,Chapter 5 - Earnings
339,339,"Customers give workers gratuities in recognition of service provided and work performed by the worker. Gratuities may be in either pecuniary or non-pecuniary form. They are normally received directly from the customer, and may be shared by employees. A flat-rate service charge added to a customers' bill, is not considered freely given by the customer. It is an additional charge levied by the employer, and forms part of the employees' agreed upon wage compensation package under the contract of employment. The employer is charging more for a product or service, and agrees to turn the additional amount charged, over to the employees. This amount is part of the employees' compensation under the contract of employment, and is allocated to the period in which the services were performed (EIR 36(4)).As gratuities are paid by customers to workers, in recognition of the service provided or work performed, these moneys are part of the entire income arising out of employment (EIR 35(2)). If the gratuity is given due to a personal relationship rather than for the service or work performed, it does not arise out of employment, and is not earnings for EI benefit purposes.Gratuities from customers for services provided or work performed are allocated either to the period in which the services are performed or to the week in which the transaction is made, depending on which one is appropriate (EIR 36(19)).If the claimant did not keep a record of the amounts and dates of the tips received, an average weekly amount may be determined based on the claimant's own experience.

341,341,"Cash or current distribution profit sharing plans are designed to provide periodic cash distribution to plan members, based on the profits of the employer. Occasionally company stock may be distributed, rather than cash and the employer determines the distribution schedule. As the distribution is made periodically, rather than being held until the participant leaves employment, this plan is a form of direct compensation.This is the simplest form of profit sharing plans. It does not require registration with the CRA as all profit sharing payments are made directly to the employee in cash or stock certificates. Taxation is not deferred, and occurs in the year that these moneys are paid.Any cash, or the value of any stock distributed to the employees, is earnings arising out of employment (EIR 35(2)). Like all profit sharing plans, the payment of these moneys is linked to the services provided by the employees in their daily work, that assist the company in earning profits.

342,342,"In an employee's profit sharing plan, a share of the company's yearly profits is placed in a trust fund and is allocated to participating employees, along with their share of the fund's accumulated interest for that year. The allocation may be in proportion to the employee's earnings, length of service, or another formula.Generally, these moneys remain in the trust account until the participant's employment is terminated. However, some plans may allow cash withdrawals by the employee, while still employed. Employees may also contribute to this fund, although these contributions are not tax deductible.Vesting (full ownership rights) of the employer's profit sharing contributions can vary from immediate, to vesting only on death, termination of employment, or retirement. In cases where vesting is not immediate, cash withdrawals cannot be made while employed, as the employee has no right to these payments.Although a participant may not normally receive a distribution from this trust fund until retirement or until employment is terminated, the employee is taxed each year on their share of the profits, the interest accruing in the trust, and any realized capital gains, as though they were in immediate receipt of the moneys. There is no income tax payable on any employee contributions made to this fund, as these moneys come from the employee's after-tax income. This type of profit sharing plan is registered under section 144 of the Income Tax Act.These moneys are earnings that arise out of employment (EIR 35(2)). However, they are not considered as payable until their actual distribution to the employee. Like all profit sharing plans, the payment of these earnings is linked to the services provided by the employees in their daily work, that assist the employer in earning profits.

343,343,"In a deferred profit sharing plan (DPSP), the employer allocates a share of the profits to all participating employees each year, and places it in a trust account. These moneys remain in this trust account until the participant's employment is terminated. Employees cannot contribute into this plan, except for direct transfers from other registered tax-assisted plans.Income tax is not deducted from the employee's share of the profits and the interest accrued in the trust fund, until the employee receives these moneys. These plans are registered under section 147 of the Income Tax Act, and are subject to greater regulation and control than an employee's profit sharing plans (Digest 5.15.2).Although a DPSP may have some of the same characteristics of a pension plan, it does have some important differences. A DPSP may allow for withdrawal of all or part of an employee's account (including the vested employer share) while still in active employment. This is not the case under a pension plan. The entire withdrawal above the employee's own contributions is taxed as income. At termination or retirement, lump-sum payments out of a DPSP are similarly taxed as income, but may be tax-sheltered if an annuity is purchased, or all or some of the payment is transferred to an individual RRSP. Unlike a DPSP, a pension plan does not normally make payment available as a lump sum at termination or retirement (Digest 5.13.0).These moneys are earnings that arise out of employment (EIR 35(2)), however, they are not considered payable until their actual distribution to the employee. Like all profit sharing plans, the payment of these earnings is linked to the services provided by the employees through their work, which assists the company in earning these profits.

344,344,"A registered profit sharing pension plan is a pension plan in which employer contributions are linked to profits. The provisions of these plans are the same as other pension plans, and they are subject to the same pension legislation as all other plans. The profit sharing aspect of the pension plan is solely a method of funding. Any moneys placed in the fund must remain there until retirement or termination of employment.As with all other pension plans, profit sharing pension plans are registered under section 147.1 of the Income Tax Act. Employee and employer contributions are tax deductible (to a maximum amount that is the same as for other pension plans.) but the interest income of the trust fund is not. That being said, all benefits are taxable when paid out.Because they are most often locked-in, these benefits are normally only paid in the form of annuities at retirement. In exceptional circumstances, lump-sum payments may be made provided the following conditions are met: the contributions have not been locked-inthe annuity amount due is below a set limitthere is a shorter than normal life expectancypartial commutation is allowed by legislationAdditional Voluntary Contributions (AVCs) are being returned, andcontributions are being refunded under the maximum funding by employee provisionsPayments made from a registered profit sharing pension plan are earnings because they have all the characteristics of a pension that arises out of employment (EIR 35(1); EIR 35(2)(e)).

347,347,"Self-employment may be defined as being engaged in labour or work on one's own behalf, rather than being employed by someone else under a contract of service. Self-employment includes situations where a claimant works alone as an independent worker or contractor, as well as where the claimant engages in a business activity on their own behalf, or is engaged in the operation of a business as a partnership or co-adventure. Self-employment also includes being engaged in the operation of a business as a corporation (EIR 30(5)). Self-employment involves working and striving to achieve a profitable financial enterprise. The efforts of a self-employed person are part of what makes a business run.People who have only invested in a business and who are not personally engaged in self-employment, expect profits through the efforts of the people who are running the business (for example, a business operator, promoter or a third party who is acting on the owner's behalf). Generally, those not engaged in self-employment benefit from the results of the business operation through ownership, and not through labour, work, or effort on their part, in achieving those results.For self-employment to exist, there must be involvement in activities which are designed to generate income from providing a product, offering a service, or involvement in the managing of individuals who attempt to generate income. As long as there is a finding that the claimant is engaged in the operation of a business (for example, there is participation, labour, or work by the claimant) moneys resulting from that self-employment are earnings for EI benefit purposes (EIR 35(2)).",46.563815896188174,14.327858880778589,14.554592549557764,17.433252230332524,16.96404703974047,12.155620437956204,64.02108678021087,10.22222222222222,3.4839042334166543,1.024737415238261,0.4479151242392645,0.0404093509097548,0.8814568668603897,0.8481946587562561,4.91970802919708,4.0,2.824704349003378,30.444444444444443,31.0,12.65008661464516,1.5291970802919708,1.0,0.8156015722538843,274,120,0.437956204379562,1398,9,5.16.1,Self-employment,Chapter 5 - Earnings

349,349,"Regardless of the nature of the business, once there is a finding that the claimant is engaged in the operation of a business, any moneys arising from that business are earnings for EI benefit purposes, unless the claimant sells the business or permanently withdraws from its operation.It is not the mere ownership of a business that leads to a finding of being self-employed. Rather it is a determination that the claimant is engaged in the operation of that business, which renders the claimant self-employed. If a claimant takes no part in the operation of the business, or if the activities performed by the claimant are in the nature of exhibiting a natural concern for an investment, there can be no self-employment or any earnings from self-employment, (Digest 5.3.1.6).  When a claimant temporarily ceases to take an active part in the operation of the business during periods when the business continues to operate,  it does not mean they are no longer engaged in the operation of the business (Digest 4.6.10, Digest 24).

350,350,"Claimants may lend a hand in a business owned by someone they know. This does not mean that every claimant who provides assistance in connection with a business enterprise, is self-employed on their own account, in a partnership or co-adventure, or employed in an employer-employee relationship. The status of the claimant must be assessed in relation to the business, to determine whether the claimant is an employee, owner or co-adventurer, or simply someone assisting another.If a claimant is simply assisting another person, without expectation of any benefit, profit, or financial or economic advantage from the work, either immediate or eventual, and solely because of a friendship or family relationship, then there is neither an employer-employee relationship nor self-employment. If employment of any kind does not exist, there cannot be any earnings as a result of the assistance given. However, if there is any hope or promise of some sort of a financial remuneration in a business, the claimant may not be working totally out of disinterest, and earnings may be considered for EI benefit purposes (Digest 4.6.9, Digest 5.3.1.6). In addition, if it is determined that no actual employment exists, the claimant's availability should be reviewed, taking into consideration the time the claimant is spending providing assistance to the business enterprise (Digest 10).",41.1909049773756,15.35724628312864,17.122413403193683,20.230381383322563,18.331958629605687,13.194570135746602,66.8655462184874,11.142857142857142,3.355091972983114,0.7899385575846805,0.4352519841962509,0.0490551271736665,0.9242444038391112,0.8957843899726867,5.090497737556561,4.0,3.032396753229928,31.571428571428573,34.0,10.567566862232532,1.579185520361991,1.0,0.9071467211686276,221,120,0.5429864253393665,1164,7,5.16.2.2,Assisting a business enterprise,Chapter 5 - Earnings
351,351,"Engagement in the operation of a business, which includes operating a corporation, falls into the category of being self-employed. Any income arising from that self-employment is earnings for EI benefit purposes.Income received from owning shares in a corporation is not treated as earnings for EI benefit purposes if it does not arise out of employment, (that is, the claimant takes no part in the operation of the corporation) (Digest 4.6.3, Digest 5.3.1.6). However, a claimant who owns shares in a corporation could also work for that corporation as an employee under a contract of service, or may be engaged in operating that corporation as a business on their own account, or in a co-adventure (FCA A-296-86, CUB 12019). Some claimants may be paid as employees, but also perform additional functions for which wages or salaries are not paid.When a claimant is receiving any income from a corporation, it must be determined whether that income is from employment stemming from an employer-employee relationship, from the claimant's self-employment activities in operating a business, or merely from an investment in that business.Income from a corporation is normally earned through the payment of wages or salaries, if the claimant is working for the corporation as an employee. Wages and salary arising out of contracts of employment with corporations are earnings for EI benefit purposes, as they arise directly out of employment.If the claimant owns shares in a corporation, income may also arise through the payment of dividends. Dividends are paid to shareholders to provide a return on the shareholder's investment in the corporation. Directors of corporations decide if or when dividends are declared in a particular year. Additionally, there may be an increase in the value of the claimant's holdings in the corporation, if the net income earned during a specific period, is held by the corporation and not distributed to shareholders as dividends. Determining the claimant's role(s) in the corporation will reveal the type of income they receive.Employees of a corporation may also be shareholders; that is, they are not benefiting from the corporation's profit, other than by virtue of an investment they have made, in order to receive dividends from shares or stocks. As employees, in addition to being shareholders, they hold a position in the organization, as do other workers; they are paid wages or salary, in return for their work. It cannot be concluded therefore, that persons working for a corporation, who also happen to hold shares of the same corporation, are self-employed.The situation is not the same when it is determined that shareholders are engaged in operating a corporation as a business. A determination must be made as to the extent to which a shareholder is engaged in the operation of a business (Digest 4.6.3). While engaged in operating a corporation as a business, a shareholder may receive wages or salary from the corporation for only a portion of the hours worked, or they may not be compensated for the work at all, as an employee would. Payment received for any work performed under a contract of service is earnings from employment, however, it must be determined whether earnings arise from any work performed in operating the corporation, without payment.Although there is no provision in the EI legislation to attribute a value to work performed without wages or salary, any income arising out of self-employment is earnings for EI benefit purposes (EIR 35(1)(b)).Claimants who are shareholders engaged in operating a business as a corporation have argued that due to the corporation's status as a separate legal entity, the net income of the corporation belongs to the corporation, and should not be considered earnings of the claimant. However, claimants who are self-employed in operating a business on their own account, as a sole proprietor, or in a partnership or co-adventure, have their share of the income allocated as earnings. If the claimant's share of the income of a corporation was not considered as earnings, it would give an unfair advantage to those who choose to operate their business through the corporate form of business structure, over those who do so in a partnership or as a sole proprietorship.To remove inequities in the treatment of earnings based on the structure of a business, one must pierce the corporate veil by looking beyond the fact that the business is a corporation, in order to consider earnings arising from self-employment in a corporation (Digest 4.6.8). The legal status of the operation or business in which the self-employed person works, is irrelevant (FCA A-136-96, CUB 31814, FCA A-296-86, CUB 12019).When the corporate veil is pierced, the claimant's engagement in the operation of the corporation is examined and any income from that self-employment is treated as earnings. The claimant's share of the earnings arising from that self-employment must be determined.If there has been a determination that the claimant is self-employed, the fact that they did not actually receive the income is not relevant; the mere right to receive such income is sufficient (FCA A-136-96, CUB 31814). This applies equally to the farming sector, where, through the piercing of the corporate veil, farming transactions and subsidies of the corporation become the claimant's (Digest 5.16.9; Digest 5.16.2.5). Therefore, payment does not have to have been issued for a determination that the moneys are part of the entire income arising out of self-employment. The definition of income includes income that is received, or to be received from an employer or any other person (EIR 35(1)).For those who work in self-employment, including farming, the net income from self-employment is the amount remaining after deducting the operating expenses, other than capital expenditures, from the gross income from that employment (EIR 35(10)). Since the claimant only has a right to their share of the net income of a corporation, it is this amount that is determined as earnings for EI benefit purposes, when the corporate veil is pierced.Once it has been determined that the claimant is engaged in self-employment, all income from that self-employment is earnings. There is no provision to attribute only a portion of self-employed income as arising from the investment the claimant made in the business (EIR 35(10)). This is true whether the claimant is self-employed and operating their business as a sole proprietorship, through a partnership, co-adventure or corporation.In a corporate situation, the claimant's portion of the income of the corporation is based on the claimant's investment in the corporation, which is represented by the percentage of shares owned. Piercing the corporate veil may be required to determine the claimant's share of income.The claimant's share of the self-employment income is earnings. The claimant cannot assign any portion of that income to any other person, unless that person has a legal right to claim a share of the income from the business (CUB 31091). As well, the income cannot be excluded as earnings, should the claimant's share of the net income of the business be left within the business to meet current or future business obligations.",47.722500000000025,14.055833333333336,14.69652957618502,17.466666666666665,16.762825,12.167433333333328,59.41666666666667,8.825,3.288279549793117,0.8290068711645919,0.4648343391212096,0.0543668246390102,0.886138488084842,0.8862414501215282,4.924166666666666,4.0,2.957772129867719,30.0,27.0,13.605146085213493,1.5208333333333333,1.0,0.8866976028437705,1200,281,0.2341666666666666,6107,40,5.16.2.3,Working in a corporation in which shares are owned,Chapter 5 - Earnings
352,352,"When the claimant is self-employed in operating a business with others, it is only the claimant's portion of the income from that business that is considered their earnings. In partnerships, the portion of the earnings that are considered the claimant's share of the income are based on the terms of the partnership agreement. A partnership agreement may set out a percentage under which the net profits of the partnership are to be shared, which may be different than the percentage owned. In that case, the claimant's share of the net income is the percentage of net profits and not the percentage of ownership.Once there is a finding that the claimant is self-employed, all income arising from that self-employment and its activities must be considered. There is no requirement by law, that earnings be analyzed further to determine what portion of the self-employment income arose from investment, versus the self-employment itself. A portion of the claimant's income from self-employment cannot be excluded from consideration as earnings on the basis that it was earned from an investment and not the labour of the claimant (CUB 31090). However, as already mentioned, moneys received from investments that do not arise out of the claimant's self-employment activities, and meet the criteria for investment income, are not considered arising out of employment (Digest 5.16.2.3).Once it has been determined that the claimant is involved in self-employment, the claimant's share of the income is based on the claimant's entitlement according to ownership, or the terms of the partnership agreement, regardless of the extent of the claimant's personal involvement, work, or participation (CUB 59511).",50.12037500000002,14.80825,15.414825405933506,19.131818181818183,19.46164545454545,12.931345454545458,64.19318181818181,10.25,3.4409448036420773,0.4589175478833018,0.4626502496785854,0.0348139556645907,0.901985628264291,0.9206476112206776,5.032727272727273,4.0,2.9509354168993167,34.375,28.0,18.794530454363574,1.44,1.0,0.7856902003392247,275,107,0.3890909090909091,1437,8,5.16.2.4,The claimant's share of income from self-employment,Chapter 5 - Earnings
353,353,"According to Black's Law Dictionary, a subsidy may be defined as a grant of money made by a government in aid of the promoters of any enterprise, work or improvement in which the government desires to participate, or which is considered a proper subject for government aid, because such purpose is likely to be of benefit to the public.The definition of the word subsidy is broad enough that it could include all government moneys paid to farmers with a particular goal in mind. However, it is the moneys or advantages that are earned by labour, or resemble them, that are earnings for EI benefit purposes (FCA A-178-86). Moneys must clearly display the character of a consideration given in return for work done by the recipient in order to be considered earnings (FCA A-597-94, CUB 25472).Therefore, all income support subsidies, intended to compensate for lost income, are considered when determining the income of a farmer. When considering subsidies for EI benefit purposes, it is the reason for the payment which determines whether or not they are earnings.An income support subsidy includes any subsidy that pays for differences in the price for which goods are sold and a minimum price level for the product (that is, price subsidy), or any subsidy that guarantees the individual's income level (that is, income subsidy).An income support subsidy does not include:a subsidy to cover the cost of courses designed to increase the knowledge level of the farmerany subsidy (using the broadest meaning of the word) that pays a farmer not to farmgrants received from the government to partly absorb the cost of farming implementsany subsidy which is compensating for a decrease in the market value of the land",32.12110046457612,20.66221254355401,15.903189008614271,23.314518002322885,25.380220673635318,12.161672473867592,76.75319396051104,13.833333333333334,3.152645712338509,0.5389831163588117,0.5048940348728485,0.0453102703429111,0.879521107673645,0.9093328416347504,4.860627177700349,4.0,2.8422062191216853,47.833333333333336,36.5,30.15193010221549,1.4912891986062715,1.0,0.7780262327217448,287,136,0.4738675958188153,1430,6,5.16.2.5,Federal or provincial farming income subsidies,Chapter 5 - Earnings
354,354,"Payments may be received from customers or clients as deposits or advance payments on services to be rendered, items to be provided, or sales to be made. These payments are earnings for EI benefit purposes.An advance may be defined as money paid before it is due, or a loan. A business operator may receive an advance from the business on the wages or salary due to them, or on the business operator's share of the profits. A company may also pay advances based on anticipated sales of products. An advance is a payment for something, before entitlement to that payment is earned, such as:an advance on wages or salaryan advance on commissions before the right to them has occurredan advance on sales or services before the right to that payment exists under the terms of the sales contract, oran advance taken by business owners on their share of the net income of the businessAdvances must be repaid. Normally, the repayment of the advanced amount occurs when the product is sold, or when the wage, salary, commission or share of the profits is earned and payable. If the right to the expected payment does not occur, the person who receives the advance must still repay it.The situation is slightly different when an advance against business profits, is received. Earnings from self-employment are the amount of the gross income from that employment, remaining after deducting the operating expenses. Therefore, the claimant should be declaring earnings as they are earned by the business, and not when the claimant is to receive their share of the net income. Rather than considering the advance as part of the gross income of the claimant, the Commission considers the claimant's share of the income that the business earned during the relevant period, whether the claimant receives their share or not (FCA A-136-96, CUB 31814).Like a loan or advance, a draw is not part of the claimant's gross income. A draw by a business owner is a lawful withdrawal of an amount from the business, against the equity that the business owner holds in the business. Rather than considering the draw as part of the gross income of the claimant, the claimant's share of the income that the business earned during the relevant period is considered, whether the claimant receives their share or not (FCA A-136-96, CUB 31814).",61.47954545454546,11.711125541125543,10.7630783206399,13.83953823953824,14.94262987012987,10.905353535353536,55.30591630591631,7.642857142857143,3.379049164748865,0.8498401924913248,0.4671022530536218,0.0654417087575154,0.8525293927926284,0.8578019291162491,4.71969696969697,4.0,2.535548455222005,28.285714285714285,27.0,17.047951579624588,1.378787878787879,1.0,0.6651152747772112,396,140,0.3535353535353535,1922,14,5.16.2.6,Advances or draws,Chapter 5 - Earnings

356,356,"Land ownership is a personal asset. For example, a person who is self-employed may receive moneys by virtue of ownership of land rather than as a result of their business. Income arising from other sources, such as renting unused land to others, selling mineral rights or receiving royalties from those mineral rights, is not income for EI benefit purposes. This income results from land ownership and not from self-employment. As has been previously stated in this chapter, for earnings to exist, the income must have come from work performed (Digest 5.16.1).As well, a person who is self-employed and owns the premises where the self-employment business is located, may rent space on their property, to a third party. Likewise, a self-employed person may generate income by renting a private basement apartment in their home. Rental income by virtue of land ownership is not earnings when there is no correlation between the payment of moneys and actual employment. This should not be confused with income from rental properties, when such rentals are part of the self-employment activity.

358,358,"Insurance may be defined as a contract whereby, for a stipulated consideration, one party undertakes to compensate the other for a specific type of loss. A farmer may purchase insurance against loss or price fluctuations of crops or livestock. A business owner may purchase insurance to protect against financial losses of their product through theft, fire or other damage.Moneys paid according to the terms of an insurance policy are paid to compensate for the loss of a business asset. As a result, these moneys are not considered to be earnings arising out of employment. In the same fashion, moneys paid under an insurance policy for a loss due to price fluctuations (in the case of farming) are not considered to be earnings arising out of employment. While for the farming sector, federal or provincial governments may assist in the payment of premiums, that does not change the fact that the proceeds paid from an insurance policy are paid solely for that insured loss. Payments from an insurance policy are not in the nature of a grant and thus cannot be considered a subsidy. A grant is the bestowal or gift of land or money. This gift or bestowal may be given in exchange for some sort of compensation paid by the recipient. A grant may also be given, conditional on the production of a service or a product (Digest 5.3.1.7).Additionally, the payment of a portion of the premiums by a provincial or federal government is not considered an income-support subsidy.",61.7730039525692,10.357075098814231,12.563389971838223,13.94308300395257,12.391304347826086,10.7791304347826,50.66798418972332,6.363636363636363,2.7204250092091358,0.6706456772740875,0.503701503800012,0.0783766802425415,0.878396886587143,0.8740173578262329,4.739130434782608,4.0,2.978700812836677,23.0,21.0,8.883078909313532,1.4387351778656126,1.0,0.7656158110863716,253,111,0.4387351778656126,1223,11,5.16.3.3,Payments under an insurance policy,Chapter 5 - Earnings

The general principle in determining the income and expenses of a self-employed person is that income should be matched with the expenses incurred in earning that income.Expenditures made in the course of pursuing self-employment are spent in one of 2 categories: they either constitute operating expenses, or capital expenditures. The classification into which an expenditure falls depends on whether the expenditure is made for an item which is exhausted while earning the revenue for which it was incurred (that is, an operating expense), or for the purchase of an asset which continues to exist, and will benefit future operating periods of the business (that is, a capital expenditure).

361,361,"Operating expenses are the cost of operating a business, such as rent, wages, utilities, and similar day-to-day expenses, as well as taxes, insurance, and a reserve for depreciation (Black's Law Dictionary). As reported on the business' income statement, these expenses occur from delivering or producing goods, rendering services, or carrying out other activities that constitute the business entity's ongoing major or central operations.Operating expenses are the specific expenses and costs associated with a company's main activities to benefit a finite period as they are spent to obtain the revenue  earned in that period. They are deducted from the income earned over the same  period of time that the expenses were incurred. There are 2 types of  operating expenses, ongoing and job-specific, which may vary depending on the  type of business.Ongoing expenses represent the cost of doing business and occur on a regular basis whether income is generated or not. These may include rent, insurance, wages or  salary for regular employees, licenses, and utilities. They may also include similar  day-to-day expenses such as supplies, property, sales and other taxes paid by  the business, advertising expenses, interest on business loans, maintenance or  repair costs, workers' compensation assessment fees, payroll taxes, and  depreciation. Entertainment expenses are also operating expenses where they are  required to obtain and maintain clientele or customers. Lawyer and accounting fees are also  considered operating expenses, unless these amounts are part of the start-up  costs of a business, in which case they are a capital expenditure.Job-specific operating expenses represent the cost associated with a particular activity of the business, that is, a specific product, job, sale, or work performed.  Job-specific operating expenses are costs such as additional wages or salary  for employees hired for that work, transportation expenses and materials.Operating expenses include only those expenses relating to the business and not expenses incurred for personal or family reasons. For example, bank charges applicable to the business are operating expenses. However, if the claimant is using a personal chequing account with a flat monthly service fee, to pay business expenses along with personal ones, this is not an operating expense. Operating expenses may also include costs incurred because the business operates out of the claimant's household; however, it must be demonstrated that these costs are in addition to the claimant's normal household expenses.In a partnership, operating expenses may vary and are not necessarily split evenly between the partners. The percentage is based on the partnership agreement. Where one partner has removed themselves from the business for a temporary period of time, and an operating expense is incurred by hiring a replacement worker, only a percentage of that expense may be deducted from that partner's earnings. For example, if there are 2 equal partners, 50% of the cost of the replacement worker's wage may be deducted as an operating expense for the partner who is temporarily away from work. The cost of the replacement worker is an expense of the business, not the individual they are replacing.",44.65672413793106,13.20581828133552,14.889722007359984,16.76278051450465,15.180180623973726,13.197701149425283,60.68089764641489,8.904761904761905,3.0319852309212045,0.6253655814830771,0.4707448278665995,0.056278603921845,0.8911389499902725,0.8706687155522799,5.134099616858237,4.0,2.837425384040936,24.857142857142858,23.0,9.15103800662195,1.6187739463601531,1.0,0.8982059762213094,522,198,0.3793103448275862,2758,21,5.16.5.1,Operating expenses,Chapter 5 - Earnings
362,362,"Capital expenditures (or balance sheet expenditures) are spent to acquire or to improve assets. An asset is a financial contract or physical object with value, that is owned by an individual or company, and which can be used to generate additional value or provide liquidity (Black's Law Dictionary). The assets benefit the business over one or more reporting periods, beyond the period of acquisition or improvement. A reporting period is usually one year. The asset is used, or will be used, to earn not only revenue in the current reporting period, but also revenue in future reporting periods. Capital expenditures are items such as the purchase of land, buildings, equipment such as computers and vehicles, the repayment of the principal amount on a loan, and the cost to purchase a franchise.A capital expenditure is not an operating expense. Deducting the entire cost of an asset from the income for a specific period when the asset will be used beyond that period distorts the match of revenue and expenses. This gives an erroneous picture of the earnings gained for that period, for EI benefit purposes.While the total cost for the purchase or improvement of assets cannot be deducted from gross income, capital expenditures made for the purchase/acquirement of assets with a limited life span, (for example, equipment and buildings), do have an operating expense associated with them. The operating expense most often associated with fixed assets is known as depreciation.Depreciation expenses or costs arise from capital expenditures on buildings and equipment, and represent the loss or reduction in their value, over their lifetime. Vehicle depreciation is a common expense of this nature. As long as the method chosen to calculate the depreciation is credible and reasonable, it is accepted as an operating expense.The purchase of inventory is a capital expenditure and not an operating expense. An inventory is goods held for sale or lease, raw materials, work in progress, or materials consumed in a business. In accounting inventory, it can also refer to the segment of financial statements reflecting the value of the business' raw materials, work in progress, and finished goods. However, if the inventory items are sold, the original cost of purchasing the item being sold may be deducted from the sales revenue, as well as the purchase price of any item lost, stolen, damaged or destroyed.",50.20254935138186,11.694890016920478,14.314028922438442,15.760631697687536,13.016627185561198,12.188020304568523,53.107163000564015,6.833333333333333,3.010883291536434,0.7941795113082668,0.4647823064563305,0.0423892144559982,0.8335055884192971,0.8311716616153717,4.98984771573604,4.0,2.809501369701152,21.88888888888889,20.5,10.524515765524106,1.5888324873096449,1.0,0.8746150174747118,394,169,0.4289340101522843,2023,18,5.16.5.2,Capital expenditures,Chapter 5 - Earnings
363,363,"The entire income arising from any employment is earnings (EIR 35(2)). Self-employment on one's own account or in a partnership or co-adventure is included in the meaning of employment (EIR 35(1)(b)).EIR 35(10)(c) clarifies how self-employment income is calculated. Income includes the amount of the gross income from that employment, remaining after deducting the operating expenses, other than capital expenditures, incurred therein (EIR 35(10)(b) and (c)). The characterization of the expense must be based on the end product for which the expense was incurred (that is, providing a product or offering service) and not when the expense was incurred (FCA A-423-11; CUB 77802).In other words, on-going operating expenses (for example, salary and rent) and job-specific operating expenses (for example, the purchase of specific materials needed to accomplish the job) are applied to the period in which the work is performed to generate revenue.For example, a snow clearing business may operate during a limited yearly window, but some expenses, such as vehicle maintenance, may only occur after the season is over. Since those expenses occurred to generate income during the winter season, they should be linked to this period. To calculate earnings, the method chosen should be one that most accurately matches expenses with the income that those expenses generated. In some cases, the use of annual statements may be preferable to relying on monthly statements. The former will include all actual expenditures incurred in the fiscal year (such as depreciation), and fixed costs (such as rent). Earnings for a particular week may be estimated by using monthly financial statements, invoices, or any other accounting documents. Adjustments may be required upon receipt of the year-end statement.Earnings considered for EI benefit purposes, including those arising from self-employment, are determined and allocated on a weekly basis since the week is the basic period used in the legislation. If a weekly breakdown of actual gross income and operating expenses is not possible, the income may be calculated using other methods, such as averaging.If gross income is known on a week-by-week basis but exact operating expenses are difficult to determine, or operating expenses vary widely week to week, income may be calculated by deducting a percentage for the operating expenses. The percentage that the operating expenses absorb of the gross income may be used if such an average is known.If the exact weekly gross income cannot be determined, an average income based on the total gross earnings, after deducting operating expenses for the period in question, may be used. This method should not be used in cases where the claimant is not engaged in self-employment for a considerable time in the applicable period, unless there is no information as to when the actual work was performed (CUB 70120).These methods are used when difficulties arise in determining income, and not only when it is more advantageous to a claimant whose income widely fluctuates over the period of operation (CUB 79773).",45.64897913474008,14.18430036543676,15.207996813670285,17.83336083932571,17.174025698455736,13.062925851703405,58.81185901214193,8.647058823529411,3.3304506911763947,0.9680710870845448,0.4506868901689873,0.0475598999918436,0.8549062944948673,0.8459695259730021,5.080160320641283,4.0,2.7873150925575487,29.352941176470587,25.0,18.37498675940488,1.5531062124248498,1.0,0.8556574490306542,499,204,0.4088176352705411,2618,17,5.16.6,Calculation of self-employment earnings,Chapter 5 - Earnings
364,364,"Once calculated, the reason the earnings were paid must be examined in order to determine the period to which they will be allocated. It must be verified whether the earnings arose from the performance of services or were paid as the result of a transaction (Digest 5.16.8; Digest 5.16.9). The type of  contractual arrangements entered into with customers or clients determines which applies. Contractual arrangements of self-employment are either service contracts or sales contracts, and these contracts may be express or implied. According to Black's Law Dictionary:An express contract is an actual agreement of the parties, the terms of which are openly uttered or declared at the time of making it, being stated in distinct  and explicit language, either orally or in writing An implied contract is inferred by the law as a matter of reason and justice, from the act or conduct of the parties. An implied contract may arise where one party, without being requested to do so, renders services under circumstances indicating that they expect to be paid thereof, and the other party knowing the circumstances, avails themselves of the benefit of those services. An implied contract is an agreement that can be legitimately inferred from the intention of the parties, as evidenced by circumstances and the ordinary course of dealing and common understandingOnce the determination is made with respect to the  nature of the agreement giving rise to the earnings (performance of services or transaction), allocation of these moneys can proceed pursuant to EIR 36.",41.77271653543309,16.447255343082116,15.151101081350806,19.39617547806525,20.55955005624297,13.154645669291334,68.17547806524185,11.571428571428571,3.2762121727785813,0.5645221206728237,0.4730565412585522,0.045657168145185,0.8754450579484304,0.8811893105506897,5.062992125984252,4.0,2.9980256797292366,36.285714285714285,26.0,19.344355291212292,1.515748031496063,1.0,0.7922782058150475,254,130,0.5118110236220472,1311,7,5.16.7,Allocation of self-employment earnings,Chapter 5 - Earnings

368,368,"A transaction is a business deal or a sale that arises from the activities of self-employment. A transaction includes the sale of many types of goods and products, including farming products (for example, crops, wood, livestock, eggs, grain, honey, fruit, vegetables, flowers, tobacco, etc.), products built from hand (for example, art, furniture, housing, clothing), but can also stem from services that may not fall as cleanly into the categories mentioned. For example, real estate commission earnings resulting from the sale of a home are transactional-based where, if not for the sale of the home, the earnings would not have been received. Thus, it is the transaction of the purchase and sale, which is considered earnings for EI benefit purposes.A sales contract is an agreement under which the seller agrees to convey title to property upon payment by a buyer, under terms of the contract.

369,369,"A transaction occurs when a sale is considered complete, that is, when the buyer purchases the product and a right to payment for that product exists. It does not matter whether the payment for the transaction is immediate or deferred. This applies to all transactions arising from self-employment, including farming transactions.It is the terms of the sales contract that determines when ownership is transferred and the sales transaction is complete. A transaction may occur on payment of a deposit or the full price for the item, or only upon delivery of the product to the customer. A transaction also occurs when a customer who backs out of a deal forfeits a deposit.A transaction occurs when a claimant delivers a product and receives a payment that is immediately negotiable. This includes cash tickets issued to farmers. A cash ticket is a negotiable instrument and is considered the same as the receipt of cash or a cheque. A transaction occurs in the week that delivery is made, even if the claimant agrees to defer payment for the product to a later date. Although a payment may be deferred, the product is still considered sold and the transaction complete, as the product no longer belongs to the claimant.Deliveries made to a company, marketing-type board or agency may result in a set price for the product delivered. If the final price obtained for this product is greater than the initial price paid by the board or agency, the claimant receives the difference. In this circumstance, the transaction occurs when the initial sale or delivery is made. Any subsequent payment based on the difference in price is considered a transaction in the week that the original delivery was made and the product purchased by the marketing board.A transaction does not occur when a person delivers a product to a company, board, or agency for later sale, when market conditions are more favourable. It is not considered a sale or a transaction if the item is just delivered to a company, marketing board or storage agency, and no payment for the product is received, but a receipt or a storage ticket is issued instead. A storage ticket is a receipt issued to the farmer, recording the amount, type, and quantity of grain accepted for storage.A transaction does not occur if a claimant holds products awaiting a more favourable price, or delivers products for later sale, and receives an advance against the amount to be received when the products are finally sold (Digest 5.16.2.6). This advance is not a transaction as no sale or purchase has occurred, and may never occur. This type of payment is in the nature of a loan that the claimant must repay, using the eventual sale of the product. A loan received by a claimant is not earnings for EI benefit purposes, as it is not income arising out of employment, and must be repaid at a later date. A transaction occurs in the week of the sale of the product, if and when that sale ever occurs.If the claimant receives payment from a company, marketing board or agency representing an estimate of the amount of products sold over a specific period, but the exact dates of the sales are unknown or cannot be reasonably ascertained, the transaction may be considered to occur when the payment is made.",63.60180125368733,10.236559734513277,12.161744961471694,13.664454277286138,12.33194837758112,10.396530973451329,52.03724188790561,6.708333333333333,3.0591789235131706,0.6583253228254231,0.490297953362317,0.0575241025328046,0.8600834167521932,0.8700617551803589,4.669026548672567,4.0,2.7763565494296034,23.541666666666668,22.0,9.69956685745411,1.4106194690265488,1.0,0.7048960046134976,565,172,0.3044247787610619,2695,24,5.16.9.2,Determining when a transaction occurs,Chapter 5 - Earnings
370,370,"Earnings arising from a transaction are generally allocated to the specific weeks where the work that resulted in the transaction, was performed. This is done in a manner that is proportional to the amount of work performed during each of those weeks. This includes earnings from profits or commissions, which exceed the maximum yearly insurable earnings in effect at the time of the transaction, divided by 52.An exception applies when earnings stemming from a transaction are less than or equal to the maximum yearly insurable earnings in effect at the time of the transaction, divided by 52. Those earnings are allocated to the week in which the transaction occurred. If the claimant indicates, however, that the work which gave rise to the transaction was performed in more than one week, then the earnings are allocated to the specific weeks where the work was performed, in a manner that is proportional to the amount of work performed during each of those weeks.It is important to note that although EIR 36(7)(a) differentiates between farming transactions and non-farming transactions, the allocation of earnings stemming from all transactions (farming or not) is the same, with the exception of farming subsidies. Subsidies are always allocated to the week in which the subsidy was paid (EIR 36(7)(b)).In all cases where no work was performed, the earnings are allocated to the week of the transaction.",48.42413043478264,14.667763975155278,15.532846611407376,18.88198757763975,18.773832298136647,12.980347826086955,63.29192546583851,10.0,3.2513055548164504,1.0622851430736595,0.5115391543166489,0.0736328570988246,0.9173383514086404,0.9190083980560304,5.047826086956522,4.0,2.912099133109757,32.857142857142854,32.0,15.084794344244912,1.4782608695652173,1.0,0.7950698748286927,230,87,0.3782608695652174,1184,7,5.16.9.3,Allocation of earnings arising from a transaction,Chapter 5 - Earnings

These earnings are to be allocated in a manner that accurately and fairly reflects the work performed. Accordingly, in situations where the work was performed over a period that includes partial weeks, the earnings are to be allocated proportionally. For example, if a transaction occurred on a Tuesday, earnings would be pro-rated to obtain daily earnings, resulting in 3 days' worth of earnings being allocated to the week of the transaction.

375,375,"The purpose of the Employment Insurance system has long been described as an insurance scheme which is in place to compensate persons whose employment has terminated involuntarily and who are without work.As part of this system, provisions exist within the legislation that limit the payments in circumstances where claimants voluntarily place themselves in a position of unemployment. Accordingly, the legislation provides for claimants to be disqualified from receiving benefits if they have voluntarily left their employment without just cause.The adjudication of voluntary leaving is a two-fold process. The burden is on the Canada Employment Insurance Commission to show that the leaving was voluntary. The Commission also has the obligation to consider all possible applicable circumstances. Once the voluntary nature of the leaving has been established, the onus shifts to the claimant to demonstrate just cause for so leaving. Consequently, the adjudicator must first determine that the reason for separation was in fact voluntary leaving. Once this has been established, it must be determined if just cause is present.On the surface, it would appear that voluntary leaving would be easy to identify. In most cases this is true, but situations exist where the circumstances surrounding the reason for separation may not be straightforward. For this reason, the importance of thorough fact-finding with all interested parties cannot be over-emphasized.The claimant and the employer must have an equal opportunity to provide information. The information obtained from both parties will ensure that the facts of the situation on file are as comprehensive as possible. Final rebuttal must always be given to the claimant. There must be no allegations on file that have not been presented to the claimant with an opportunity for explanation or clarification.Each case must be adjudicated on its own merits and all circumstances relevant to the reason for separation must be considered in order to make a fair decision in accordance with the Act, Regulations and Jurisprudence.This Chapter will define voluntary leaving, discuss circumstances where it is at times difficult to determine whether or not the reason for separation is one of voluntary leaving, explain the legal test for just cause, discuss the considerations that must be made and illustrate how to apply the legislation and the principles issued from jurisprudence given certain voluntary leaving circumstances.Report navigationPrevious part of reportTable of contentsNext part of report",46.51849433710859,11.935616255829451,14.629514614951471,16.113257828114595,14.458357095269823,14.602632911392408,53.19453697534977,6.7368421052631575,2.649278502214693,0.6074867011627001,0.4623406316398794,0.0921209255981422,0.8444903327359093,0.8352822030291838,5.412658227848102,4.0,3.2769763420694598,20.789473684210527,18.0,11.664516356379927,1.6455696202531649,1.0,1.0340772769833373,395,183,0.4632911392405063,2171,19,6.1.0,Introduction,Chapter 6 - Voluntarily leaving employment

379,379,"Simply put, voluntarily leaving means that the claimant and not the employer took the initiative in terminating the employer-employee relationship.Subsection 29(a) of the Employment Insurance Act defines employment to be considered for the purposes of sections 30 to 33. It states:29. For the purposes of sections 30 to 33, employment refers to any employment of the claimant within their qualifying period or their benefit period;Therefore, these provisions apply where a claimant leaves any employment, whether the employment is insurable or not. The only exception to this is where the non insurable employment is for employment under a contract for service which means the claimant is self-employed in the operation of a business that provides a service without setting up an employer-employee relationship.Subsection 29 (b.1) of the Employment Insurance Act states:(b.1) voluntarily leaving an employment includesthe refusal of employment offered as an alternative to an anticipated loss of employment, in which case the voluntary leaving occurs when the loss of employment occurs,the refusal to resume an employment, in which case the voluntary leaving occurs when the employment is supposed to be resumed, andthe refusal to continue in an employment after the work, undertaking or business of the employer is transferred to another employer, in which case the voluntary leaving occurs when the work, undertaking or business is transferred;Subsection 30(1) of the Employment Insurance Act states:A claimant is disqualified from receiving any benefits if the claimant lost any employment because of their misconduct or voluntarily left any employment without just cause, unlessthe claimant has, since losing or leaving the employment, been employed in insurable employment for the number of hours required by section 7 or 7.1 to qualify to receive benefits; orthe claimant is disentitled under sections 31 of the Act to 33 of the Act in relation to the employmentSubsection 30(7) clarifies that any employment referred to in EIA 30(1) means that even though a claimant may not have lost or left their last employment voluntarily, they may still be disqualified due to their separation from another employment. It also stipulates that the claim need not be an initial claim for benefits.The question to be asked is, Did the employee have a choice to stay or leave?    Even though a voluntary separation generally results in a final severance of the employment relationship, this is not always the case. A temporary separation may exist as in the case of a leave of absence taken from employment. These situations are also considered voluntary leaving but are dealt with under a different section of the Act. In situations where individuals take a leave of absence from a job but fail to prove they had just cause for so doing, they would be subject to a disentitlement pursuant to section 32 of the Act.Additionally, voluntary leaving that occurs within 3 weeks of the employment's scheduled end date is dealt with under section 33 of the Act    .When dealing with the issue of voluntary leaving, one must distinguish whether the employee truly left their employment voluntarily or whether instead the separation was a form of veiled dismissal. This is called constructive dismissal.How can one determine whether a loss of employment amounts to constructive dismissal? The phrase constructive dismissal refers to situations where the employer has not directly fired the employee. This question can be one of the more difficult ones to recognize when looking at the reasons for separation. It may look at first glance like the claimant quit their employment but upon further fact finding the information shows that rather than fire the employee, the employer made the situation so intolerable that the claimant had no alternative but to quit   .Whether or not the separation is voluntary can often be a complex issue with some cases being more straightforward than others. Circumstances may exist at times which make it difficult to conclude whether or not the case is one of voluntary leaving. The following sections illustrate various situations which may be encountered.",38.48264925373135,16.214104477611944,17.637676136203027,21.101492537313437,19.67843283582089,13.725671641791044,66.63432835820896,11.1,2.647405308204106,0.7631317114437396,0.454127246778541,0.0740776164434834,0.792406522913983,0.7910212725400925,5.1716417910447765,4.0,3.1474370511718464,33.5,19.5,45.0804835821445,1.5880597014925373,1.0,0.9209862312905532,670,248,0.3701492537313433,3512,20,6.3.0,Voluntary leaving defined,Chapter 6 - Voluntarily leaving employment
380,380,"There are situations where it may be difficult to determine if the loss of employment was due to misconduct or voluntary leaving   .The notions of dismissal for misconduct and voluntarily leaving may be two distinct abstract notions, but they are dealt with under the same section of the Act. In each case, the claimant has acted in such a manner that loss of employment resulted. These two notions are rationally linked together because they both refer to situations where loss of employment results from a deliberate action of the employee. The two notions have also been linked for very practical reasons: it is often unclear from the contradictory evidence, especially for the Commission, whether the unemployment results from the employee's own misconduct or from the employee's decision to leave voluntarily. In the end, since the legal issue is a disqualification under subsection 30(1) of the Act, the finding can be based on either or both of the two grounds for disqualification as long as it is supported by the evidence. There is no prejudice to a claimant in so doing   .These notions may also become a mixed issue in specific circumstances where the voluntary leaving is the result of misconduct when, for instance, following the loss of their driver's licence, a claimant left rather than being laid off or when a claimant quit their job after being sentenced to a federal penitentiary and did not want to advise their employer of the situation because they preferred not to be fired   .This does not mean the adjudicator may simply determine the loss of employment somehow resulted from the claimant's own actions. The Commission must gather and evaluate the facts. The final decision must reflect the facts considered and why a determination of dismissal due to misconduct, or voluntary separation without just cause, is more valid. It would involve who initiated the act of severing the employment and the reasons behind this decision.Should it be determined that the reason for separation is dismissal, then the guidance in Chapter 7 of the Digest should be followed.",45.844029342415496,14.701776264081744,15.308715981407026,18.381870578988732,17.58053707099817,12.27193083573487,60.65208278752947,9.181818181818182,3.375692058435005,1.3852742794193451,0.4655377292231591,0.055157887819821,0.8877885222434998,0.8911213941044278,4.933717579250721,4.0,2.884658568303224,31.545454545454547,25.0,24.02409259042656,1.5244956772334295,1.0,0.8894867651138637,347,171,0.4927953890489913,1738,11,6.3.1,Voluntary leaving versus misconduct,Chapter 6 - Voluntarily leaving employment
381,381,"Whenever a claimant requests a lay-off from their employer, for example when a claimant voluntarily opts to be laid off to allow younger employees to continue working or even as per a clause in the union agreement, when a claimant accepts to leave his employment for what he terms inverse seniority , this nevertheless constitutes voluntarily leaving employment. It does not matter if the request for lay-off preserved the employment of someone else. The argument that one employee had to be laid off in any event and that the Commission should not concern itself with identifying which employee was to have been laid off does not alter the voluntary nature of the separation.However, under an employer's work force reduction process, an employee could voluntarily leave their employment thereby preserving the employment of a co-worker. The subject of work-force reduction processes will be discussed in more detail later in the chapter   .Additionally, a lay-off resulting from a request to have one's employee status changed from permanent to seasonal or because of a decision to work only until a replacement is obtained also amounts to voluntarily leaving employment. In these cases, the claimant surrenders full time permanent employment for a known risk of unemployment.",41.08775641025642,16.140576923076924,17.122413403193683,20.78974358974359,19.77035256410256,13.141923076923078,67.83974358974359,11.5,3.3906955736224025,0.6377124868318703,0.4566363401729255,0.0257819094321828,0.8794481992721558,0.8745645582675934,5.0673076923076925,4.0,2.924578941018437,34.666666666666664,31.5,17.4132771821453,1.5432692307692308,1.0,0.864943797982643,208,120,0.5769230769230769,1074,6,6.3.2,Voluntary lay-off,Chapter 6 - Voluntarily leaving employment
382,382,"When one leaves their employment in anticipation of either a lay-off or the expiration of a term of employment, this constitutes a voluntary separation. This may happen in situations where the employment was expected to terminate for a number of reasons such as a shortage of work, a seasonal shut-down, the sale of a business, or a bankruptcy. However, it does not include situations where a claimant leaves their employment in anticipation of a dismissal for misconduct.If the claimant advises that they left prior to a planned lay-off or to an expiration of a term of employment in the case of an employment for a set term, the question to be determined is the date of lay-off or the date the term expired.If the claimant leaves their employment within three weeks before the expiration of a term of employment or the expected date of lay-off in accordance to a notice already given by their employer, the separation will be adjudicated under Sections 29 and 33 of the Act. The adjudicator must still determine whether the claimant had just cause for voluntarily leaving the employment when they did. If just cause is not shown, the claimant will be disentitled from the first day the voluntary leaving takes effect (which is generally following the last day worked) up to and including the date the employment was to end i.e. until the expiration of the term of employment or the day on which the claimant was to be laid off.If however the claimant leaves their employment more than 3 weeks before the lay-off or the end of a term of employment, the separation will be adjudicated under sections 29 of the Act and 30 of the Act and they may be subject to an indefinite disqualification.",44.98033940397353,16.36362582781457,16.52667757954773,20.927814569536423,18.858344370860927,10.148476821192052,61.59105960264901,9.0,2.908578447888589,0.2834035615876865,0.4688119227643887,0.0319769714677979,0.9286565354892186,0.9063782493273416,4.546357615894039,3.0,2.9221980938884764,37.75,41.0,14.515078366994786,1.4602649006622517,1.0,0.9189383069318876,302,120,0.3973509933774834,1398,8,6.3.3,Leaving prior to anticipated lay-off or end of term of employment,Chapter 6 - Voluntarily leaving employment
383,383,"Sometimes when an employee submits their notice of resignation to their employer, the employer may decide to release them prior to the effective date in the notice. In these situations, the separation is still considered to be voluntary unless they are dismissed for misconduct. I n recent history, there have been a number of decisions that conclude that while it may have been the claimant's action, through submitting the resignation letter, that initiated the series of events ending in their dismissal   , it was ultimately the employer's act which severed the employer-employee relationship and caused the employee to leave   .The fact that the employer shortened the notice period does not alter the fact that the claimant voluntarily terminated their employment relationship. Any applicable disqualification will be effective from the week in which the date of resignation falls.In considering the reason for the voluntary leaving, it is the circumstances which exist at the time the claimant leaves their employment that are to be considered as relevant. The circumstances that may occur after that time do not have any bearing on the reason the claimant left the employment   .When an employee submits a notice of resignation and the terms and conditions are accepted by the employer but the employee is released due to misconduct prior to the agreed upon date of resignation, and for reasons unrelated to the resignation, the separation must be considered misconduct and adjudicated according to Chapter 7.What follows is a brief description of some of the situations which may occur when a notice of resignation is tendered and how these situations should be approached.",40.97875000000002,15.928055555555556,17.267425705330172,20.759259259259263,19.814888888888888,13.746518518518512,63.00925925925925,9.875,2.8697130937608843,0.4965601823366675,0.4810307640436724,0.0602509755771894,0.8955775839941842,0.8984418908754984,5.174074074074074,4.0,3.014052592698089,33.75,25.0,21.14680826980753,1.5555555555555556,1.0,0.8833158628600797,270,126,0.4666666666666667,1411,8,6.3.4,Dismissal prior to voluntary leaving ,Chapter 6 - Voluntarily leaving employment
384,384,"There are occasions where a claimant gives the employer notice that they are leaving on a specific date and the employer advises the claimant to leave prior to that date. If the employer does not keep the claimant on the payroll for the notice period, the adjudication should be based on the voluntary leaving criteria. Any applicable disqualification however will be effective from the original date of resignation specified by the claimant to the employer.An example of this would be a claimant who submits their notice of resignation on December 15 to become effective January 1. The employer informs the claimant that their services are no longer required and they are removed from the payroll effective December 15. This is a case of voluntary leaving and the applicable disqualification would be effective January 1.This approach is applicable to cases where the claimant provides a notice of resignation for a date in the near or distant future (i.e. tenders notice January 1 and the effective date of the resignation is June 1.

390,390,"Voluntary leaving employment also includes situations where claimants:Refuse employment offered as an alternative to an anticipated loss of employment;Refuse to resume an employment; andRefuse to continue in an employment after the work, undertaking or business of the employer is transferred to another   .It is not uncommon for a person's services to be required beyond the expiry date agreed to in the initial contract. Failure to take advantage of the opportunity to continue in employment, either by extending or renewing the contract amounts to voluntarily leaving employment. Where a claimant was offered an extension at the end of her contract but refused due to failure to reach agreement on a salary increase, it was found that she had refused employment offered as an alternative to an anticipated loss of employment in which case the voluntary leaving occurred when the loss of employment occurred   .In the Armed Forces however, failure to re-enlist for a further term of service shall be regarded as voluntarily leaving with just cause. This is because employment in the Armed Forces is considered more of a calling to duty than a means of livelihood. This does not however include situations where the leaving is before the anticipated end of contract.In teaching, most contracts are renewed automatically from year to year. A teacher's decision not to renew a contract for the coming year constitutes voluntarily leaving employment.When a leave of absence is granted by an employer, it is considered that an employment exists at the end of the leave period. Failure to return to work at the end of the agreed upon leave of absence is voluntary leaving.Failure to resume employment is also voluntary leaving. The voluntary leaving occurs at the point when the employment was supposed to be resumed. To resume an employment presupposes that the claimant's employment was there to return to and this was known at the time of the lay-off. Although a recall must exist at the time of the lay-off, it does not have to be a known recall date. Nonetheless, there must be a notion that the claimant knew that they were to be recalled. This knowledge may be through an actual recall date, by seniority rights, by custom for seasonal or temporary workers, or even by a verbal arrangement with the employer. In conclusion, there must be some plan, understanding or arrangement whereby the claimant's employment is to restart some time in the future. Furthermore, the job that is available when recalled does not have to be the exact same duties, position or job.A person, who is temporarily suspended from duty as a disciplinary action, may decide to make the separation final and refuse to resume their employment. Their failure to resume their employment at the conclusion of the period of suspension is considered to be voluntary leaving   .Additionally, in a situation where the claimant will not continue in an employment after the work, undertaking or business of the employer is transferred to another employer and the new employer has offered employment with no break in service, the voluntary separation will be considered to have occurred at the point where the work or business of the employer is transferred. This could apply to cases where the company is privatized or merged with another but the employment continues within the private or merged company.

391,391,Failure to exercise seniority rights which would enable a person to continue in employment generally amounts to voluntarily leaving employment. This is true whether the employment was to continue without interruption on the same premises or at different premises.A contention that another employee would have been released is without merit. The very purpose of seniority rights is precisely to give employees with longer service the right to replace junior employees.It happens sometimes that a labour agreement contains an inverse seniority clause under which employees with longer service can be laid off first. It will be considered that the separation is voluntary for those employees who could have remained employed had they requested it or exercised their rights.,48.78483893557424,11.381974789915969,14.790194502661404,16.336694677871147,14.134397759103642,14.726386554621849,58.48879551820728,7.666666666666667,2.79496336996337,0.439031067960193,0.4313797313797314,0.0474133420508959,0.8566672086715699,0.845579519867897,5.445378151260504,5.0,2.7644121322323767,19.83333333333333,20.0,4.058598553961974,1.630252100840336,1.0,0.8683563747609754,119,81,0.680672268907563,654,6,6.3.7,Seniority rights not exercised,Chapter 6 - Voluntarily leaving employment
392,392,"Occasionally employers reach an agreement with representatives of their employees whereby the parties agree to temporarily relinquish seniority rights during layoffs. Such agreements avoid temporarily replacing staff who are skilled and experienced in a given sector of the business with employees from another sector selected solely on the basis of their seniority, but who may be less effective and may have to be trained. This allows employers to continue business activities in a viable and competitive way.Not exercising seniority rights under normal circumstances constitutes voluntary leaving. However, if the loss of employment is as a result of an agreement between the employer and the representatives of their employees to temporarily suspend seniority rights, and all the conditions described below are present, then the loss of employment will be deemed a layoff.The agreement between the parties to temporarily waive seniority rights of employees of a sector of activities must be for a limited period, applicable only during temporary lay offs; andApproval of all the employees protected by the seniority clause - not only those subject to the lay-off - is required before their representatives may negotiate with the employer; andNeither the approval nor the agreement itself can refer to specified or named individuals. It is sectors of activities that are affected by the agreement, not individuals; andOnce the seniority rights are suspended, it is essential that the lay-offs be determined by the business needs and that the individuals have no personal choice to be laid-off or not; andThese agreements or letters of agreement are not replacing the collective agreement in effect, but rather, are only temporarily suspending the provisions of the collective agreement dealing with seniority rights; andThese must be documented, bona fide agreements, which are not made to circumvent the  EI  Act or to give advantages to certain individuals.These agreements cannot be unilaterally extended by the employer. If it becomes necessary to extend the provisions, a new agreement must be re-negotiated between the parties.This situation must not be mistaken with that outlined in Section 51 of the Employment Insurance Regulations (EIR) (work force reduction) which applies to situations in which claimants have voluntarily left their employment and where there have been measures taken to permanently reduce the employer's work force and to protect the jobs of other workers   .",28.77877319587634,18.88426804123712,19.287186520377343,23.76742268041237,23.170927835051543,14.898144329896905,73.59381443298969,13.5,3.273560853910758,1.1443667195830596,0.4513051845362925,0.0714074168671873,0.8787344296773275,0.8639617338776588,5.350515463917525,4.0,3.108157663985831,38.8,32.0,28.86451108194975,1.6391752577319587,1.0,0.9598707710519052,388,183,0.4716494845360824,2111,10,6.3.7.1,Suspension of seniority rights during a temporary lay-off,Chapter 6 - Voluntarily leaving employment
393,393,"A refusal by an employee to be transferred to other premises or to accept a change in duties is considered as voluntarily leaving employment. This applies even if a transfer procedure or the transfer itself is not part of the employer's contract of service. Further, a person who will not continue in an employment upon the employing company being relocated will be regarded as voluntarily leaving employment. Thorough fact finding and consideration of all circumstances will determine if the claimant has shown just cause.This principle also applies to persons enrolled in the Canadian Forces who choose to end their contract with the Regular Force and leave their employment because of their transfer.

394,394,"Separating from employment upon an employer's invitation to do so, after having first threatened to leave, constitutes voluntarily leaving employment. Likewise, a statement made to an employer as an ultimatum that if working conditions are not changed one would cease their employment, amounts to voluntarily leaving if it results in the termination of the employment   .Cases may arise where an employee is faced with making a choice between being dismissed or complying with an employer's rule. Such an apparent dismissal is but a voluntary separation in disguise, since the employee's decision to choose the option leading to dismissal is one made on one's own.This applies in cases where the employee chooses to be dismissed rather than undergo a medical examination, subscribe to a group medical plan, pay union dues, accept a change in working hours or rather than withdraw accusations against the employer. The principle also applies in the following cases which could be subjected to the misconduct provision: the refusal to wear a tie or a cap, to work overtime, to obey an order or to forego an unauthorized leave of absence.On the other hand, when resignation is submitted as the only alternative to dismissal, the question is one of misconduct rather than voluntary separation. In such cases it may be that an individual's employment would be terminated anyway, but they wish to show quit instead of fired on their record. The true reason for separation must be clarified and adjudicated accordingly.It is uncertain in some instances whether a person in fact leaves voluntarily or whether it is actually a constructive dismissal when there are many indications that all the employer was trying to do was get rid of a particular person for one reason or another   .",42.54396416382255,14.604235494880545,16.52667757954773,19.228532423208197,16.609249146757676,12.389078498293514,59.67542662116041,8.9,3.126021404361922,0.5916335794701914,0.4669240202645375,0.0463116879466604,0.8875329229566786,0.8791098892688751,4.965870307167235,4.0,2.9452679134767825,29.3,27.0,10.724271537032246,1.5904436860068258,1.0,0.9399245527793554,293,159,0.5426621160409556,1484,10,6.3.9,Threat of resignation or of dismissal,Chapter 6 - Voluntarily leaving employment
395,395,"Instances sometimes arise where an employer and employee both agree that their relationship is to be terminated. A personality clash may exist, an employer's requirements may change, or the employee or the job may be found unsuitable.Instead of accepting immediate separation, the claimant should attempt to stay on until other work is found. Failure to do so will be regarded as a voluntary separation, unless there are indications that the employer would have refused to extend the employment relationship.In such situations where there is the option, if a claimant makes the choice to leave, they are seen to be doing so voluntarily and therefore are required to show that the situation was such that they had no other reasonable alternative but to leave their employment   .",48.6635,12.831500000000002,15.112257680678326,17.115000000000002,14.920000000000002,12.443749999999998,52.94375,7.0,2.9070138581748486,0.396712788418482,0.4100729765590446,0.0507578487122451,0.9026093930006028,0.8891372084617615,5.0,4.0,2.944804747347437,25.6,20.0,11.6721891691319,1.5625,1.0,0.9333240326917548,128,81,0.6328125,651,5,6.3.10,Separation by mutual agreement,Chapter 6 - Voluntarily leaving employment
396,396,"Situations exist where claimants resign their positions although there is no problem with either their employer or the work. Instead, the reason for voluntarily leaving may be attributable to a third party. This could be the case where a person with whom the claimant was travelling decides to leave and there exists no other means of transportation at a reasonable cost and no possibility of moving closer to the place of employment. Another example may be where claimants, under penalty of fine or expulsion, decide to abide by union rules compelling them to leave a particular employment.

397,397,"On occasion, a claimant's own actions will lead to their dismissal. In such cases, the reason for separation may be determined to be voluntary leaving. An example of this would be an employee who is attending a course of instruction and informs their employer that they will be less available for work than they were previously   . In this case, the employee is inviting the employer to terminate their employment contract. If the employer dismisses the claimant, it is considered a case of voluntary separation as the dismissal is merely the logical outcome of the claimant's deliberate act of pursuing studies thereby preventing them from being available for work.Where an employee resigned his position as a driver because he had lost his driver's licence due to non-payment of child support, the Court stated that it does not matter whether the employer or the employee took the initiative in severing the employment relations where the employment is terminated by necessity and a reprehensible act is the real cause of that termination   .In another case, where the claimant's licence was suspended due to an offence committed prior to beginning the current employment as a driver, the claimant argued that he had no reasonable alternative but to quit.

The test and circumstances in question are found in the following extract and will be discussed in detail in subsequent sections.Subsection 29(c) of the EI Act states:just cause for voluntarily leaving an employment or taking leave from an employment exists if the claimant had no reasonable alternative to leaving or taking leave, having regard to all the circumstances, including any of the following:sexual or other harassment;obligation to accompany a spouse, common-law partner or dependent child to another residence;discrimination on a prohibited ground of discrimination within the meaning of the Canadian Human Rights Act;working conditions that constitute a danger to health or safety;obligation to care for a child or a member of the immediate family;reasonable assurance of another employment in the immediate future;significant modification of terms and conditions respecting wages or salary;excessive overtime work or refusal to pay for overtime work;significant changes in work duties;antagonism with a supervisor if the claimant is not primarily responsible for the antagonism;practices of an employer that are contrary to law;discrimination with regard to employment because of membership in an association, organization or union of workers;undue pressure by an employer on the claimant to leave their employment, and;any other reasonable circumstances that are prescribed.The other reasonable circumstances referred to in EIA 29(c)(xiv) are those which are prescribed by regulation .",11.581800643086837,22.6811943040882,22.076135915942103,27.674965548920536,27.756986678915943,17.20668810289389,78.83371612310519,15.285714285714286,2.770119303883096,0.5195626348550325,0.4797774005190932,0.0445382838259782,0.8656205634276072,0.8927633881568908,5.726688102893891,4.0,4.068453054073809,44.42857142857143,21.0,56.065923296616106,1.77491961414791,1.0,1.154112419070702,311,156,0.5016077170418006,1801,7,6.4.1,A test reflecting the standards of the jurisprudence,Chapter 6 - Voluntarily leaving employment
404,404,"The test of no reasonable alternative in the legislation stems from the philosophy of the employment insurance system which is aimed primarily at protecting insured persons in situations of involuntary unemployment. A claimant who voluntarily leaves employment and wishes to receive benefits must therefore show that leaving was the only reasonable alternative under the circumstances.The definition of reasonable alternative can certainly vary from one case to another. The legislation does not ask claimants to do the impossible in establishing just cause for voluntarily leaving; all it requires is what is reasonable under the circumstances. What is required is:a determination of what the situation was that led to the voluntary separation;whether other measures or reasonable alternatives which could have remedied this situation existed and/or were exercised; andthe claimant's reasons for not using what appear to be reasonable solutions which were available.Some situations can have only a few outcomes, as in the case of a person who is being harassed by the owner of the small private company for which he or she works, or the person who is employed in a workplace where the general atmosphere is hostile and malicious toward that person. The solution to an intolerable or unacceptable situation must be one which puts an end to the situation very quickly; otherwise, the solution cannot be considered reasonable.Persons working in a non-unionized workplace, who are not permanently employed, or whose employment is precarious, are very often at the mercy of the employer when a problem arises that requires a relatively quick resolution. If, after the employee discusses the problem with the employer there is no expressed interest in helping to remedy the situation, a reasonable alternative for the employee could be to secure other employment before leaving. This alternative would not be reasonable, however, if the situation in the workplace were totally unacceptable and could not be tolerated while the person looked for other employment.A possible solution may gradually become less reasonable the longer it takes to remedy a situation that, while not intolerable, is difficult. No one should endure a difficult situation that seems to have no end or clearly will not be resolved within an acceptable period. A person does not, for example, have to put up with constant harassment from superiors or co-workers.Generally speaking, a person should not be required to take recourse that is not immediately accessible in their work environment or personal life, or is unlikely to remedy the situation within a reasonable period of time. A reasonable alternative does not include recourse that might be taken through civil or criminal court action.A reasonable alternative can in some circumstances include using agencies responsible for enforcing legislation or regulations governing labour standards, occupational safety and health, labour rights or human rights. Again, the recourse must be one that can reasonably be used and can remedy, within a reasonable time frame, a situation that might be tolerable until an investigation is conducted or a complaint or grievance is heard.Finally, a claimant may be able to cite valid grounds for not having used an alternative that at first seems reasonable, as in the case where the situation was so traumatic that all the person could think of was getting away from his or her workplace as quickly as possible. For example, a claimant is not expected to remain in a work situation in which there is a real and imminent danger of injury or death.The same may hold true in cases where a person is genuinely afraid of being judged by co-workers or of suffering the consequences that a complaint would have on their career because they have absolutely no faith in the remedy available or doubt that the remedy could change the situation for the better within a reasonable period.",42.22844309262166,15.281735478806912,15.514038796780548,18.64266875981162,18.60694662480377,13.372182103610676,61.83430141287285,9.55,2.936212327152461,0.4239938527225042,0.4474691661019209,0.0528946795086995,0.8915621763781497,0.8982679612106748,5.119309262166405,4.0,3.030699153079405,31.85,28.0,11.976122076866115,1.5635792778649922,1.0,0.8794488062978388,637,265,0.4160125588697017,3314,20,6.4.2,A crucial test: no reasonable alternative but to leave,Chapter 6 - Voluntarily leaving employment
405,405,"Reasonable alternatives vary depending on whether the problem arises from the work environment or the employee's personal life. When the problem is caused by staff relations, working conditions or relations with co-workers, for example, it is generally expected that the insured person will not spontaneously quit their job before using any reasonable alternatives that would remedy the situation.Depending on the circumstances, these reasonable alternatives could include:discussing the situation with the employer or the union and requesting redress or adjustments;using the collective agreement or employment contract;requesting a transfer to other duties, another division, or working under someone else's supervision;using the labour standards, occupational safety and health, labour rights or human rights legislation or regulations.If a person claims to have left their employment because the available reasonable alternatives did not lead to a satisfactory solution, it is up to the claimant to show that the option of remaining in the job was not a reasonable alternative in view of all the circumstances and that ultimately the decision to leave was the only reasonable alternative they had left.Problems, constraints and decisions related to the employee's personal life can also have an impact on their job. These may be the product of personal choices made by the employee, such as a desire to take courses on their own initiative or to change their place of residence. Problems may also be dictated or imposed by events, such as illness in the family or no longer having a caregiver for a child.It is generally expected that personal choices made by an employee will not compromise their employment. It may be difficult for a person who voluntarily leaves employment because of circumstances resulting from a personal choice to be able to fulfill the legislative test of no reasonable alternative.For example, where a claimant has voluntarily left employment to attend a course, the Court has long held that this action does not prove just cause. Although it goes without saying that in most cases claimants who choose to attend courses do so for excellent personal reasons, these reasons however do not constitute just cause for leaving an employment within the meaning of sections 29 of the EI Act and 30 of the EI Act.The case law has consistently held that leaving one's employment in order to return to school or attend courses is contrary to the very principles underlying the unemployment insurance system for that employee to be able to impose the economic burden of their decision on contributors to the fund.However, claimants who leave an employment to take a course on the recommendation of an authority designated by the Commission, or provinces/territories who have entered into a Labour Market Development Agreement with the Government of Canada, are considered to have just cause for leaving that employment provided he or she leaves within a reasonable period.Another example of the impact of a personal choice might be an insured person who wants to live out in the countryside and resigns because of difficulty in finding adequate transportation to get to work. A reasonable alternative in that instance would be not making the deliberate personal choice that leads the person to voluntarily quit their job.When the circumstances do not result from a personal choice but are dictated or imposed by events, the person is expected to use the reasonable alternatives available to remedy the circumstances so that they can continue in their employment.Depending on the circumstances, reasonable alternatives could include:requesting a change of work schedule or work days;living closer to the workplace for the amount of time required to find another mode of transportation or to find a solution at work or among acquaintances;remaining in the place of residence while the spouse is temporarily absent from the region;seeking a solution to child care among family or acquaintances;requesting leave until an adequate solution is found.It should be noted that the test for no reasonable alternative should not be confused with whether a claimant acted reasonably in leaving their employment. Good cause is not synonymous with just cause.Therefore, although a claimant may have good reason for leaving their employment, this may not be sufficient to establish just cause. Personal choices do not provide a claimant with just cause for leaving employment. Accordingly, reasons such as dissatisfaction with remuneration or leaving one's employment to return to school or to find a better job may qualify as good reasons for voluntarily leaving, but they do not constitute just cause. However, personal circumstances over which a claimant has no control may be considered just cause for voluntary separation when the claimant has exhausted any reasonable alternative before quitting.",38.22683931461739,16.341595133113803,17.173022296789483,20.68518167103868,20.1854244572194,14.137560975609752,65.06340347156332,10.565217391304348,3.1468125371518143,0.6647875288125172,0.4624800294436916,0.0537641346563579,0.901391178369522,0.8981448270025707,5.2400513478819,4.0,3.2767337125223643,33.869565217391305,30.0,16.74957325303514,1.5866495507060334,1.0,0.9335434690660472,779,289,0.3709884467265725,4144,23,6.4.3,When all reasonable alternatives have been exhausted,Chapter 6 - Voluntarily leaving employment
406,406,"The importance of gathering the facts and the need to clarify the circumstances that led to the voluntary separation can never be overemphasized. In this regard, the Commission shall, as specified by section 51 of the EI Act:give the claimant and the employer an opportunity to provide information as to the reasons for the loss of employment; andif the information is provided, take it into account in determining the claim.It is therefore important to clarify the roles and responsibilities of each party (claimant, employer and Commission) in the unemployment insurance system.It is the responsibility of the claimant who took the initiative to voluntarily leave their employment to provide reasons for their decision and to show that the decision was justified within the meaning of the Act. The claimant is in a better position than anyone else to reconstruct the circumstances in their situation. They are the ones who experienced these events and can provide information on and explanations of what happened, the approach they took and the other reasonable alternatives they might have exercised before ultimately deciding to voluntarily leave the job.The employer's role is to provide the Commission with all required information on the circumstances surrounding the separation, particularly where the circumstances are related to the work environment.The role of the Commission officer (adjudicator) is to enable all parties to provide the information needed to make a decision, to facilitate finalization of the claim as quickly as possible and to authorize the payment of benefits within the framework established by the legislation.In seeking the facts, the adjudicator must endeavour to obtain only information that is essential in making a decision. Information gathered must be relevant to the circumstances which existed at the time the claimant left their employment. The established principles of fairness and natural justice must at all times be respected by giving both the claimant and the employer the opportunity to give their account of the facts without deeming either version to be more valid than the other before all facts are gathered. As well, in the process of seeking the facts, the final rebuttal must always go to the claimant.The adjudicator must remain neutral and objective, exercise judgment and common sense and not take an attitude that could imply that they are biased or are judging the actions or behaviour of any of the parties. The adjudicator must be able to listen and be discreet in handling the claimant's problems.In conducting the search for the facts, the adjudicator must adapt to the specific circumstances of the case. For example, where there are indications that a claimant left their employment because of sexual harassment or to protect themselves from threats or violence from a spouse or partner, the claimant should be offered the opportunity to speak to an officer of the same gender in a more private environment in order to obtain the information needed for processing the claim.In conducting fact finding on cases where sexual harassment is being alleged, the adjudicator must not expect a claimant to openly discuss the events that took place, to have kept a record of the steps taken to remedy the situation or to have taken an entirely rational approach.The adjudicator must endeavour to obtain only the basic information the claimant agrees to provide and must, of course, be discreet and considerate. In some cases, the adjudicator may consider gathering testimony from other persons who, in the claimant's opinion, are familiar with the situation. Every effort must be made to deal with the claimant in a compassionate, credible and reassuring manner.In these types of cases the adjudicator will ask the employer to provide the required information on the reason for separation. The officer will simply take the employer's version, and at no time at this stage in the gathering of facts will they reveal to the employer the account given by the claimant unless they agree to such disclosure or the employer mentions those details specifically.",42.8568304668305,14.802249522249522,15.961121682281616,18.775757575757577,17.765552825552824,13.257897897897896,61.05350805350805,9.318181818181818,2.889357004724344,0.5252614671732899,0.4873001444697704,0.0547288300615039,0.9063349366188048,0.903557288646698,5.108108108108108,4.0,2.995045011171496,30.272727272727277,23.0,13.359306657913251,1.575075075075075,1.0,0.9930284360702938,666,261,0.3918918918918919,3461,22,6.4.4,Fact-finding with all parties,Chapter 6 - Voluntarily leaving employment
407,407,"The legislation authorizes the payment of benefits within a framework established by the Act, Regulations and jurisprudence. This responsibility to determine entitlement to benefits is delegated to the adjudicator.The adjudicator's decision is not arbitrary and must at no time be based on assumptions or vague allegations. In order to be able to determine entitlement, the adjudicator must follow a rigorous procedure which involves:obtaining from the claimant, the employer or other interested parties the information needed to make a decision;considering the circumstances of the case and objectively evaluating the facts without prejudice;determining the credibility of the testimony obtained where there are contradictory statements;making a decision that is:       based on the preponderance of the evidence (whether the facts support one version of the events over another);keeping with the principles and guidelines established in accordance with the Act, Regulations and jurisprudence.In some situations, the information obtained from the various parties may, while not being totally opposite, vary only slightly. The evaluation of the credibility of the information and statements in such a case is particularly crucial. The adjudicator, therefore, will determine what is genuine, reasonable and plausible, based on the facts rather than simply on presumptions, suppositions or opinions.Particular attention should be paid to the source of the gathered information. Statements from a person who has direct knowledge of the events naturally take precedence over hearsay, especially if this is from a disinterested person.Without making it a fixed or inflexible rule, it can generally be said that a claimant's first (spontaneous) statement more accurately reflects the situation than a subsequent (modified or contradictory) statement which may serve the interest of that person in order to justify their position. It could also be said that at times the first statement may not reveal what truly happened because of a fear of not being believed, of reprisals, or simply at that time the person did not know the significance of a particular event or the consequences of their statements.Statements from the employer are no more or less valid than those from the claimant. Rather than merely accepting the employer's statements as necessarily true, they must be objectively examined. The employer may have an interest in concealing certain situations, or providing reasons that will not result in criticism, complaints or charges against the employer. It may also be the case that the employer was not aware of what actually occurred or the real reasons for the voluntary leaving.The adjudicator cannot expect that an employer will at any time openly admit, for example, that a person voluntarily left their employment because they were being harassed or being discriminated against, there existed a poisoned work environment or even that there was pressure on the person to quit.After gathering and evaluating the available information, the adjudicator will decide in favour of the facts which, taking into consideration all the circumstances, are more credible. In some cases, the accounts given by the parties will be equally credible. When the officer is faced with equally credible versions of the facts and cannot decide in favour of one version over the other, then the benefit of the doubt in such a case will be given to the claimant.The officer will accept at face value the statements of the claimant who states that he or she was a victim of sexual harassment or discrimination at the work place, and will give preference to this version of the facts even in the presence of another, also credible, version provided by the employer.The benefit of the doubt is not given merely because there are contradictory versions of the facts present. The adjudicator must first determine which version is more credible.When the claimant's version is more credible than the employer's, it does not necessarily mean that the claimant has shown that there was just cause for the voluntary leaving. This conclusion would result when, taking into account the circumstances, there was no reasonable alternative for the claimant but to leave employment.",43.864744955156965,14.0660033632287,15.414825405933506,17.786771300448432,17.33884529147982,14.137757847533631,59.26513452914799,8.75,2.9614117617155435,0.7464254365784108,0.4668090264694775,0.0588193097976374,0.8727231440336808,0.8772668892687018,5.272047832585949,4.0,3.1901584683238653,27.875,22.5,18.62416105493077,1.5919282511210762,1.0,1.0049179610567671,669,265,0.3961136023916293,3595,24,6.4.5,Benefit of the doubt,Chapter 6 - Voluntarily leaving employment
408,408,"Subsection 29(c) of the legislation identifies fourteen specific sets of circumstances that should be considered when determining if just cause exists for voluntarily leaving employment.The list established by the legislator however, is not exhaustive. It does not exclude other circumstances that should be taken into consideration even though they are not on the list. As well, those situations where a person has left employment in accordance with an employer workforce reduction process which preserves the employment of co-workers are treated in another section, since it provides for an exception to the Act. If review of the case reveals a circumstance that is not one of those listed, the person may still be able to prove that they had just cause for leaving employment, since all the circumstances leading to voluntary separation, listed or not, must be examined.It must be borne in mind that, within the terms of the legislation, just cause for voluntarily leaving employment exists where, having regard to all the circumstances, the claimant had no reasonable alternative to leaving employment.The wording of this legislative provision allows for a great deal of latitude in the analysis of the particular circumstances of each case and in making the decision as to whether or not just cause for voluntarily leaving was present. The very structure of the wording is revealing as to the intentions of the legislator who wished to ensure that the adjudicator maintained the open-mindedness required for making an informed decision that takes into account the objectives of the Act.The legislation also includes a provision which states that other reasonable circumstances may be prescribed by regulations.The sections which follow give an overview of each of the circumstances included in EIA 29(c), identify the reasonable alternatives that might be expected from a person in those circumstances and state the basic criteria used in determining whether a person had just cause within the meaning of the Act in voluntarily leaving their employment.

409,409,"Harassment is generally defined as any improper behaviour by a person that is directed at and offensive to another person and which the first person knew or ought reasonably to have known would be unwelcome. Harassment may take the form of reprehensible comments, actions or displays which humiliate degrade or embarrass another person. Harassment may come from an individual or a group of persons, managers or employees, creating a hostile and poisoned work environment that quickly becomes intolerable.Harassment also includes abuse of power through the injurious exercise of authority for the purpose of compromising a person's employment, damaging performance at work, endangering means of subsistence or interfering with that person's career in any other way. Acts such as intimidation, threats, blackmail and coercion also constitute a form of harassment.Whether sexual or non-sexual in nature or committed once or many times, harassment is reprehensible and cannot be tolerated. Sexual harassment in particular is a major problem in many workplaces and is extremely traumatic, both physically and psychologically, for the victim.Although recourse is available, victims of sexual harassment do not for the most part take any action and instead suffer in silence to avoid being judged by society or out of fear that there will be reprisals or their career will be jeopardized.Harassment is not exclusive to the workplace and can take the form of exterior threats, abuse or violence. The victim is usually a woman and the harassment originating from the spouse or other intimate partner may even go on up to the workplace.Violence against women is a serious problem that causes injury, emotional trauma and even death, and inevitably affects the victim's performance at work. Victims may feel required to leave their home and even to take leave or leave their employment to escape a violent relationship, cutting off all possible contact with their aggressor to protect their safety or their life or the lives of their loved ones.In general, claimants are fully justified in taking leave or leaving their employment in such circumstances of harassment, abuse and violence. It is their only reasonable alternative, especially since they tend to hide their circumstances from those around them and tolerate the situation, which deteriorates throughout their relationship with the originator of the harassment or violence until there are no other alternatives.A victim of harassment may react in a number of different ways that may seem illogical or unreasonable to anyone who is unfamiliar with the psychological profile of the victim and the serious trauma harassment can cause. They will generally try to avoid any contact or confrontation with the person by whom they were harassed, may request a transfer or a different work schedule, or take sick leave. Some victims even quit their jobs spontaneously to escape a situation that has become intolerable or to ensure there is no further harassment.The adjudicator cannot determine whether harassment occurred by examining the behaviour of the harassment victim after the fact. As we saw in the previous section, the adjudicator has to adapt the search for the facts to the circumstances.The fact that a person did not take any recourse or did not await the outcome of any remedy before voluntarily leaving their employment must not be considered against the claimant when the situation indicates intolerable harassment that could not have been resolved immediately or within a few days of the incident. However, if the company that employed the claimant had a credible, coherent and structured policy that the claimant could have used to resolve the situation immediately, the claimant must be asked to explain why they did not use that alternative, which on the surface appeared to be reasonable.InformationSexual or other harassmentReasonable alternatives:discuss the problem with the employer;request a transfer to another division;contact the union;use the provisions in the collective agreement;not necessary to initiate or await the outcome of legal proceedings (labour or human rights).Just cause:harassment intolerable for any period;no other reasonable alternative than to leave;existing reasonable alternatives failed to remedy the situation;valid grounds for not having used reasonable alternatives.",34.94888563049855,16.085923753665693,17.228024813938504,20.259237536656894,19.21532258064516,14.636774193548389,63.55131964809384,10.090909090909092,3.140921514296149,0.6785464080057884,0.4554237966015417,0.0638141012605598,0.8752007541202363,0.8813289016485214,5.338709677419355,4.0,3.188312156211946,31.0,25.0,12.979004023982174,1.6598240469208212,1.0,0.9904819607115816,682,303,0.4442815249266862,3699,22,6.5.2,Sexual or other harassment,Chapter 6 - Voluntarily leaving employment
410,410,"The circumstances in which a person deems it necessary to accompany a spouse or a common-law partner to another place of residence may result from the voluntary decision one or both of the spouses or common-law partners made to change residence for various reasons. It may also be dictated by events such as the illness or serious injury of a dependent child forcing a person or family to temporarily or indefinitely relocate in order to be closer to treatment centres.Subsection 2.(1) of the Act defines a common-law partner as an individual who has cohabitated in a conjugal relationship for a period of one year.Although cases and circumstances may differ, individuals who are in a common-law relationship have certain factors in common. Some basic elements include:Common residenceFinancial interdependenceSharing of responsibility in running the householdShared use of assets (car etc.)Shared responsibility in raising any childrenAbsence of these elements puts the existence of such a relationship in doubt.The fact that individuals are in a common-law relationship of less than one year and do not fall within the circumstances prescribed in Regulation 51.1 will not automatically mean that they are not eligible for benefits if they leave their employment to follow their partner. All elements that prompted these individuals to leave their employment must be evaluated. The expression in the Act having regard to all the circumstances requires that all of the evidence of the case be considered.Each situation must be examined carefully and considerations of all kinds may apply. In addition to factors already mentioned, additional evidence could include:the couple's financial situation (it may be too costly to maintain two households);the seriousness of the relationship in cases where the persons have been living together for less than twelve months;the permanency of a relationship when there is an impending marriage;evidence that the couple was in a committed relationship prior to moving;the distance between the old and new places of residence as it may be such that the couple could not have maintained a commuting relationship;the consequences on the couple's relationship of living in separate residences;efforts made to secure employment in new area of residence.Of course, this list is not exhaustive, but it does illustrate some of the issues.Where a claimant failed to prove a one year common-law relationship, the Umpire allowed her claim due to the committed nature of the relationship. Conversely, in another case where a claimant relocated to commence living with her fiancÃ© with plans to marry in more than 10 months, it was found that she had not shown just cause as the marriage was not imminent and she was not relocating to accompany her spouse as they had no history of cohabitation prior to the move.When there is no evidence that cohabitation existed, however, to accept that a decision to relocate to begin cohabitation with a person with whom a romantic relationship has begun would be to unreasonably stretch the notion of an obligation to accompany a spouse.Regulation 51.1 identifies prescribed circumstances in which a claimant can be justified to accompany to another residence a person with whom they have been cohabiting for a period of less than one year. The prescribed circumstances include a conjugal relationship where one of the two individuals has had or has adopted a child during their period of cohabitation, is expecting the birth of a child, where a child has been placed with one of them during that period for the purpose of adoption or where a claimant has an obligation to care for a member of their immediate family within the meaning of Subsection 55(2) of the Regulations.An obligation to accompany a spouse or common-law partner to another residence must not be confused with a simple desire to do so. A person who voluntarily leaves employment by personal choice to accompany their spouse or common-law partner to another residence when there are other reasonable alternatives or means available to remain in their employment would have difficulty showing just cause as required by the Act.Individuals who are married or in a common-law relationship sometimes have to move when one of them is transferred or obtains employment in another place, requiring the other person to leave their job. In these cases, it must be determined whether the person had other reasonable alternatives, such as requesting a transfer or commuting between the new place of residence and the work site that might have made it possible for them to keep their job.The length of the stay in the other place of residence is a factor to be considered in these situations when one of the spouses or common-law partner obtains temporary employment in another residential area. One alternative that seems to be reasonable is to live apart on a temporary basis, particularly if the person who relocated is able to return to the region of residence from time to time. Asking the employer for leave can also be a reasonable alternative in some instances. Such was the case where a claimant left a permanent job to accompany her spouse to a new location where the spouse had a temporary job only. It was found that the claimant did not have just cause for leaving and was held that a reasonable alternative would have been for the couple to live apart temporarily.A couple may also decide to change places of residence for personal reasons which are unrelated to the place of employment of the spouse or the common-law partner. The couple may wish, for example, to move to the country, into the city or to be close to family members. Whether this decision was made unilaterally by one person or was a joint decision made by the couple is of little importance. What has to be decided, once the decision to move was made, is whether the decision of one person to accompany the other was justified. In determining this, one must take into consideration all the circumstances surrounding this move and ask whether, in this specific case, leaving employment was the only reasonable alternative.The Act does not require that one of the spouses or common-law partners be assured of other employment before moving. However, the circumstances surrounding the move must be examined to determine whether leaving employment was the only reasonable alternative before creating the risk of being unemployed. It is important to investigate if other reasonable alternatives were available to the claimant such as requesting a transfer, commuting daily or periodically, living apart on a temporary basis or requesting a leave from the employer.The health of a spouse or child may make it necessary for an individual to stay in another place of residence to allow their sick family member to receive appropriate treatment. A reasonable alternative in this case may be to commute daily or periodically, depending on the distance and the anticipated length of the stay, or take a leave of absence for the duration of the treatment.Finally, it is important to keep an open mind when evaluating all the elements that prompted a person to leave their employment to accompany their spouse, common-law partner or child to another place of residence. The situation in which the person finds himself or herself may very well not be reflected by any of the circumstances listed in the Act. What needs to be decided is what is appropriate for that individual in their circumstances.The wording of the Act is sufficiently flexible to be able to make an informed decision as to whether leaving employment was the only reasonable alternative, having regard to all the circumstances. What is involved here is a fundamental test that the person must meet, and the Act is explicit in this regard.InformationObligation to accompany a spouse, common-law partner or dependent childReasonable alternatives:commute daily or periodically;live apart on a temporary basis if situation is not permanent;look for employment in the new region before leaving;examine the possibility of a transfer to the employer's branch at the new residence;request leave from the employer.Just cause:no possibility of an immediate transfer to the employer's branch at the new residence;situation not strictly temporary or short term;distance too great to commute daily;dependent child must live elsewhere.",41.42481648616126,15.673602372356886,16.497647041470138,19.83307546845453,18.618297404160224,12.715119133574005,60.05200275055871,8.928571428571429,3.071363192155802,0.604771939791475,0.4681943668501701,0.055372533775809,0.8768005908989325,0.8854980543255806,5.0021660649819495,4.0,3.2283707933945007,32.976190476190474,30.5,16.817632605093657,1.55956678700361,1.0,0.9444253080614714,1385,395,0.2851985559566787,7033,42,6.5.3,Obligation to accompany a spouse common-law partner or dependent child to another residence,Chapter 6 - Voluntarily leaving employment
411,411,"The list of prohibited grounds of discrimination within the meaning of the Canadian Human Rights Act includes discrimination on the grounds of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, mental or physical disability and pardoned conviction.It should also be noted that sexual harassment is a prohibited ground of discrimination within the meaning of the Canadian Human Rights Act (14(1)).The Canadian Human Rights Act confirms the right of all individuals, to the extent compatible with their rights and obligations within Canadian society, to equal opportunities to advance within the context of their work environment.Discrimination is in many ways a social problem and the intolerance that is a characteristic of discrimination is deeply rooted both in the workplace and in other sectors. Discrimination on any of the prohibited grounds listed above can never be tolerated because it deprives the victim of an inalienable right, namely the right to equal opportunities to advance in his or her work environment.Discrimination can be underhanded, lead to reprehensible behaviour or attacks from supervisors or co-workers and in some cases have lasting physical and psychological effects on the person who is discriminated against.In cases where discrimination is given as a reason for separation, the officer has to adapt the search for the facts to the circumstances and accept at face value the allegations made by the person who claims to have been discriminated against in the workplace.The fact that a person did not take any recourse or did not await the outcome of any remedy before voluntarily leaving employment must not at first glance reflect negatively on the claimant. Nor should it be considered against the claimant when the situation indicates unacceptable discrimination that could not have been resolved immediately or within a few days of the incident. However, if the company that employed the claimant had a credible, coherent and structured policy that the claimant could have used to resolve the situation immediately, the officer must ask the claimant to explain why they did not use that alternative, which on the surface appears to be reasonable.Finally, it must be understood that systemic discrimination can be directed not toward a particular person, but toward a group of persons who are systematically refused promotion to a higher position or another type of employment because of their sexual orientation or because their physical abilities are deemed inadequate. A reasonable alternative in these cases would be to consider using the human rights legislation instead of leaving the employment.InformationDiscrimination on a prohibited groundReasonable alternatives: discuss the situation with the employer;request a transfer to another division;contact the union;use the provisions in the collective agreement;consider using human rights legislation in the case of systemic discrimination.Just cause:no reasonable alternative but to leave;existing reasonable alternatives failed to remedy the situation;valid reason for not having used reasonable alternatives.",22.189326923076948,19.33708333333333,18.733933053108405,22.852564102564106,23.122975961538465,15.971083333333333,69.83974358974359,12.153846153846152,3.317758610645473,0.6708845491750799,0.4575436345998301,0.0615698618382251,0.9028485616048176,0.8932136405598033,5.539583333333334,5.0,3.553533428348309,36.92307692307692,35.0,10.9084408986911,1.7395833333333333,1.0,1.1424096578674785,480,225,0.46875,2696,13,6.5.4,Discrimination on a prohibited ground,Chapter 6 - Voluntarily leaving employment
412,412,"Every person has the right to work in conditions which protect their health, safety and physical integrity. The occasional presence of circumstances which present an immediate danger to a person's health or safety may authorize the person to leave the workplace immediately. However, it does not constitute just cause for resigning from the job as soon as the person feels the working conditions are dangerous to their health or safety.The pertinent provisions of federal and provincial legislation and numerous collective agreements stipulate that a person is entitled, for example, to refuse to carry out dangerous work or to exercise preventive withdrawal in the event of exposure to a dangerous contaminant. A worker who is pregnant or breast-feeding is also entitled to preventative withdrawal when her work is physically dangerous to herself or her child.While individuals must protect themselves from situations involving danger or risks, whether they be immediate or long term, a person in such circumstances is expected to use reasonable alternatives in order to remedy the situation. A reasonable alternative in a high-risk situation has to be accessible as quickly as possible and must be able to remedy the situation within a short time.If the danger or risks are not immediate, reasonable alternatives could be to discuss the concerns with the employer, request an investigation, or file a complaint with the union or agencies responsible for enforcing the pertinent occupation safety and health legislation. Case law places a strong emphasis on the idea that an employee can only be seen as exhausting reasonable alternatives if a complaint is launched with the provincial health and safety regulator. There must be very good reasons for failing to do so. If the situation still does not improve and the working conditions affect their health, a person could reasonably provide proof of this by means of a medical certificate or other similar document.Some occupations or work sites present higher health or safety risks than others. In many cases these risks are reduced by preventive measures or appropriate equipment.Generally, a claimant does not have just cause for leaving employment because of the working conditions commonly present for that occupation unless they can demonstrate that, for example, the equipment provided is inadequate for safety purposes. Before leaving the employment in question, a reasonable alternative would be to report the situation to the employer, the union or an authorized agency so that the situation can be remedied within a reasonable period of time.Should a claimant voluntarily leave their employment on doctor's advice due to their health being adversely affected, medical documentation on file attesting that it was not reasonable to continue in that state will constitute just cause.InformationWorking conditions that constitute a danger to health or safetyReasonable alternatives:discuss the situation with the employer;request a transfer to another division;contact the union;use the provisions in the collective agreement;file a complaint under occupational safety and health legislation.Just cause:real danger not normally inherent in the occupation;no other reasonable alternative;recourse exhausted;medical or other certificate confirming that a doctor advised the claimant to quit because the working conditions are a health hazard.",37.21034482758623,15.273639846743295,16.92669308720184,19.645977011494253,18.76747126436782,15.26022988505747,62.524904214559385,9.72222222222222,2.919795251283899,0.5182062324801537,0.4715948689030903,0.0460292027872881,0.8764157821150387,0.8778694495558739,5.455938697318008,5.0,3.295034750029932,29.0,32.0,9.498537899183338,1.657088122605364,1.0,0.99193952002705,522,230,0.4406130268199233,2890,18,6.5.5,Working conditions that constitute a danger to health or safety,Chapter 6 - Voluntarily leaving employment
413,413,"Caring for a child is synonymous with attending to or taking responsibility for the child. In fact, when one thinks about it, this necessity is present every day of a child's life, even if the responsibilities are shared with the spouse or delegated to a family member, a caregiver or day-care services, or educational institutions.The added necessity of caring for a child is obvious when the child is very young, has a disability or is going through a difficult period.A person's responsibilities in this regard may in some circumstances be difficult to co-ordinate with the requirements of the job held when, for example, their child is sick, they no longer have a caregiver or other problems exist which require the presence of a parent or at the very least another trusted person.The necessity is also present when a close family member requires constant care or the continuous presence of a family member they can trust. Immediate family is defined in subsection 55(2) of the Regulations.The necessity dictated by certain life situations is beyond a person's control when, for example, a child or close family member is gravely ill, has had an accident or is living in distress.Depending on the circumstances, a reasonable alternative could be to seek temporary help from friends, request leave, consider engaging the regular services of another person or rearranging the work schedule.In order to show just cause, the claimant would have to show that voluntarily leaving employment was undertaken only when all reasonable alternatives had been exhausted. Once the claimant has proven they had no reasonable alternative but to leave their employment to care for the close family member it will be difficult for them to prove they are available and capable of working and therefore entitled to collect regular benefits.The necessity of taking care of a young child must not be confused with the simple desire to do so, as the latter is a voluntary personal choice by the insured person. A person who voluntarily leaves employment by personal choice to take care of his or her child and then applies for regular benefits would have difficulty showing just cause as required by the Act.InformationObligation to care for a child or a member of the immediate familyReasonable alternatives:seek help from relatives, friends or neighbours;try to engage the services of another person on a regular basis;try to change the work schedule;consider sharing responsibilities with other family members;request leave from the employer.Just cause:presence required rather than a deliberate personal choice;no reasonable alternative but to leave;recourse exhausted.",42.34833333333336,15.018359788359792,15.81161729744533,18.73174603174603,17.908363095238094,13.08990740740741,58.86640211640212,8.642857142857142,3.156165001088155,0.7097333652974115,0.4651894429450978,0.0530541120222685,0.8881004865352924,0.8739203860362371,5.076388888888889,4.0,3.2010122699654144,30.857142857142858,31.0,12.21741814470017,1.5740740740740742,1.0,0.9666063554337324,432,194,0.449074074074074,2236,14,6.5.6,Obligation to care for a child or a member of the immediate family,Chapter 6 - Voluntarily leaving employment
414,414,"In addition to discussing the issue of leaving one employment for another, the sections which follow will also address situations such as leaving employment held concurrently with another and leaving permanent employment for temporary/seasonal employment.The situation described in paragraph 29(c)(vi) of the Employment Insurance Act assumes three things: reasonable assurance, another employment, and the immediate future. A conditional offer of employment does not constitute reasonable assurance of another employment.A person may decide to leave their current employment for other employment which they consider more suitable only to find themselves out of work because the promised employment has been delayed or even cancelled. The claimant would have just cause for leaving their employment under these circumstances only if they were reasonably assured of the other employment in the immediate future.The new employment must be scheduled to begin in the immediate future, that is, in the days immediately following the voluntary leaving so that there is no break or only a short break between the two jobs. A longer break might be reasonable where the promised employment requires the person to move or make other arrangements. Searching for or obtaining other employment shortly after leaving employment does not in itself constitute proof that the person had reasonable assurance of employment at the time of leaving.The new employment does not have to be an absolute certainty. It is important, however, that the person have a genuine promise or reasonable assurance from an employer that he or she will be hired. Simply being made aware of opportunities and being hopeful of finding other employment is not sufficient.The court has confirmed and emphasized the long established principle that simply being aware of an opening does not constitute reasonable assurance of another employment in the immediate future. When fact-finding on such cases is conducted, elements which must be examined in determining whether or not the claimant's situation corresponds to that set forth in paragraph 29(c)(vi) include:for there to be assurance, there must be a certainty, some type of guarantee. As the Act indicates reasonable assurance, absolute certainty is not required;for there to be other employment, the claimant must have been in contact with the possible employer, there must have been some offer of employment and there must be some idea of hiring conditions and time frames;if the possibility of employment is conditional upon completion of a course, there is no reasonable assurance of another employment;for the employment to be in the immediate future, it must occur in the near future. Although time limitations are not defined by the legislation, the Court has ruled in cases where the delay was eight and thirteen weeks, that this was not employment in the immediate future.The fact that the promised employment did not come about or ultimately proved to be short term should not count against the person if he or she acted in good faith. A reasonable alternative in such circumstances could be for the person to try to withdraw the resignation and return to the old job as soon as they learn the new employment, for reasons beyond their control, has fallen through or would be for a shorter period.",41.4599900299103,15.236209150326795,17.05364977622574,20.102403899412877,18.61578265204387,13.748625235404898,62.49706436246815,9.764705882352942,3.023504745598938,0.689018868035137,0.4526066045686318,0.0589859337189098,0.8825087733566761,0.8627471208572388,5.186440677966102,4.0,2.91064103088982,31.235294117647054,29.0,15.73878465957755,1.5800376647834276,1.0,0.8693877310095602,531,219,0.4124293785310734,2798,17,6.5.7,Reasonable assurance of another employment in the immediate future,Chapter 6 - Voluntarily leaving employment
415,415,"Claimants often occupy more than one job at the same time giving rise to situations where the claimant leaves one job voluntarily while maintaining the other. The issue of voluntary leaving is applicable to the employment left voluntarily. When a claimant is working part-time or full-time for one employer and full-time for another employer concurrently, and leaves one employment with the expectation that their full-time employment will continue, then the voluntary separation from the employment they left is with just cause. Full-time employment means that the claimant works the number of hours normally worked by full-time employees in the same occupation or industry. In most cases, full-time employment is considered to be 35 hours or more per week.These cases arise when the full-time employment ends unexpectedly after the decision was made to leave the other part-time or full-time  employment, giving rise to a claim for benefits. Claimants who accept part-time or full-time work in addition to already held full-time work should not be penalized for leaving the employment they accepted,  as long as they do so with the knowledge that their full-time employment will continue. The reason for separation from the employment is not determinative of the issue. It is sufficient that there is an expectation that the full-time employment will continue. In such cases fact-finding will be conducted with the claimant and/or employer to confirm that the claimant was not aware or expecting their full-time employment to end when they voluntarily left their other employment.There may also be situations encountered where a claimant requests benefits after voluntarily leaving one of two part-time jobs which had been held concurrently. In such cases, thorough fact finding must be done to determine whether the claimant's actions were the only reasonable alternative given all the circumstances. In such scenarios, it must be determined whether the claimant left one position for the other as there was more earning potential, increased hours of work, better chances of advancement or permanent employment. Additionally, the fact finding may reveal that there was a conflict between the two jobs such as the hours, duties or violation of interest between the two employers. As with all cases of voluntary leaving, the adjudicator must consider whether the claimant's reasons amounted to just cause in making such a decision versus whether the claimant made a personal choice of one part-time position over the other thus creating an unemployment situation.",52.15065874901032,12.957900237529696,15.202697889610205,17.592462391132226,16.28758511480602,12.71296912114014,55.62011084718922,7.733333333333333,2.9807241304153798,0.7364891289741772,0.4587360498196792,0.0678107253128368,0.8896520520959582,0.8831139711233286,5.028503562945368,4.0,2.736946109755729,28.066666666666663,26.0,11.132335284606231,1.491686460807601,1.0,0.876210940303162,421,166,0.3942992874109263,2165,15,6.5.7.1,Leaving an employment held concurrently with another employment,Chapter 6 - Voluntarily leaving employment
416,416,"A person does not generally have just cause in leaving one employment for another when the end result is unemployment. This occurs, for example, when a person quits a full-time time or permanent job for temporary or part-time employment knowing well in advance that the new employment will only be of short duration. If the claimant entered into this new employment knowing that it would be temporary, in order to avoid disqualification they must prove that in their situation they had no other reasonable alternative.Once more, the importance of fact finding is raised. This process should clarify the circumstances that led a person to leave their permanent employment for a temporary or part-time employment. Reasons may include:The new employment was seen by the claimant as a way to get out of an employment that was poorly paid or had poor working conditions with no opportunity for promotion or a better position;The new employment was more advantageous in terms of wages or working conditions when compared with the permanent or full-time employment;The new employment was with a well-established and recognized employer within a field of activities that presented career opportunities, good possibilities to apply for another position once there or be extended or rehired shortly.A case of a great interest involved a claimant who quit indeterminate permanent employment in August for seasonal permanent employment at much higher wages expecting to last until December. The claimant applied for benefit when laid off in October. The Court said that in such a case the timing of the voluntary leaving and the expected duration of the seasonal employment are the most important circumstances to consider in determining whether the leaving was a reasonable alternative. Leaving to take seasonal employment when the work season is ending and with no expectation that the requalification conditions of Section 30 of the EI Act could be met creates an unjustified certainty of unemployment.Claimants in this situation may be justified in leaving their permanent employment if at the time of leaving there was a definite employment offer and the expected duration of the temporary employment when accepted was expected to be of a lengthy duration.The recommended fact finding on this issue is to obtain from the claimant (and employer) what the expected duration of the new employment was to have been if it was not an offer of permanent employment.In looking at the anticipated duration of the employment, whether the new employment's duration alone was sufficient to support the establishment of a claim could be one factor considered.Facts on file would have to show that at the time the claimant accepted the offer of new employment they had no advance knowledge that it would be for a short duration. When they accepted the offer of new employment, they had reasonable assurance, for example, that the new employment presented career opportunities, the possibility of a permanent position in the future, etc. The fact that the promised employment that was initially expected to be for a long duration proved to be short term due to unforeseen circumstances will not count against the person if he or she acted in good faith.If the claimant accepts new employment fully aware that it would be of a short duration, then in order to avoid disqualification, they would have to prove that leaving the permanent job was the only reasonable alternative. Claimants should not deliberately place themselves in a position of possible unemployment. The adjudicator should ask if there were other underlying reasons the claimant wished to leave the first employment and if the opportunity to move to the temporary work provided an opportunity to escape an otherwise intolerable situation.As mentioned previously, the legislation does not ask claimants to do the impossible in establishing just cause for voluntarily leaving. All it requires is what is reasonable under the circumstances. The particular set of circumstances in each situation must be examined in order to determine if the person made a reasonable choice to leave a permanent or full-time employment and give preference to a temporary employment.InformationReasonable assurance of another employment in the immediate futureReasonable alternatives:try to withdraw the resignation or get the old job back.Just cause:genuine promise of other employment in the immediate future;not obtained for reasons beyond the person's control;new employment would not have created an unemployment situation (full-time vs. part-time or on-call, permanent vs. temporary);searching for or obtaining new employment after leaving is not sufficient.",36.68578934262948,15.936821049136784,17.879347455551382,21.04933598937583,18.64566733067729,13.70294820717131,63.11470783532536,9.958333333333334,3.18723260996539,0.7189196760711878,0.4435983829065704,0.0601955300796361,0.8798432298328566,0.8771565854549408,5.177954847277556,4.0,3.236608748241945,31.375,32.0,16.652858863670627,1.6347941567065074,1.0,1.0102846909815697,753,268,0.3559096945551129,3957,24,6.5.7.2,Leaving permanent employment for temporary/seasonal employment,Chapter 6 - Voluntarily leaving employment

A person is also entitled to expect to be paid without undue delay for work completed. Things do not always turn out that way, however.Some examples of this would be:there is a significant and unilateral modification in the terms and conditions respecting the person's wages or salary;there is a change in the terms and conditions of employment that has a significant impact on wages and salary;a formal promise of a pay increase is not honoured;the salary terms negotiated at the time of hiring are not respected;the person's total take-home pay is changed without justification; orthe person cannot be paid because of financial difficulties on the part of the employer.The employer breaches the employment contract if there is a failure to honour a prior promise to grant a pay increase. Even if they have no other employment prospects, a person has just cause for leaving provided they first use the available reasonable alternatives for remedying the situation, whether through the union or by using the provisions in the collective agreement.This applies only if there is a formal promise which can be verbal or written. Vague promises or assurances that are constantly put off are not sufficient. The officer will have to determine which version is the most credible when the information gathered from each of the parties is contradictory and raises doubt as to the existence of a genuine promise.Dissatisfaction with the rate of pay, the desire for a promotion and the denial of a pay increase do not in themselves constitute just cause for leaving employment. A reasonable alternative in these circumstances would be to bring the situation to the employer's attention and, in the event there is no satisfactory resolution, not leaving until other employment more in line with the person's expectations is obtained.A person who is new in a job and finds that the employer is not honouring the salary terms agreed to at the time of hiring has just cause in leaving employment provided they used the available reasonable alternatives.Unless it is justified or inherent in the occupation, a decrease in a person's total take-home pay can constitute just cause for voluntarily leaving employment except where the decrease is minimal.A decrease in pay may be considered justified where, for example, a person fails to meet the conditions established to receive a particular salary.A person does not have just cause for voluntarily leaving employment if they object to a substantial decrease in pay accepted by the union or a majority of the employees in order to help keep the employer in business.A decrease in pay during the winter caused by less favourable conditions inherent in the work sector does not constitute just cause. Nor is there just cause when the decrease in pay is caused by a change in the place of work, that is, from one site to another, or when the decrease is the result of the fact that the employer replaced daily pay with a piecework rate.A change in employment status from full-time to part-time with a significant reduction in the number of hours to be worked on a weekly basis impacts on the amount the claimant will earn and could certainly constitute a significant modification of terms and conditions respecting wages and salary. It is similar when there is a unilateral modification of a person's employment with a significant reduction in the hours worked and the introduction of a split shift that renders the employment no longer suitable. Just cause may then exist.An employer may be experiencing financial difficulties that may prevent the payment of wages due. Even though a person is entitled to be paid for work completed without undue delay, leaving employment on the strength of mere suspicion as to the solvency of the employer is not just cause.If a pay cheque is not honoured at the bank the claimant must first ascertain through the employer or the union that the problem was not simply an error or the result of another factor not related to financial difficulties.InformationSignificant modification in terms and conditions respecting wages or salaryReasonable alternatives:try to reach an agreement with the employer;contact the union ;use the provisions in the collective agreement.Just cause:genuine promise of pay increase or advancement made at the time of hiring or afterward;definite, not vague agreement as to wages;reason given by the employer does not justify the decrease in pay;decrease in pay not minimal;no recourse or available remedies exhausted.",46.902671264367854,14.498107790549174,15.540361756968949,18.55609706257982,17.4672030651341,12.264418901660278,58.52306513409962,8.52,2.932692646404121,0.6149245285134073,0.478641212930004,0.0704496061315835,0.8633247340718905,0.8516512487245642,4.933588761174968,4.0,3.088425765795828,31.32,32.0,16.627014163703596,1.5146871008939975,1.0,0.8909801298285623,783,267,0.3409961685823754,3925,25,6.5.8,Significant modification of terms and conditions respecting wages and salary,Chapter 6 - Voluntarily leaving employment
418,418,"Overtime is not an uncommon occurrence in the workplace. It is however unreasonable for an employer to require a person to work an excessive amount of overtime or to not pay a person an appropriate amount for overtime work. Such actions often violate the provisions in collective agreements or labour standards legislation.Simply objecting to working outside the normal schedule does not constitute just cause for voluntarily leaving employment. If a claimant is being dismissed for refusing to work overtime, the guiding question is whether the person lost their employment by reason of misconduct and should be adjudicated according to the principles in Chapter 7.A claimant does not have just cause for leaving employment if they frequently have to work overtime and receive leave credits in lieu of pay. In such a case it cannot be said that they have not been compensated for the hours worked.Whether or not there is extra pay, being required to work an excessive amount of overtime may constitute just cause for a person voluntarily leaving employment unless the overtime is required in an emergency or on a short-term basis.Depending on the occupation and the level of responsibility, however, a person may not receive any additional compensation for overtime hours worked. There will be situations where individuals will devote extra hours to a job on their own initiative. This is considered to be a personal choice and if such overtime is not required or approved by the employer, no compensation would be expected for these hours.Payment for overtime hours, at either the normal rate or a higher rate, is often provided for in the employment contract or prescribed by law. Failure by an employer to fulfill the obligations constitutes just cause for voluntarily leaving employment only where a person first attempted all reasonable alternatives for remedying the situation.InformationExcessive overtime work or refusal to pay for overtime workReasonable Alternatives:discuss the situation with the employer;contact the union;use the provisions in the collective agreement;consider the possibility of filing a complaint under labour standards legislation.Just cause:excessive number of hours other than in an emergency or on a short-term basis;overtime demanded by employer on a continual basis;the hours were not inherent in that type of occupation;no cash payment or other compensation for hours worked;no recourse or available remedies exhausted.",43.49981319622967,13.634539845758358,14.836745963215662,16.8514824335904,16.442759211653815,14.151568123393314,59.35235646958013,8.666666666666666,2.7538043137990167,0.5027931932900472,0.4678929497928213,0.0784432404146515,0.8397145356450763,0.8406988244790298,5.287917737789203,4.0,3.2653643995139947,25.933333333333334,25.0,13.46336593212196,1.6195372750642674,1.0,0.9454144732579098,389,168,0.4318766066838046,2082,15,6.5.9,Excessive overtime work or refusal to pay for overtime work,Chapter 6 - Voluntarily leaving employment
419,419,"An employee is entitled to expect the employer to respect the terms of the employment contract or collective agreement and to not unilaterally make significant changes in their initial tasks and duties without consulting the person or providing appropriate compensation.A number of factors come into play in these circumstances, in particular the scope of the changes, the anticipated duration of the changes, whether the changes are imposed unilaterally by the employer or were agreed to by the union or the employee, and whether the changes had any effect on the person's pay. In other words, it must be determined whether the changes in the tasks and duties were unreasonable, led to abuse or unduly breached the terms and conditions negotiated at the time of hiring, or contained in the employment contract or collective agreement.A claimant has just cause for leaving employment when the employer unilaterally makes significant changes in the duties set out in the employment contract or collective agreement that result in a substantial change in the nature of the work and the duties to be performed. This is especially true if the changes lead to a decrease in the pay the person would have received in the future. A reasonable alternative to leaving would be to take recourse, if any, through the union and to use the provisions in the collective agreement. Claimants are also expected to consult with their provincial employment standards boards regarding their rights.Changes in or additions of duties or responsibilities that are not excessive or were agreed to by the employer and the union or the employee do not constitute just cause if the person finds the new duties difficult or unpleasant or simply dislikes the new duties.Unless the situation is improper or unreasonable, changes in the tasks and duties of an unspecialized person whose job is not covered by a collective agreement or employment contract stipulating explicit tasks do not constitute just cause for voluntarily leaving employment.It is uncertain in some instances whether a person in fact leaves voluntarily or whether it is actually a constructive dismissal when there are many indications that all the employer was trying to do was get rid of a particular person for one reason or another. An employer can unilaterally and significantly increase the duties and responsibilities of a person without providing compensation, impose certain unreasonable requirements or performance standards or greatly reduce the person's decision-making authority, duties and responsibilities or even his or her pay, or assign the person to useless and demeaning tasks in order to humiliate the person.The day will eventually come when the person will have had enough and will leave the job. This may be considered a case of constructive dismissal without misconduct and the person may be considered to have just cause for voluntarily leaving.InformationSignificant changes in work dutiesReasonable alternatives:discuss the situation with the employer;contact the union;use the provisions in the collective agreement.Just cause:situation genuinely intolerable, not just difficult or unpleasant;does not include cases where a person is simply dissatisfied;the fact that many people left can be an indicator;unreasonable addition of tasks or responsibilities;downgrading not justified;indications of constructive dismissal;no reasonable alternative but to leave;existing reasonable alternatives failed to remedy the situation.",29.331584719654984,18.12812569316081,17.879347455551382,21.820382008626,22.09479359211337,15.2030314232902,68.04448552064079,11.533333333333331,3.1848240194848745,0.5683316989969771,0.4496163839316539,0.0453945288953103,0.8880480825901031,0.8930270350896395,5.412199630314233,4.0,3.6229601265328855,36.06666666666667,41.0,13.625792535563654,1.66543438077634,1.0,1.0998602019387371,541,211,0.3900184842883549,2964,15,6.5.10,Significant changes in work duties,Chapter 6 - Voluntarily leaving employment
420,420,"In every workplace there is conflict between employees and their supervisors: the employee does not perform his or her duties to the supervisor's liking, the person is frequently late, the supervisor is too demanding, the employee and supervisor see things differently or there is a personality conflict.In some isolated instances, the situation may well be serious enough to constitute just cause for voluntarily leaving, as might be the case if an employer made unfair comments about an employee to co-workers or cast doubt on his or her honesty.Occasional friction, animosity or conflict is certainly not going to improve the work atmosphere, but these situations do not in themselves constitute just cause for leaving employment. If each person makes a reasonable effort to accommodate differences and find a common ground, the situation should not degenerate into constant or irresolvable conflict.A reasonable alternative before quitting could include reporting the situation to a higher level, request a transfer, contact the union, and look for other work before quitting. If there are no reasonable alternatives or the reasonable alternative fails, a person certainly has just cause for leaving the employment. No one should have to indefinitely endure an intolerable work atmosphere or regular conflict created by superiors.A claimant would not have just cause, however, if they were largely responsible for the conflict and had ultimately aggravated the situation.

Another example would be a person being asked to deliver contraband goods or hazardous materials without the proper authorization.A claimant would have just cause for leaving employment in cases where such practices or activities were proven or where the person honestly believed that the employer's activities were illegal.

422,422,"A person has the right to become a member or refuse to join a particular association or union of workers. This right should not be infringed by the employer or the union.Once a person has joined such an association or union, they have the right to observe the lawful rules of the association or union. This right does not provide any protection against restrictions often imposed by unions on their own members; rather, it protects one's lawful union activities against restrictions imposed by the employer or any union of which the individual is not a member.A person does not have just cause for leaving employment simply because their union orders them to leave or face a fine or expulsion.The situation is different if, because of their membership or involvement in lawful activities of such an association or union, a person is discriminated against or is treated improperly by the employer. The person must, however, first use the reasonable alternatives available to them in order to prove they had no reasonable alternative but to voluntarily leave their position.Although, upon first glance, Section 35 of the legislation appears to apply to cases where claimants leave their employment due to union pressure, this is not the case.Section 35 EIA states:35. Notwithstanding anything in this Part, no claimant is disqualified or disentitled under sections 30 to 33 from receiving benefits only because the claimant left or refused to accept employment if, by remaining in or accepting the employment, the claimant would lose the rightto become or refrain from becoming a member of an association, organization or union of workers; orto continue to be a member and to observe the lawful rules of an association, organization or union of workers.EIA 35 is intended to protect the right of a claimant to become (or not become) a member of an association, organization or union (a), and the right to continue to be a member and observe the lawful rules (b). In other words, claimants are not disqualified for quitting when remaing in the job or accepting a job forces them to join a union, quit a union or refuse membership in a union. It is important to note that this protects the employee from unreasonable pressures by the employer; it does not address the relationship between the employee and the union.The loss of the right referred to in EIA 35 is intended to apply to the loss of a legal right related to membership in a union and observance of lawful rules. It is not intended to apply to the application of internal union policies, by-laws, constitutions etc. that may result in a claimant being threatened or in fact fined or expelled from his or her particular union.The Courts have consistently held that threats or pressure exerted by a union on a claimant to leave employment is a personal matter between the claimant and the union, and should not be considered just cause for quitting employment.Cases have been ruled upon where claimants (union members working in non-unionized employment) received threats from their union. The threats were to leave the non-unionized employment or else withdraw their membership in the union or face being charged under the union's constitution thereby losing their right to continue as a union member. The union also threatened that they would be expelled and never allowed to become a member again or work on a site where members are employed. In such cases where the claimant left the non-unionized employment because he felt he had no choice, this was seen as being a personal decision.InformationDiscrimination with regard to employment because of membership in a unionReasonable alternatives:contact the union;use the provisions in the collective agreement;consider taking recourse under labour rights legislation.Just cause:indications that the employer is using tactics that violate the free exercise of lawful union activities;does not include pressure, such as the threat of fines or expulsion, applied by his or her own union rather than the employer;no recourse or available remedies exhausted.",43.88960353162349,14.782412380824493,15.124630588136114,18.04025782194172,17.158505438431582,12.203840472673557,58.09916744997986,8.409090909090908,3.167087778464823,0.8059930585213182,0.4531131545318753,0.0549232361480171,0.834628667150225,0.8358043193817138,4.926144756277695,4.0,3.0506088788113828,30.772727272727277,28.0,13.915105651386776,1.5568685376661744,1.0,0.910354485876501,677,238,0.3515509601181684,3403,22,6.5.13,Discrimination with regard to employment because of membership in a union,Chapter 6 - Voluntarily leaving employment
423,423,"There are many reasons why an employer would want a person to leave: the person's performance is no longer satisfactory, the person's salary is too high because of seniority, or the employer wishes to eliminate certain positions. An employer may be prevented from ending the employment because it would be necessary to justify the decision, the employer does not want to confront the union or face action on the grounds of unlawful dismissal or simply because of image. The temptation therefore is strong to pressure the person to leave on their own. This pressure and the tactics used can become unacceptable over time.Mere innuendo or insinuations by the employer regarding the advantages of early retirement or to the effect that the job is going to become more demanding, that a person has lost some of his or her skills or that it would be better for the person to leave on good terms with excellent service records and a letter of recommendation, do not constitute just cause for voluntarily leaving employment. Neither is having the impression that one is no longer wanted or the feeling of not being able to keep up with changes.The situation is different if the innuendo is more pressing and regular or if the employer either subtly or overtly uses tactics that make the situation intolerable and the work atmosphere unbearable. There could, for example, be intimidation, thinly veiled threats of losing the right to early retirement allowances or efforts to downgrade a person by assigning him or her only useless or demeaning work.Provided he or she used the available reasonable alternatives, either through the union or using the collective agreement, a person has just cause for leaving his or her employment if these alternatives failed to remedy the situation.InformationUndue pressure by an employer on employees to leave their employmentReasonable alternatives:contact the union;use the provisions in the collective agreement;look for another job.Just cause:situation was truly intolerable for some time;does not include early leaving without searching for other employment;does not include innuendo based more on pretext than on genuine grounds;does not include leaving simply to receive certain monetary benefits.",40.32858951633327,15.742081539630284,16.35954948731386,19.628361610534316,19.212248670549503,13.659387186629528,63.83413522410737,10.181818181818182,3.0670586766781267,0.7317750584875276,0.497018236764537,0.0476622810876039,0.9048506498336792,0.8966094983948601,5.164345403899722,4.0,3.042550435225541,32.63636363636363,33.0,14.90132835611844,1.5766016713091922,1.0,0.9044049645714558,359,182,0.5069637883008357,1882,11,6.5.14,Undue pressure by an employer on employees to leave their employment,Chapter 6 - Voluntarily leaving employment

425,425,"Claimants who are not working because they requested and were granted a leave of absence are considered unemployed, although on a temporary basis. Because the employee's actions triggered this period of unemployment, the reasons for requesting the leave of absence are subject to the same considerations as voluntarily severing the employment entirely. Because the leave of absence is a temporary situation, though, a finding of no just cause results in a disentitlement rather than a disqualification. The disentitlement applies to each day of the leave.The leave may be for a few days or interspersed with employment. The claimant will be disentitled for any days that constitute a leave of absence.The leave that the person took voluntarily with the employer's permission may be with or without pay. The terms of the leave must require that the person return to work on a date agreed to by the claimant and the employer, although the agreement need not be made before the leave begins.Just because the employer authorizes the leave, it does not mean that the claimant had just cause within the meaning of the EI Act. It is up to the Commission to determine, based on the information gathered, whether the leave was the only reasonable alternative having regard to all the circumstances. The current adjudication principles concerning a finding of just cause continue to apply to these cases.If imposed by the employer or set out in the employee's contract that the claimant must take leave (without pay or with reduced pay), then this is considered to be a lay-off. Even if the claimant was able to choose the period in which such imposed leave could be taken, this would not change the fact that the leave was not taken voluntarily. In such circumstances, a disentitlement will not be imposed.If the person asks the employer to reduce the employment from full-time to part-time and the employer agrees, then the employer has agreed to the claimant taking leave and thus the days of employment lost are considered as leaves of absence. In such situations however, officers must also consider other issues such as interruption of earnings and availability.When it is shown that a person has voluntarily taken a period of leave without just cause, a disentitlement will be imposed and the person will not be entitled to receive benefits until they meet one of three relief measures outlined in Section 32(2) of the EI Act.a) Resumes the employmentWhether or not the person returns to work is not an issue with respect to the termination of the disentitlement. It will suffice that the period of leave is over. However, if the claimant did not recommence employment, the adjudicator must consider the issue of voluntary leaving and just cause pursuant to Section 29 and 30 of the Act.b) Loses or voluntarily leaves the employmentUnlike indefinite disqualifications, to lose employment in these situations does not necessarily mean that the person was dismissed. The condition to terminate the disentitlement will be met if the person is fired or quits the employment. Of course, should the person quit without just cause or be fired for misconduct, these issues must be addressed.Moreover, in situations of lay-offs where there is a complete and final severance of the employer/employee relationship that leaves a claimant with no possibility to resume work, a period of leave ends on the same day the employment ends. In such cases, the anticipated period of leave becomes no longer effective and consequently the disentitlement should be terminated on the last day of the final period of leave.c) After the beginning of the period of leave, accumulates with another employer the number of hours of insurable employment required by Section 7 or 7.1 to qualify to receive benefitsUnlike indefinite disqualifications, the claimant is only required to meet the requalifying conditions; a new claim need not be established. If the claim is a renewal, the disentitlement is terminated at the point the VER is met. If it is an initial claim, and the VER has been met, the disentitlement is not imposed.If the conditions for ending the disentitlement have not been met when the claim ends the disentitlement will be carried over to the next benefit period.If the claimant decides to voluntarily quit the employment while on leave of absence, the disentitlement will be terminated on the date prior to the date the claimant decided to voluntarily leave. The officer must then adjudicate the reason for voluntarily leaving and impose an indefinite disqualification if applicable.Adjudicators will impose the disentitlement for each day of leave. However, if the end date of the continuous period of leave is for a future date, the officer will impose an indefinite disentitlement for control purposes, as the claimant must meet specific conditions before the disentitlement can be terminated.Report navigationPrevious part of reportTable of contentsNext part of report",50.25113886113888,12.41583083583084,13.977394000776007,15.73923853923854,14.437076257076257,12.292454212454214,51.55810855810856,6.636363636363637,2.8323075496287577,0.6977112786225561,0.4622112827009145,0.0777257572480633,0.8656500708311796,0.8597182400764958,4.9804639804639805,4.0,3.175702824480083,24.818181818181817,23.0,13.905426334445837,1.5531135531135531,1.0,1.0309256840841972,819,280,0.3418803418803419,4158,33,6.6.2,Authorized period of leave - section 32,Chapter 6 - Voluntarily leaving employment

427,427,"Using the term workforce reduction in employment insurance regulations may give rise to some confusion. This term has long been used for personnel management and in collective agreements. It generally deals with a myriad of mechanisms that an employer can use to reduce staff, permanently or temporarily. The term should therefore not be viewed in its usual application but rather applied to a process of limited duration and purpose and within the specific context of Regulation 51. That regulation provides for an exception to the Act which disqualifies claimants who voluntarily leave their employment without just cause.Businesses must constantly adapt to market forces. Employers, both large and small, have always had procedures for hiring and releasing personnel. In a restructuring context, employers and workers reach agreements as to who will stay, who will go and what special provisions will be provided to those who leave. Those who leave allow other workers to stay on and the business to be competitive.A person who voluntarily leaves their employment without just cause is indefinitely disqualified from receiving benefit. However, a regulatory provision allows workers who agree to leave their employment under a work force reduction process and preserve jobs of their co-workers, to receive unemployment insurance benefits. Of course, they must also meet the other entitlement conditions which are discussed in other chapters of the Digest.The legislation requires a strictly individual approach to claimants leaving their employment. However, in the context of employer downsizing, a collective approach is acceptable in the sense that all of the workers are affected by the workforce adjustment. As such, the overall number of employees let go will not change, but those who do leave will not necessarily be those who would have been targeted for lay-off under the collective agreement, contract or some other agreement. The end result is that the Commission ends up with the same number of claimants. Whether it is a small, medium-sized or large firm, this Regulation provides firms with the flexibility needed to restructure and reduce their workforce by providing relief from disqualification for those workers who protect the employment of a co-worker under a workforce reduction process.An employer may resort to attrition to reduce the payroll. Attrition will reduce the workforce by not hiring workers when someone leaves for whatever reason. This will result in a reduction of the total workforce but will not meet the requirements of Regulation 51 as lay-off of employees is not an option when we are dealing with downsizing by means of attrition. Employees who quit their employment when employers reduce their workforce through attrition do not receive the befit of the workforce reduction relief from disqualification.Besides attrition, an employer may take other measures, such as reducing the work week and sharing the work among all employees or proceeding unilaterally with a lay-off. Neither of these processes would meet the regulatory requirements of Regulation 51.The fact that an employer has a workforce reduction process does not necessarily mean that all employees who leave their employment during this period do so in the context of this provision. Employees who are not covered by the workforce reduction process and nevertheless decide to leave employment cannot invoke the workforce reduction process to obtain relief from a disqualification under the Act. They have not left their employment within the framework of a workforce reduction process.",47.14178412698416,12.318339329805998,14.668281842747778,16.267767195767195,14.780793650793647,13.943774250440914,54.778765432098766,7.28,2.682454372754337,0.5153465148096668,0.4545741789410834,0.0633370188135961,0.8484948699673017,0.8590272483618363,5.28042328042328,4.0,2.9732531066159225,22.68,19.0,10.498457029487714,1.6155202821869488,1.0,0.9354694202296262,567,230,0.4056437389770723,3042,25,6.7.2,Within a particular context,Chapter 6 - Voluntarily leaving employment
428,428,"The regulation does not impose any restrictions on an employer who wishes to establish a workforce reduction process. However, employees who voluntarily leave their employment under a workforce reduction process that meets the regulatory text may come within the exception and not be disqualified from benefits.This regulation is analysed in two stages.Stage one:This initial stage applies to all workers. It involves determining whether a given employer has a workforce reduction process within the meaning of the Regulation.Fact finding may be conducted first on the issue of compliance with the regulation. The results may be distributed to interested parties or to other Commission offices.A workforce reduction process, as defined in the regulatory text, must have the following four elements:The workforce reduction process is initiated by the employer;The objective of the workforce reduction process is a permanent reduction in the overall number of employees in the business;The workforce reduction process offers employees the option to voluntarily leave employment;The elements of the workforce reduction process are to be documented by the employer.(a) The workforce reduction process is initiated by the employer;It is the employer who must institute a process designed to reduce the workforce. Whether it is a process affecting only a small sector of the business or involves a larger, national process is of no importance. The number of employees affected, the locations, operations and activities covered by the process; its duration; whether the process grants additional or takes away benefits provided under a collective agreement or by provincial laws, is the employer's responsibility.It is not the Commission's role to approve or reject the employer's plan. The Commission confines itself to determining, in the case of a claimant who left their employment, whether the workforce reduction measures taken by the employer are consistent with the regulatory text.It is extremely important, therefore, that the group covered by the workforce reduction process be identified. If the claimant does not fall within this group, it cannot be said that they voluntarily left employment under this process. The group may be all of the employees, or be limited to a sector, a particular group, or a work site.(b) The objective of the workforce reduction process is a permanent reduction in the overall number of employees in the business;The process established by the employer must lead to a permanent reduction in the total number of employees. This means that at the end of the process the business will have a workforce smaller than the one existing before implementation. There are many different combinations of an employer's workforce that an employer must take into account when determining what will be the overall number that must be reduced. Thus, the overall number of employees may also include seasonal, temporary or on call employees.In other words, even if no worker took advantage of the employer's offer, the employer would consider laying off from within all categories of workers, including seasonal, temporary or on call, or reduce the possibility or frequency of the recall of these employees, in order to reduce the workforce by the numbers initially anticipated.Workforce reduction in a small business might conceivably affect as few as only one employee and, if it meets the criteria, allow a claimant who has voluntarily left employment to avoid a disqualification under the Act.Favourable economic conditions, a sudden increase in demand, access to new markets, or the marketing of new products are all factors influencing the business and future workforce levels. These factors are not relevant in determining whether the process is consistent with the Regulation. It is the situation that is prevailing at the time the company instituted the workforce reduction process that is relevant and must be considered.The Regulation does not require that employees who are leaving employment permanently preserve the employment of a co-worker. It is the reduction in the employer's workforce that must be permanent; the saving of the employment of a co-worker does not have the same requirement. Workforce reduction processes that reduce the workforce to a certain level and then, after a few weeks or months, further reduce the workforce to zero, also qualify for the workforce reduction exemption. The employee who takes advantage of the workforce reduction process in this manner during the first reduction of staff is saving the employment of the co-worker who remains until closure.(c) The workforce reduction process offers employees the option to voluntarily leave employment;The employer must offer the employees covered by the workforce reduction process the option of voluntarily leaving their employment. All employees, or a particular group of employees, are offered the option of voluntarily leaving employment in order to preserve the employment of a co-worker who would otherwise be let go. Only an employee who has voluntarily left their employment under a workforce reduction process can take advantage of the Regulation.Employees who leave voluntarily to protect the employment of a co-worker may retain recall rights or some other employment fringe benefit for a period of time after their employment ceases. These recall rights may be retained, for example, in order to be entitled to the payment of severance pay or some other employment benefit. In such cases, as long as permanent workforce reduction exists and the recall rights do not alter that permanent reduction, employees who leave under the program may be covered under the Regulation, if the program meets all the other criteria.(d) The elements of the workforce reduction process are to be documented by the employer.The employer must furnish the Commission with information indicating that this is in fact a permanent reduction in the workforce, that personnel were informed, and that the employees covered by this process were given the option of voluntarily leaving their employment.This might take the form of a letter, a notice, a memorandum or some other relevant documentation. The workforce reduction process may be part of or outside of the collective agreement.Hypothetical situations or vague uncorroborated statements concerning possible or potential reductions are not acceptable.Stage two:The second stage covers the individual claimant.Once it has been decided that the employer's work force reduction process meets the conditions specified in the Regulation, fact-finding is required for each individual claimant. The employer's confirmation can take a number of forms. The employer and the agent responsible for conducting the fact-finding on the workforce reduction process may agree on a procedure that best fulfils the requirements of the parties and this may involve a contact person with the employer.To facilitate the fact-finding, employers are informed to note the Comments block of the Record of Employment (ROE). Even though the ROE is so indicated, it must be confirmed that the employer's workforce reduction process meets the conditions of Regulation 51(2). This is usually done by the process that the Region has in place for exchange of information on workforce reduction.A worker voluntarily leaving employment under a work force reduction process must complete an application for benefits. The agent will then verify whether it can be concluded from the documents provided to the Commission that the claimant voluntarily left their employment under a workforce reduction process that complies with the regulatory provisions. The agent must also be able to conclude that the claimant's departure resulted in the preservation of the employment of a co-worker who would have otherwise been let go in the course of the workforce reduction process. This conclusion can only be made after confirmation by the employer.It is not necessary to identify by name the co-worker who preserved their employment through the claimant's departure. However, the employer must confirm that someone would have lost their employment under this workforce reduction process and that the claimant's departure under this process resulted in the preservation of a co-worker's employment.",41.12616501488054,13.64469097633564,15.87906417309062,17.94236181340114,15.753495911468114,14.037611026033687,60.47611892860239,8.830188679245284,2.8824089237578177,0.6892468008656772,0.4574442798621844,0.0661008549103999,0.8590728623362688,0.851423932056801,5.278713629402756,4.0,2.9939382657505003,24.641509433962263,22.0,11.645866283587235,1.663093415007657,1.0,0.9193184033015046,1306,368,0.2817764165390505,7039,53,6.7.3,Definition by regulation,Chapter 6 - Voluntarily leaving employment

alternative:continue to work during the period preceding the period for which maternity benefits are payable, while her state of pregnancy permits;request a leave of absence with the intention to

situation involving co-workers rather than the employer;situation which is similar to the circumstances defined in par. 29(c)(i) which does not specify the author of the harassment.Reference:EIA

of 40 Main Circumstances to Take Into Consideration (Alphabetical Order),Chapter 6 - Voluntarily leaving employment
433,433,"Employment Insurance benefits are  intended to provide temporary financial assistance to those who, through no  fault of their own, become unemployed.  Under the Employment Insurance  Act a claimant who has lost their employment by reason of their own misconduct  is disqualified from receiving benefits.   Likewise, those who are suspended from employment due to misconduct are  disentitled from receiving benefits.A finding that misconduct led to the separation from employment  will therefore prevent a person from receiving  regular benefits for all weeks of the benefit period for which benefits would  otherwise be payable following the waiting period.A decision to disqualify or disentitle a claimant because of  their misconduct is only rendered after comprehensive and well-documented  fact-finding has been conducted, to fully support the decision.  The word  misconduct is not defined in the legislation. When this word is  used in a legislative context, it is the prerogative of the courts to interpret  it. It is therefore a question of law. Over the years, jurisprudence has made a  number of clarifications to the interpretation of the word  misconduct. In general,  misconduct refers to ill-intentioned actions by an employee; actions that are  incompatible with the reliable and suitable carrying out of the duties for  which the employee was hired. These are actions that result in the person who  worked for an employer and committed these infractions, no longer meeting the  expressed or implicit conditions of employment or work. It is not  necessary that the misconduct occur during work or at the workplace or even  while carrying out duties for the employer. An offence committed outside of  work could amount to misconduct, if the infraction was such that the conditions  of employment were no longer met, and it led to the dismissal. While this is not  an absolute principle, it can also be said that in order to constitute  misconduct, the actions or omissions alleged must have been voluntary or  willful or of such a careless or negligent nature that one could say the  employee willfully disregarded the effects their actions would have on their  ability to fulfill the conditions of their employment.  Misconduct involves the claimant's own  behaviour, or responsibilities for which they were personally accountable.  Association with a group of individuals is not incriminating in itself, but  group misconduct does not relieve the individual of the responsibility for their  actions. The question of  whether or not a particular action or omission of an employee is covered by the  interpretation given to the word misconduct by the courts is a question of  fact, which will be dealt with in later sections. The legal test to determine  whether a finding of misconduct can be made is then applied to the facts of the  case.  Misconduct is thus a mixed  question of law and fact (A-64-06, A-319-14). It is not appropriate to question  whether the employer was right or wrong to dismiss or suspend the claimant, or  whether the alleged misconduct was sufficiently serious to justify the  employee's dismissal or suspension.  It  is the facts of an individual case which decide whether the claimant's actions  or omissions constitute misconduct under the EI Act, and whether or not the  employment was lost by reason of that misconduct(A-274-05, A-200-09, A-319-14).When the claimant denies having committed the  action or omission alleged by the employer, the Commission must obtain, from  the employer, evidence that the claimant did in fact commit the act or omission,  or evidence that the claimant admitted to it.   The claimant must then be advised of the employer's statement and  alleged reason for dismissal and be given the opportunity to rebut the evidence  provided.  Finally, the Commission will  have to demonstrate that the alleged action or omission is directly connected  to the dismissal and that it constitutes misconduct under the Act (A-636-85, A-573-04, A-473-06, A-558-12, A-198-11). In summary, what must be  determined is:whether the claimant lost their employment  because of the alleged offence (action or omission)whether the claimant committed the alleged  offence; andwhether the alleged offence constitutes  misconductThe sections which follow further describe the process for making  these determinations.",43.7441666666667,14.941968085106383,16.27048610459338,19.288652482269505,16.872225177304962,11.51372340425532,62.317375886524815,9.708333333333334,3.2333941363099963,0.82249817861363,0.4672522215929888,0.0676544594739814,0.861991682778234,0.8705718598582528,4.805851063829787,4.0,3.139838019122747,31.33333333333333,27.5,17.37255178595118,1.5518617021276595,1.0,0.8797193350911828,752,263,0.3497340425531915,3630,24,7.1.0,Introduction  (A mixed question of law and fact),Chapter 7 - Misconduct
434,434,"The authority related to the Commission's  treatment of misconduct is found in the EI Act. While sections 29 and 30 of the EI Act are those that are primarily used when  adjudicating cases of misconduct, the following is a list of related sections  of the Act. Subsection 29(a) - defines  employment (subsection 2(1))  also defines employment).Subsection 30(1) - provides that a  claimant is disqualified from receiving benefits if they lost any employment  because of their misconduct unless(a) the claimant has, since losing or  leaving the employment, been employed in insurable employment for the number of  hours required by section 7 or 7.1 to qualify to receive benefits; or(b) the  claimant is disentitled under sections 31 to 33 in relation to the employment.Subsection 30(2) - defines the  length of the disqualification.Subsection 30(3) - explains that a  disqualification is effective from the week of the event.Subsection 30(4) - provides that the  disqualification will be suspended during any week for which the claimant is  otherwise entitled to special benefits (sickness, maternity, parental,  compassionate care or family caregiver benefits).Section 31 - provides that a  disentitlement is imposed if a claimant is suspended due to misconduct.  It also provides details on the duration of  the disentitlement and the conditions to end it.Section 33 - provides for a  disentitlement if a claimant loses their employment due to misconduct within 3 weeks of an anticipated loss of employment.Section 34 - provides that a  disentitlement under sections 31 to 33 is suspended for any week in which the  claimant is otherwise entitled to special benefits.Subsection 49(2) - requires that the  Commission give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant if the evidence  submitted by the claimant and the employer is different but equally credible.Section 51 - states that the  Commission is obligated to give both the claimant and the employer the  opportunity to provide information as to the reasons for the loss of employment  in order to gather the facts necessary to make a decision.",41.64214452214455,15.37819217819218,17.015998829145012,20.17104377104377,17.725656565656564,12.236809116809113,65.52732452732452,10.727272727272728,2.92148398916379,0.6614766400479549,0.5073565406958843,0.0524362061561211,0.8835503995418549,0.8535988065931532,4.925925925925926,4.0,3.491166742692515,31.90909090909091,28.0,19.704427492569213,1.5698005698005697,1.0,1.0127954685336504,351,144,0.4102564102564102,1745,11,7.1.1,Authority,Chapter 7 - Misconduct

440,440,"It is the Commission's responsibility  to gather all of the information required to determine whether or not the  claimant lost their employment by reason of their own misconduct.  In doing so, the Commission shall, as  specified in section 51 of the EI Act:give the claimant and the employer the opportunity to provide information as to the reasons for the loss of employmentif the information is provided, take it into account in determining the claimThe officer's role is to  gather all the relevant information so a decision can be made within the  legislative framework required without delay. This means that all interested  parties are given the opportunity to provide information on the reasons for the  separation, and to rebut the version provided by the other party, if necessary. The first statement regarding the reason for separation often  comes from the claimant when providing information on their application for benefits.Fact-finding by the  officer with the employer will then take place to obtain the employer's version  of the reason for separation.  This will  be followed with a rebuttal or clarification by the claimant, if necessary, or  even fact-finding with anyone else who may be able to shed light on the loss of  employment. Naturally, to the extent possible, the information will be sought  from those directly involved or eyewitness to the events, particularly if there  are discrepancies between versions already obtained. For example the employer's bookkeeper  may have completed the ROE and be identified as the point of  contact, when in reality the bookkeeper completed the form at the direction of  the person who actually dismissed the claimant and the bookkeeper's information is  only indirect.The officer will adapt their fact-finding to the specific circumstances of  the case; for example, if there are indications the dismissal was related to  trauma or incidents resulting from harassment, abuse or violence. The  Commission's policy in such a situation is to offer the claimant the  opportunity to speak to an officer of the same gender to provide the  information needed for processing the claim.  An officer must not expect an alleged victim of violence to openly discuss  the events that took place, to have kept a record of the steps taken to remedy  the situation or to have taken an approach that lends itself to supporting a  claim for EI benefits. The officer will endeavour to obtain only the basic information the claimant  agrees to provide and will, of course, be discreet and considerate. In some  cases, the officer may consider gathering testimony from other persons who, in  the claimant's opinion, are familiar with the situation. Every effort must be  made to deal with the claimant in a compassionate, professional and reassuring  manner. The officer will ask the employer to provide required information on the  reason for separation. The officer will simply take the employer's version, and  at no time at this stage in the gathering of facts will the officer reveal to the  employer the account given by the claimant unless the claimant agrees to such  disclosure or the employer mentions the details specifically. Both employers and claimants alike are expected to act in good faith and submit evidence in support of their  allegations.The statements of both the claimant and employer are reviewed and  compared.  Any discrepancies,  contradictions, or additional information given or required are noted. The  other party (claimant or employer) is then given the opportunity to  respond.  Final rebuttal will always be  given to the claimant.  There must be no  allegations on file that have not been presented to the claimant with an  opportunity for explanation or clarification. The officer cannot guarantee confidentiality to the person providing the information. They can, however, stress that the legislation provides that any person who gives the Commission written, oral or documentary evidence required for the proper determination of the entitlement to benefits, the giving of the evidence is an occasion of qualified privilege (EIA 129).The Commission must not rely on this specific provision as a means to  obtain facts. The officer must never offer advice as to whether this provision  would protect the information provided, in any specific case. If the person  providing the information wishes to seek legal counsel regarding the  applicability of this provision prior to releasing the information, a  reasonable period of time will be allowed. While a disentitlement due to lack of information  can be imposed, this should be considered only as a last resort when reasonable  attempts to obtain the relevant information have been unsuccessful. A disentitlement  must never be imposed when a claimant has acted in good faith and frankly disclosed all the information they have.  Even if the situation remains ambiguous,  whether because the employer chooses not to disclose certain facts or the  employer's version is different, the officer relies solely on the balance of  probabilities, with particular attention given to the credibility of the  evidence (Digest 7.2.3).",44.19452164009115,14.616447254732542,15.317112822102056,18.12401225355432,16.57664401853743,11.771799544419135,60.11640876600424,9.03448275862069,2.95134048492238,0.7314672962374551,0.4786873556959597,0.0518263502145978,0.9002101400068828,0.8819516919277333,4.855353075170843,4.0,3.066207514175264,30.27586206896552,25.0,14.701387576369456,1.5592255125284735,1.0,0.9464116821716294,878,304,0.3462414578587699,4290,29,7.2.1,Step one: Gather relevant information from various sources,Chapter 7 - Misconduct
441,441,"To determine whether or not a claimant was dismissed for reasons of  misconduct, the employer is asked to provide the Commission with information  concerning the reason for the termination of employment, specifying, among  other things: what actions  or omissions caused the employer to dismiss the employee; (i.e. their exact  nature, context and background)why the employer felt that such actions or omissions  warranted dismissal of the employeewhether such action  or omission violated a provision of the contract of employment or a policy or  rule of the employer or an essential condition of the employmentwhat information the employer relied on to conclude  that the employee committed the action  or omission in question (i.e. testimony, investigations, reports, other sources  of information)whether the person in question had been previously  informed of the employer's rules, policies, requirements or expectationswhat reasons the claimant gave for these actions or omissionsif the employer became aware of such action or omission some time before  dismissing the employee, and the reason for the time elapsed before the  termination of employment (details of the dates involved should be obtained)Criminal offences or  violations of employment statutes do not generally give rise to different  procedures or a different line of questioning for the fact-finding with regard  to the termination of employment. In some instances, obtaining the appropriate  information concerning a person's actions may prove difficult. The employer  may, for example, be reluctant to provide information if a Court or labour  arbitration decision is still pending. The officer will make the  need for detailed information clear to the employer, particularly with regard  to the actions attributed to the claimant and in what context the incidents  occurred. Unless a Court has ordered a publication ban, the employer should be  able to divulge sufficient information without adversely affecting any action  or proceedings against the claimant. For example, it is not necessary to  provide all the details of an inquiry or the list of those named as witnesses. In some instances the  information at the employer's disposal may be limited, such as when the incident  occurred outside the work place.  A mere  disclosure of the charges with no further detail does not generally provide  enough information concerning the actions or omissions attributed to the  claimant or the elements relied upon to conclude that the claimant committed  such actions or omissions (A-130-96, CUB 76247). Depending on  the circumstances, a newspaper article describing the events and the alleged  involvement of a person may constitute a valid written form of hearsay where  information or details cannot be obtained from persons with more direct  knowledge of the events. When the employer refuses to provide  information related to the reason for separation, they are advised that failure  to do so may result in the claimant receiving benefits.",20.72310160965796,22.715736418511074,20.17186042781802,27.042977867203223,27.31116700201208,13.430342052313884,85.11247484909457,17.6,3.170092058083489,0.5280042340760365,0.4843127084142045,0.0594743351258552,0.8866528736220466,0.8997046500444412,5.072434607645875,4.0,3.279529937033184,49.7,29.5,59.57188934388434,1.6036217303822935,1.0,0.920276269521326,497,212,0.4265593561368209,2527,10,7.2.1.1,Fact-finding with the employer,Chapter 7 - Misconduct

In some cases, the  officer may feel that the accounts of the parties are equally credible, making  it impossible to choose one version over another. The benefit of  the doubt is not given simply because there are contradictory versions of an  incident or event. The officer must first determine whether or not one version  is more credible than the other. If yes, the decision is made on the basis of  the version of the facts the officer deems to be more credible. If not, the  benefit of the doubt is given to the claimant.The method to determine credibility is often  based on the evidence.  For example, if  the employer has the names of five individuals who witnessed an altercation but  the claimant alone disputes their version, the employer's version of events  would be considered more credible, as there is supporting evidence (CUB 76736).It should be noted that the versions given by the  parties, even if they appear contradictory, may not necessarily be incompatible  with respect to determining the reason for the separation from employment.

Wilfulness also exists  when the action was so negligent or careless that it appears deliberate.Wilfulness means that the evidence reasonably leads to the conclusion  the claimant knew the conduct was prohibited or neglectful, but chose to  continue the course of conduct anyway.   It does not matter whether or not the claimant meant to harm the  employer.  Intent is irrelevant in a  finding of wilfulness (A-296-03, A-51-10; CUB 55140).

451,451,"It must be shown there was a causal relationship between the loss of  employment and the final incident described by the employer and/or claimant. A causal relationship means the  employee was dismissed as a direct result of the alleged actions. There is a  definite connection between what the employee did, or didn't do, and the  dismissal from employment.  The  Commission cannot make a finding of misconduct if an employer imposes a milder  punishment and later decides to dismiss the employee for the same infraction (A-152-96).  For example, if the employer suspends an  employee for three days at the end of May, and then dismisses the employee for the  same act (not a subsequent repetition of the same act) on July 31, it suggests  there may be another reason for the dismissal.   It would be difficult to prove the misconduct in May caused the loss of  employment, even if all other elements required for a finding of misconduct are  present.  If the action occurred in May,  but the employer did not learn of it until July, whereupon they immediately  dismissed the employee, it is likely that the dismissal arises from the action. A  delay may occur if, prior to the dismissal, the claimant was suspended following  the incident while the employer conducted an investigation.  In such cases, despite the delay, a  determination of misconduct may be made. Dismissal for cause is not the same as dismissal for misconduct. In both  instances there may be a direct relationship between an action of the employee  and a dismissal from employment (A-875-96, A-1342-92).  Although the employer may be justified in  ending the employment, a simple correlation of an action and dismissal does not  in itself lead to a finding of misconduct.  Claimants may state the employer used an incident as an  excuse to dismiss or suspend them from employment.  If all the other elements of misconduct are  present, the claimant's statement alone is not enough to prevent a refusal of  benefits.  Employees whose conduct is undesirable  are accountable for their behaviour.  The  employer may have taken advantage of the opportunity, but the Commission does  not have to consider the employer's other reasons for choosing to dismiss an  employee.  The only question is whether  there was an incident of misconduct that resulted in dismissal (A-1040-87).When the breach seems to be over a relatively small issue,  or when there is a significant lag between the alleged event and the dismissal,  there may be other matters at play.  Fact  finding must secure evidence to establish the true reason for dismissal, to determine  whether misconduct has occurred (A-385-11).",53.925833333333344,12.3625,14.314028922438442,16.416666666666668,13.206270833333337,9.684749999999998,54.16666666666667,7.333333333333333,3.0822990520926536,0.9290245598742491,0.4856692743483248,0.0636446907379708,0.8657840525402742,0.8603056743741035,4.522916666666666,3.0,2.920383792082054,26.666666666666668,25.0,10.9188929027728,1.4875,1.0,0.8087091050969235,480,182,0.3791666666666666,2185,18,7.2.4.5,Real reason for loss of employment (causal relationship),Chapter 7 - Misconduct
452,452,"The word misconduct is not defined in the legislation.  Over the years jurisprudence has made a number  of clarifications to its interpretation.   As a result, its meaning under the EI  Act has evolved to be conduct which must be wilful or at least of such a  careless or negligent nature that one could say the employee wilfully  disregarded the effects their actions would have on their ability to fulfill  the conditions of their employment.  It  requires an element of wilfulness, or conduct so reckless as to approach wilfulness (A-381-85, A-1342-92, A-296-03, A-72-02, A-558-12, A-51-10). In other words, to be considered misconduct under the EI Act, the actions must be intentional or negligent to the point of being deemed  a breach of an obligation arising explicitly or implicitly from the contract of  employment; otherwise there is no misconduct.Misconduct is not mere failure to perform an obligation  associated with the employment. It is a failure of such magnitude that the  individual responsible for the action could predict, as a normal outcome, their dismissal or suspension.Employers do not necessarily share the same definition of  misconduct as that found in jurisprudence, and it is sometimes difficult to  ascertain the cause of dismissal. Many times, employers express that they had no alternative  but to dismiss the employee as progressive discipline failed to rectify the  behaviour, or that the degree of incompetence or negligence was so great that  immediate termination was warranted.Sometimes an employee, despite their best efforts, is unable  to do a job and is dismissed.  This is  not considered misconduct.  A genuine  lack of skill, aptitude or ability does not suggest a deliberate action that  reflects wilful behaviour.  Likewise, a  personality conflict between an employee and a supervisor does not represent wilfulness (CUB 36177, CUB 75215).  If the evidence concludes the employee was  not suited to the job, this in itself does not imply wilfulness or misconduct.Inappropriate behaviour in the workplace can be the result  of incompetence, negligence or misconduct, any one of which an employer could  consider grounds for dismissal. For these reasons, especially given the consequences  of a finding of misconduct under the EI Act, thorough fact-finding and the  application of these facts to the judicial interpretation of misconduct is a  necessity. An employer may well have cause for dismissing an individual, but dismissal does not automatically translate into  misconduct under the EI Act.  Care must  be taken to ensure that a decision to deny benefits is not taken solely on an  employer's assurance that the conduct in question is misconduct, or exclusively  on the employer's subjective appreciation of the events (A-732-95).The employer is not required to prove that the actions or omissions in question  constitute misconduct under the Act nor is the Commission to rely on the employer's belief that the actions in question constituted  misconduct.",43.827398989899024,14.281686009026432,16.04434344847333,18.60687728347303,15.54275521169138,11.397988394584145,59.283150655491085,8.777777777777779,3.182426856528345,1.0826389146946946,0.4624746199731546,0.0457842096456895,0.8386404198758742,0.8268231078982353,4.800773694390716,4.0,3.205556011578944,28.72222222222222,24.5,17.28456458345151,1.5822050290135397,1.0,0.9117291649107152,517,222,0.4294003868471953,2505,18,7.2.5,Interpretation of the meaning of misconduct,Chapter 7 - Misconduct
453,453,"In practice it is not always  easy for the officer to determine whether the loss of employment was due to a  voluntary leaving or a dismissal. A person having to choose between resigning  or being dismissed may decide to leave the job in order to preserve their work  record. On the other hand, a person who does not advise the employer of a  prolonged absence from work could be viewed as a person who wants to leave  employment to the point of leading to a dismissal. The sections of the legislation that address voluntary  leaving and dismissal are inextricably linked.   In either case, the claimant has acted in such a manner that avoidable  loss of employment resulted. It does not matter whether  the case is one of loss of employment through misconduct or voluntary  separation without just cause provided that a disqualification would be  warranted in either case. Both grounds could be mentioned in the notice of  disqualification sent to the claimant (A-1398-92, A-78-04, A-562-04). This does not mean the officer may simply determine the  loss of employment somehow resulted from the claimant's own actions.   The Commission must gather and evaluate the  facts.  The final decision must reflect  the facts considered and whether a determination of dismissal due to  misconduct, or voluntary separation without just cause, is more valid.  The decision would involve who initiated the act of severing the  employment and the reasons behind this action.There may be situations for which an original reason for the separation  from employment has been changed as a result of a grievance. This does not alter  the facts of the case nor the events that gave rise to the cessation of  employment (A-291-98, A-319-14). There may be situations, such as in the case of a constructive  dismissal, where the employer simply wanted to get rid of the employee. Constructive  dismissal may involve, the employer unilaterally making substantial changes to  the terms of employment, such as reduction in salary, demotion, removal of  compensation or benefits or transfer to another location.  Employees subjected to such changes may decide  to quit the employment.  Once all facts  of the case are obtained, it may be found to be a case of constructive  dismissal without misconduct, or that the voluntary leaving was with just  cause.",57.97937367752857,11.266158837635777,13.310731037718623,14.991620820990269,12.419382141345745,9.93976019184652,50.42869234024545,6.352941176470588,2.9896262690435083,0.6128341518371506,0.4843859461594808,0.0526845923770257,0.8539201356470585,0.8751515944798788,4.58273381294964,4.0,2.957490868708976,24.529411764705884,25.0,7.76203162503844,1.4652278177458034,1.0,0.827793292235337,417,170,0.407673860911271,1918,17,7.2.5.1,Loss of employment due to voluntary leaving or misconduct,Chapter 7 - Misconduct
454,454,"Progressive discipline is a process by which an employer  imposes increasingly severe sanctions for repeated behaviour.  Progressive discipline often follows a  written policy or provisions of a collective agreement that describe exactly  what process must occur before an employee can be dismissed.  Evidence that an employer tried to correct  undesirable conduct and imposed increased sanctions for repeat occurrences can  be evidence of a progressive discipline process. Progressive discipline may be a lengthy process.  For example, some employers may follow  procedures which require that three verbal warnings be documented to the  personnel file, followed by three written warnings, suspension and a warning  that a further infraction may result in dismissal. Progressive discipline policies may include provisions to  assist an employee who suffers from an addiction that affects job  performance. The common elements in progressive discipline are:the employee is warned that a behaviour will not  be tolerated and is given an opportunity to correct that behaviour the employer applies increasingly more serious  consequences for repeated offencesthe employee is warned that their employment is  at risk There must be specific evidence to conclude progressive  discipline.  This includes some or all of  the following:a copy of the company policy evidence that the employee received and  understood the policy, such as a signed (written or electronic) confirmation of  receipt of that policy dates and details of previous infraction(s) and  the disciplinary actions imposed documentation showing the employee was given an  opportunity to defend or discuss the alleged misconductdate and details of the final warning date and details of the final incident and  dismissal The progressive discipline sequence must be in regard to a  single, specific behaviour.  The evidence  must show the employee understood another incident could, or would, result in  suspension or dismissal.  An employee who  is dismissed for tardiness, but the last warning was two years ago and the  current infraction is minor, may lack the element of wilfulness in the final  incident. The Commission must look at whether the final incident was  wilful.  For example, an employee who is  late for work because a power failure re-set their alarm clock is tardy  due to a circumstance over which there is no control.  The element of wilfulness is missing in that  final incident.  The employer may be  within their rights to end the employment, but the claimant is not necessarily  refused EI benefits even though the employee may have a  history of being late. Some employers have policies that say breaking any three rules will result in  suspension or dismissal.  This means that  an employee may, for example, be warned for being tardy and can never be late  again.  The same employee may be warned  about a dress code violation and subsequently always attend the workplace  appropriately attired.  The employee may  then be warned that any further infraction of the rules will result in  dismissal.  The employee may then be  dismissed for failing to follow a minor procedure, although the infraction  would not normally lead to dismissal.   This is not progressive  discipline.  In the example above, the  disciplinary action following each infraction successfully controlled the  behaviour.  The Commission must follow  the normal process in determining whether the final incident was one of  misconduct.If there is no formal process, the evidence must show the  nature of the warnings and what, if any, sanctions were applied to the  employee.  For example, if an employee is  told they have to get to work on time, but is not warned of any consequences,  it is impossible to conclude the employee understood that being late was  considered so serious as to warrant the loss of employment.  When the employer does not intervene, it  appears the employer condones, or accepts the undesirable conduct. Progressive discipline must be in relation to conduct that  both lies within the employee's control and affects the employment relationship (A-416-08).",47.47865384615386,13.43055555555556,15.350803472480044,17.63325760034621,15.064384939954556,11.60787623066104,59.835605322947096,8.884615384615385,3.0066094619950827,0.7986644240278941,0.4691019443981863,0.0680713072590725,0.8604558539390564,0.8491719787319502,4.8452883263009845,4.0,3.083685512078429,27.346153846153847,22.0,18.2544879786026,1.5555555555555556,1.0,0.8109270931654426,711,245,0.3445850914205344,3432,26,7.2.5.2,Progressive discipline,Chapter 7 - Misconduct

456,456,"While it is not mandatory that the misconduct occurred  during the employment, there must always be a causal link between the  misconduct and the loss of employment.   Misconduct can result from an act or omission that occurred prior to the  start of an employment from which the employee is later dismissed in situations  where the misconduct is the direct cause for the dismissal (A-239-06).The Act speaks of a loss of any employment as a  result of misconduct and does not limit a disqualification to the employment  occupied at the time of the misconduct. The relationship between employment and  misconduct is not one of timing but of causation (A-875-96, A-732-95, A-236-94, A-352-94, A-96-95, A-462-10, A-337-07). A case illustrating this occurred in which a claimant was  charged with a driving offence and was awaiting a court date.  During this time, the claimant accepted a position as a  driver where maintaining a valid driver's permit was a condition of  employment.  When the case was decided in  Provincial Court, the claimant's driving privileges were suspended for one  year. The claimant therefore had to resign their  employment.

457,457,"There will be situations for which it has been decided the  claimant was dismissed due to their own misconduct and later the employer and  claimant may agree on a settlement agreement.   They may settle for a certain financial sum or the initial reason for  separation may be changed to resignation instead of dismissal and all  references to termination removed from the former employee's file.  The question then becomes whether such  agreements have an impact on the decision of misconduct originally made by the  Commission and whether voluntary leaving should now be considered.The answer lies in the terms used in the agreement.  An agreement is not by itself sufficient to  overturn a finding of misconduct based on all the evidence on file.  In order to contradict a previous finding of  misconduct, an agreement must contain some evidence which can legitimately  contradict the employer's original position with respect to the reason for separation (A-294-06).  The agent will consider the new facts in  addition to the information already on file, compare them against the initial  decision and determine whether the agreement casts doubt on the claimant's  misconduct. If so, it then becomes a case of voluntary leaving (A-170-98).An agreement that includes a without prejudice clause  (which generally expresses that neither party will make statements on the  issue) is not generally admissible in evidence as proof that the loss of employment  was not due to misconduct and does not constitute new facts that could alter or  affect the outcome of the original decision of misconduct (A-233-94, A-45-96).If it is determined that, based on the additional facts from  the agreement, the loss of employment is not due to misconduct, the question  then becomes one of voluntary leaving and will be adjudicated based on guidance  from Chapter 6 of this Digest.",40.13305555555559,17.722901234567903,16.52667757954773,21.6320987654321,21.236111111111107,11.453580246913582,71.3641975308642,12.5,3.146272843964665,0.8130047890245105,0.5224255230826724,0.0677710838139573,0.8834907923425946,0.8878615299860636,4.75925925925926,4.0,2.911886146947479,40.5,34.5,31.476181471074284,1.4845679012345678,1.0,0.7874847431525669,324,152,0.4691358024691358,1548,8,7.2.5.5,Settlement reached since dismissed,Chapter 7 - Misconduct
458,458,"EI provides regular benefits to  individuals who lose their jobs through no fault of their own, are available  for and able to work, but have not yet found a job.  The Federal Court of Appeal has clearly established  that it is the circumstances which exist at the time the claimant leaves their  employment that are relevant to the determination of the reason for separation.  The circumstances that may occur after that  time do not have any bearing on the reason the claimant left their employment (EIA 129).  When an employee submits a notice of  resignation and the terms are accepted by the employer but the employee is  released due to misconduct prior to the agreed-upon date of the resignation for  reasons unrelated to the resignation, the separation must be considered due to  misconduct.  If the claimant resigns and  as a consequence is released prior to the effective date, it will be considered  voluntary leaving.  Situational advice  follows.  7.2.5.6.1  Notice period not worked - No compensation for the notice periodIf a claimant gives the employer notice that they are  leaving employment on a specific date and the employer advises the claimant to  leave prior to that date, but does not keep them on the payroll for the notice  period, the reason for separation is adjudicated as voluntary leaving and not  dismissal from employment, as it was the claimant who initiated the separation.  Guidance can be found in Chapter 6 of this Digest.  If a disqualification is to be imposed, the  effective date will be the specified date of resignation, not the date the  employer asked them to leave.  The notice  of resignation must have been formal (verbal or written), and not just a  statement to the effect that they planned on leaving or were looking for other  employment.7.2.5.6.2  Notice period not worked - Compensation received for the notice periodSituations in which the employer advises the claimant to  leave immediately but continues to pay them up to the effective date of  resignation requested by the employee, are treated as cases of voluntary  leaving ,not dismissal prior to voluntary leaving.   Again,  in this situation, it was the claimant who initiated the separation from  employment, regardless of whether or not they continue to work or get  paid.  These cases would be adjudicated  according to provisions in Chapter 6 of this Digest.7.2.5.6.3  Notice period not worked - Partial compensation for the notice periodSituations in which an employer partially  compensates the claimant for the notice period are cases of voluntary leaving  as per provisions in Chapter 6 of this Digest.   Any applicable disqualification is effective from the date specified  in the letter of resignation.7.2.5.6.4  Dismissal for misconduct prior to the end of the notice period When an employer dismisses the claimant prior to the  resignation date, for reasons of misconduct, the adjudication principles for  misconduct are used.  The act that caused  the dismissal could have occurred prior to or after the claimant handed in  their resignation.  In either case, when  fact finding is complete, the adjudication principles set out in this chapter of the Digest (dependent on the reason) would be applied. If misconduct is not proven, a subsequent disqualification for  voluntary leaving cannot be imposed.   This is because the reason the claimant is unemployed is no longer due  to resignation, but rather dismissal.",45.27330931047918,15.771106349824702,15.978110994213203,19.90712894429295,18.535649590962212,11.08271523178808,62.01947798987145,9.411764705882351,3.161607342201403,1.100690244110751,0.5006156180497792,0.071553176212569,0.8499063327908516,0.8592464208602906,4.7135761589403975,4.0,3.2600960544031388,35.529411764705884,29.0,21.95213415072954,1.4834437086092715,1.0,0.8753754512242812,604,191,0.3162251655629139,2835,17,7.2.5.6,Dismissal after resignation,Chapter 7 - Misconduct
459,459,"In addition to setting out the principles that establish  misconduct, case law also identifies specific conduct that equates to  misconduct.  The following sections  address particular circumstances the law identifies as misconduct. The acts and omissions discussed below represent fundamental  aspects of the employer-employee relationship.   The payment of benefits rests on whether the employee was responsible  for breaching such an aspect.  It is  important to note that either the employer or employee may breach the  employment relationship.  The EI Act does not offer redress to an employee who has suffered an undue  dismissal, nor is it intended to judge the actions of the employer.  Employees have other avenues by which to seek  assistance in cases of unjust dismissal.   The Commission's responsibility is to determine whether employees who  claim benefits have lost work as a result of actions over which they had  control, and to determine whether they can receive regular benefits. As mentioned previously, the  word misconduct is not defined in the legislation. Rather,  jurisprudence has, over the years, provided a number of clarifications  concerning the interpretation of this word in the legislative context. The same  is true with regard to the specific actions  or omissions covered by this interpretation. They are not included as such in  the legislation, but have been identified in jurisprudence. As mentioned earlier, one of  the two questions which the Commission officer must specifically answer is  whether or not the claimant committed the actions or omissions covered by the interpretation given to the word  misconduct in the jurisprudence. The following sections deal with  the most frequent actions or  omissions in which elements characteristic of misconduct are found.",46.90500000000003,12.040476190476191,14.95560836045872,16.571428571428573,13.022685714285714,12.453866666666665,56.0952380952381,7.428571428571429,2.769245251443765,0.5615410490245607,0.4964977910155342,0.06540408770502,0.8703009073550885,0.8537066380182902,5.04,4.0,3.335426009772465,21.428571428571427,18.5,8.050858744917354,1.6333333333333333,1.0,0.9826268648655784,300,141,0.47,1508,14,7.3.0,Misconduct relating to actions or omissions,Chapter 7 - Misconduct
460,460,"An employer has the right to expect employees to report to work in a  regular manner and remain on the job until their work period is over. Regular  attendance at work is without any doubt a significant determinant of the  productivity of a business. Thus, it is necessary for any employee wanting time  off or foreseeing an absence to first inform the employer and seek permission. In some instances, absences are not foreseeable, such as in the case of a  last-minute occurrence beyond the employee's control or an emergency requiring  the employee to abruptly leave work or preventing them from reporting to work.  An employee has a duty to inform the employer  before leaving the workplace or, depending on the situation, notify the  employer as soon as possible that it was not possible to remain at or report to  work. Absence from work means any situation in which the employee  should be present and is not.  This  includes failing to come to work; being late to report in or leaving before the  end of a shift (CUB 66381A, CUB 74804); taking breaks at non-scheduled times, leaving early  for or coming back late from a break. An employee must make necessary arrangements to be at work  on the agreed upon times. If the absence is foreseeable, the employee is  expected to notify and explain the situation to the employer.If a person is unable to report to work as a result of an  addiction and as a result, is dismissed, that person is considered to have lost  the job as a result of misconduct (A-85-06, A-582-98, A-570-00, A-255-03, A-315-05).   The absence from work is the result of voluntary, deliberate or even  reckless behaviour taken by the person even though they knew or ought to have  known that this could result in dismissal.",55.6377272727273,12.951818181818188,13.88584557914918,16.72727272727273,13.666000000000004,8.301333333333332,50.30303030303031,6.090909090909091,3.016314254127614,0.6787651850697461,0.483101282258305,0.0572885377603101,0.8530332326889039,0.8704863058196174,4.266666666666667,4.0,2.648346158215986,30.0,28.0,11.176273569893093,1.4272727272727272,1.0,0.7193316457163035,330,149,0.4515151515151515,1426,11,7.3.1,Absence from work,Chapter 7 - Misconduct
461,461,"There are jobs for which the need to report on time is more  critical than for others.  For example,  tardiness may mean a production line is delayed until the absent employee  arrives or can be replaced.  This results  in a loss of time and revenue.  There are  jobs in which the delay may be less critical, and the employer may be more  flexible in their expectations.  Fact  finding will establish the employer's expectations and the employee's  understanding regarding work schedules. Arriving continually late for work constitutes misconduct. The same applies  to prolonging coffee breaks and mealtimes beyond authorized lengths.  An employee must take the necessary steps to  be at the job at the agreed upon time, especially if the employee has previously  been warned about their lack of punctuality or issued verbal or written  warnings to the effect that if the behaviour did not improve, dismissal would result (A-558-12). In the event of a late arrival or a foreseen late arrival, an employee is  generally expected to inform the employer, explain the reasons, and request  permission.

462,462,"Neglecting to notify the employer of an absence in a timely manner may  constitute misconduct, even if the absence is caused by events beyond the  claimant's control. It is up to the claimant to prove that it was impossible to  inform the employer within a reasonable time. Preferably, the employee should notify the employer  about the absence. If it is not possible to do so, the spouse or some other  authorized or trusted person may do so for the employee. It is up to the  employee to use all reasonable means to notify the employer; it is not up to  the employer to inquire about the employee's reasons for being absent. When the statements of the employer and the employee are contradictory, it  is essential to obtain full details from both parties. The decision will be  based on the credibility of the statements and on the balance of probabilities. In certain situations, a failure to notify the employer of  an absence may not be considered misconduct.   Events may occur where it is reasonable to believe the employee had  satisfactory reasons for failing to report the absence.  Depending on the facts obtained relating to  the issues of notification and justification, an absence without permission may  or may not be misconduct.",54.55525000000003,11.21475,13.968273953766031,15.388571428571431,11.112187499999996,9.522321428571429,50.07857142857143,6.2,2.6385532974420274,0.2678518596423542,0.4853985823164884,0.0539678020421136,0.852621681160397,0.8358294889330864,4.53125,3.0,2.975931164298472,22.4,22.0,5.7306195127577615,1.53125,1.0,0.8706043928952871,224,99,0.4419642857142857,1020,10,7.3.1.2,Absence  without notification,Chapter 7 - Misconduct
463,463,"It is not enough to simply advise the employer of an absence; the employer  is entitled to know the reasons. Thus, in itself, an unjustified absence may  constitute misconduct. Absenting oneself for a frivolous reason, using some sort of excuse or pretense,  or refusing to disclose the reason for the absence, constitutes misconduct.  Misconduct is all the more evident if it is not a first offence. When permission to be absent was not granted by the employer and the  contention is that the claimant had to be absent regardless, the reason for the  absence becomes of prime importance (A-440-10). What needs to be determined in  such a case is whether the absence was necessary and unavoidable. Plausible  explanations are acceptable. In case of doubt, however, the claimant can be asked  to provide appropriate evidence. In such a case, it is not so much the failure  to provide proof that may result in a disqualification, but rather the fact  that the absence was without justification. In many cases, it is a question of credibility. An employee on sick leave  is not expected to remain totally idle during this period. Depending on the  nature of the incapacity, the time may be occupied with leisure pursuits or  domestic duties compatible with the state of health. However, the illness has  to be genuine and not a mere pretext for going about other business, and it  must remain credible given the type of activities pursued. Situations of harassment, abuse or violence, toward an employee may lead the  employee to be absent from work without expressly informing their employer of  the true reason for the absence. A dismissal in such circumstances, in which  the absence is related to the harassment and violence suffered by the claimant,  does not constitute misconduct within the meaning of the Act. The same may apply when a person is dismissed due to unsatisfactory  performance or behaviour detrimental to their employment - for example,  absenteeism or not getting along with others at work - if this performance or  behaviour stems from events related to harassment or violence suffered by the claimant  at the hands of a spouse or other individual.",55.210194389763785,11.474302821522311,13.624085052395262,15.19429133858268,12.369714566929131,10.288923884514432,51.89648950131233,6.6875,2.793500341075159,0.7083239793759207,0.4739399809913465,0.0648523401050811,0.8480119864145915,0.8504766012941088,4.648293963254593,4.0,2.9700479379095244,23.8125,23.5,13.153985850304082,1.5065616797900263,1.0,0.8468462348078322,381,177,0.4645669291338583,1788,16,7.3.1.3,Absence without justification,Chapter 7 - Misconduct
464,464,"Absenting oneself without requesting or receiving permission may constitute  misconduct, especially if the reason for the absence is not serious or if it  was not a first offence (A-198-11). Absenting oneself when the employer has refused authorization may be viewed  as misconduct, especially if the claimant has been formally warned by the  employer of the risk associated with defying orders. What is required in this  case is a determination of the actual circumstances and whether other  reasonable alternatives were available to the claimant. Neglecting to request permission should not be held against the claimant if  the absence was unavoidable, for example where it was due to illness, as long  as the employer was notified and the proof requested was provided. Permission means the employer acknowledges and allows the  absence.  Larger organizations usually  have a formal process by which leave is requested and granted.   Smaller employers may be less formal,  granting leave through verbal agreement.   If dismissal occurs because permission was not given, the Commission  must seek proof that permission was withheld by the employer, and that the  employee understood permission was denied.",45.546673994974896,13.086124371859295,15.903189008614271,17.990201005025124,14.841520100502514,12.764623115577889,59.54836683417086,8.625,2.876505539373186,0.5818207360915121,0.4564835932482991,0.0613791903749071,0.8698895914213998,0.879954069852829,5.060301507537688,4.0,3.110426930179791,24.875,27.5,9.713875385241463,1.6080402010050252,1.0,0.9117522355812444,199,109,0.5477386934673367,1007,8,7.3.1.4,Absence without permission,Chapter 7 - Misconduct
465,465,"Unauthorized, unjustified absence from work is a conduct  often subject to the progressive discipline process (A-416-08, A-440-10).  It is also one of the conditions that may be  cited by the employer as grounds for dismissal, even where no formal  progressive discipline process exists.   Employers may also be justified in terminating an employment because of  habitual lateness.  However, if the  employer has tolerated tardiness/absences with no evidence of a final warning,  the employee may not realize that a final incident of tardiness/absence is  considered an action for which the employer may enforce a disciplinary action (Digest 7.2.5.2).",40.486136363636376,14.444090909090914,15.579741850924794,17.90909090909091,15.399,11.935636363636366,62.95454545454545,9.75,3.436835342077278,0.7576744203665913,0.4403358738036157,0.0519954689532168,0.8561106125513712,0.8244381546974182,4.9,4.0,3.124536329237872,27.5,25.0,11.258330249197702,1.6363636363636365,1.0,0.8498906103651085,110,71,0.6454545454545455,545,4,7.3.1.5,Absence/Tardiness and progressive discipline,Chapter 7 - Misconduct

No misconduct exists if the  refusal or disobedience can be explained by a serious and genuine misunderstanding  not involving bad faith on the part of either party (A-440-83). The same can be said when it is apparent that a  personality conflict between the employee and the employer caused the dismissal  and the reason given by the employer was a mere pretext. An employee may find it  impossible, in all conscience, to follow a policy set out by the employer.

467,467,"When an employee refuses to  perform duties that are normally part of the job, it may be considered as  misconduct unless the refusal can be justified. If it is contended that the  employer's request contravenes provisions of a statute or the collective  agreement, the employee must, before refusing to perform the duties, take  appropriate steps to ensure the application of the statute or collective  agreement using, for example, grievance procedures. In other words, the  employee must try to avoid provoking dismissal by a refusal (A-200-09). Some legislation dealing  with occupational health and safety acknowledge the specific right of workers  to refuse to perform duties if they have reasonable grounds for believing that  there is some danger to their own or other persons' health or safety. This  right of refusal is generally granted to the worker until the designated  authorities have rendered a binding decision concerning the resumption of work.  However, a worker cannot refuse to perform certain duties when the immediate  effect of the refusal jeopardizes another person or when the conditions of work  are normal, given the type of occupation. When the refusal has to do  with additional duties that are not part of the employee's regular duties, the  decision rests on the legitimacy and reasonableness of the employer's request.  Another consideration would be whether the employee was offered monetary compensation  for these additional duties, or whether the employer's request was a special  request made in emergency or unforeseen circumstances. Unless there is a  significant difference between the duties requested and those normally  performed, the refusal constitutes misconduct on first consideration. It is  then up to the claimant to provide an explanation and justify the refusal. If the additional duties  entail a certain danger, the employee cannot be expected to blindly obey. The  claimant must provide a reasonable explanation to justify the refusal.  Therefore, when the additional duties present  a real danger, misconduct will not be concluded if the employee's refusal to  perform these additional duties was based on a real fear for their hreasons for the refusealth,  physical integrity or life, as opposed to stubbornness or lack of desire.",37.772269532034585,15.309921671018277,17.032423316055382,19.826390841534447,16.604816228158263,12.288250652741514,62.620807391042376,9.76923076923077,3.09789569767898,0.7795195693701682,0.4361085891581248,0.0537828445244556,0.8762882699569067,0.8752507242289457,4.947780678851175,4.0,3.067115063625268,29.46153846153846,28.0,11.725156286413776,1.6449086161879896,1.0,0.9417881605911586,383,164,0.4281984334203655,1910,13,7.3.2.1,Refusal to perform certain duties,Chapter 7 - Misconduct

The officer must try to  determine whether the order or instruction was reasonable and whether it  contravened any legal statutes or provisions of a collective agreement. It is  appropriate to question whether the claimant could have made use of channels  provided for under a collective agreement, for example, to voice disagreement  rather than risk dismissal by a flat refusal.

469,469,"Working overtime is a common and necessary practice in the  working world.  Business fluctuates and  it may not be prudent to increase staff to accommodate busier times.  Annual vacations and leave for medical reasons  can also create a need for overtime in the workplace.It is not, however, reasonable to require a person to work  an excessive amount of overtime, especially if this is an ongoing  practice.  It is also not reasonable for  the employer to expect employees to do this additional work without  compensation.  Different employees may be  capable of different amounts of overtime, and this should also be taken into  consideration.  An individual with health  problems or an older worker may not be able to work the same number of overtime  hours as a younger or healthier employee. In situations such as this a medical  from a physician stating the employee is unable to perform long periods of  overtime would be sufficient to determine a refusal to work overtime did not  constitute misconduct and to allow benefits.The employer should also try, if possible, to give some  notice when overtime is required, to allow employees with obligations outside  the workplace to make necessary arrangements in order to stay late or work  weekends.In principle an employee does not have the right to refuse  to comply with a reasonable request  by the employer unless the collective agreement or contract of employment  stipulates that the employee's consent is necessary in such circumstances.If the claimant alleges   the employer's request was in violation of the collective agreement in  that the required period of notice was not given, or alleges that it was  impossible to agree to the overtime in question, the claimant must demonstrate  the validity of the allegations against the employer and provide the reasons  for the refusal (CUB 72118).In the situation where a claimant chooses to quit rather  than wait to be dismissed for refusal, then the matter must be viewed in terms  of voluntarily leaving employment and adjudicated according to the provisions  in Chapter 6 of this Digest.",43.81620034121377,15.571810870095051,16.133371291317395,19.67623689982939,17.521381915671462,10.788096514745304,65.00828661954667,10.545454545454543,2.994506976037,0.5707910002576805,0.4762102064520171,0.0537153588893477,0.8599167883396148,0.8695362342728509,4.670241286863271,4.0,2.98451754593521,33.90909090909091,26.0,24.65195749356353,1.520107238605898,1.0,0.8237415386807555,373,166,0.4450402144772118,1734,11,7.3.2.3,Refusal to work overtime,Chapter 7 - Misconduct

471,471,"Respect, or lack thereof, can vary depending on the persons  involved.  One may find a particular  attitude offensive while another might see the behaviour as insulting and  another may not be bothered by it at all.   In making decisions in this area it is important to be aware of the  complexity of human relations, especially in view of our multi-cultural society.  Different cultures may view the same  behaviour in a different light.  It is  important to keep the facts in each case related to the opinions voiced by  those involved.Lack of respect may take many varied forms.  Insolence, impertinence, impoliteness,  coarseness, insults and threats can have different effects depending on the  attitude taken or the words spoken.  The  actions may offend, abuse, or provoke the employer, co-worker or client. As a general rule, attitudes, behaviours or remarks that  have the result of being offensive may be viewed as misconduct.  Before reaching such a conclusion however, one  must consider what circumstances led to the action and how those actions may be  viewed by the other person involved.  Did  the actions constitute a genuine offence incompatible with carrying out the  duties for which the person was hired?

472,472,"The cause of acts of violence that happen either at or  outside the workplace must be assessed before a decision of misconduct can be taken.  The act itself does not always lead to a  conclusion of misconduct.Details to consider when acts of violence lead to the  dismissal from employment would be:Was there physical injury?  If so, what led up to it?Were threatening remarks made?Was there aggressive, hostile or menacing  behaviour that created a reaction of violence?Was property intentionally damaged?Were weapons involved?Was the violence a form of retribution for acts  committed against the individual?As always, an officer will consider whether all reasonable  alternatives were exhausted. If this was an ongoing issue, did the claimant  speak to their supervisor/employer/union representative? The facts gathered  must provide the rationale behind the behaviour.  The facts should explain why the claimant  felt that violence was the only alternative.Acts of violence may constitute  a reaction to a disagreeable climate between individuals and are typified by acts of physical assault on another  person (A-33-13, A-184-13). Acts of violence may  constitute misconduct. A conclusion of misconduct must nonetheless be based on careful consideration.  For example, after asking for protection from  their employer, the claimant may have been provoked and forced to defend themselves. When the acts of  violence were committed outside of the workplace, their cause and subject must also  be assessed. Misconduct should be concluded where the infraction results in a  breach of a condition of employment and has led to the dismissal (A-1342-92).

473,473,"An employer has the right to establish the rules in an  employment relationship, as long as they comply with any legal requirements set  out by legislation (provincial and federal labour laws or immigration laws, for  example) and those set out in a collective agreement.An employer may find an employee's behaviour reprehensible  and consider that behaviour as misconduct.   The Commission examines the inherent value of the rule, its importance  in the workplace and how violating the rule adversely affected the  employer.  The Commission will determine  whether the behaviour for which the claimant was dismissed truly damaged the  employment relationship beyond repair.   This is decided based on an objective analysis of the facts. The Commission's decision on whether or not misconduct  occurred does not reflect on the employers' rights in managing their  business.   Although the employer may have  been justified in terminating the employment, the Commission may not bring a  finding of misconduct. The law only requires the Commission examine the  employee's conduct to determine whether the claimant understood the risk to the  job when the alleged misconduct occurred. A breach is described as a violation or infraction, a  failure to observe the terms,  a non-fulfilment  of a promise or contract, a breaking up of friendly relations, a disagreement,  a failure to carry out an obligation and other similar terms.Breaches of established work standards, instructions, rules  or regulations of the employer or the collective agreement may constitute  misconduct.  Some of the rules or  regulations may be contained in a written document; they may have been verbal  instructions or just  reasonable  expectations of the employer.  If a  breach has been made which led to the termination of the employment it is up to  the claimant to justify the conduct or to show that the requirement was  unreasonable.Failure to report a co-worker for misconduct in the  workplace can be considered a breach of rules/code of conduct, and could lead  to dismissal for misconduct (A-138-01).An offence committed outside  the workplace may constitute misconduct and lead to dismissal where the  infraction makes it such that the employee no longer meets the conditions of  employment.An error  attributable to intense pressure at work or inexperience does not amount to  misconduct unless it is wilful or the result of unwillingness. Unless there is clear negligence or dishonesty, it cannot be said that an error of judgment in decisions made or actions taken in the course of employment constitutes misconduct.",43.617477357089854,14.611839643652562,16.887214914478655,19.723890126206385,16.236978470675574,11.550378619153673,61.33645137342242,9.4,3.1634115278299717,0.8180776016220068,0.483527663393332,0.042768926401227,0.866576475756509,0.867320166184352,4.819599109131403,4.0,3.22033749142274,29.933333333333334,26.0,12.855435512740211,1.5701559020044544,1.0,0.8929819032213119,449,193,0.4298440979955457,2164,15,7.3.4,Breach of rules,Chapter 7 - Misconduct
474,474,"How a person dresses for work can depend in part on the type  of establishment and type of work a person does.  If the job requires a uniform, then the  obligation is to report to work dressed in the authorized manner.  If there is a guideline in place that the  uniform not be worn in public, then the employee should adhere to this practice  and change out of the uniform prior to after-work activities.Employers may have  requirements with respect to length of hair or of a beard, especially for  example, if the work is done in the presence of clients or if there is a  question of hygiene, safety or company image. Common sense dictates that an employee represents the employer  when at work.  If an employee is in  contact with clients, unacceptable clothes might include controversial logos,  phrases or pictures, soiled, worn out or torn garments, clothes that are too  revealing or outfits that are too dressy.   In general, clothes designed for sports, the beach or fancy parties may  not be suitable for the workplace.  If a  claimant has been dismissed for wearing such attire to work, to consider  misconduct an officer will obtain facts on whether the claimant knew the  clothes were unsuitable, or if they had been previously advised to stop wearing  similar outfits, etc.As a rule, a breach of the  employer's reasonable policies, rules or requirements concerning dress and  appearance may constitute misconduct unless they are shown to be in specific  contravention of moral principles or run counter to any legislation on human  rights and freedoms. A person who alleges that  such rules or requirements were unreasonable must be able to prove the  allegation, which may be difficult if these working conditions were known and  agreed to by the claimant at the time of hiring.

475,475,"Many sectors of the workforce have specific safety  rules.  These rules can be initiated by  the employer, provincial or federal safety laws.  They can be specific such as wearing safety  glasses or boots, prohibiting the use of certain dangerous products or  materials, or setting out guidelines for the transportation of certain types of  dangerous goods.These rules, aimed at  protecting human life and property, are even stricter in high-risk areas such  as air and marine navigation, railway operations, and operations in munitions  factories and nuclear plants. The fact that safety rules  were breached and that an accident resulted from such breach does not  necessarily mean there was misconduct. There is clear misconduct if the  person's breach of safety rules was deliberate, or occurred following a  warning, or where errors were made due to negligence or inattentiveness on the  claimant's part (CUB 53681, CUB 73893). There may be no  misconduct if the breach was negligible, not habitual and no real danger was  involved. Where a specific  responsibility demanding careful attention has been entrusted to an employee,  that person must ensure, and not simply assume, that it is properly carried out.   It may be that the breach was due to  lack of attention. It is up to the claimant to provide explanations for the  negligence or lack of attention shown. In certain sectors, such as  in railway operations, an entire crew may be held responsible for a breach of  safety rules or for incidents that endangered the lives of people or caused  material damage, even though some members of the team may share little or none  of the blame. For EI purposes there is misconduct only if the claimant was  personally guilty of the breach or for the incidents. In high risk sectors (air traffic, nuclear plants etc.) a  board is often appointed to inquire into the circumstances surrounding the  violation of a safety regulation.  The  finding of the board does not affect the decision of the Commission.  It is necessary to carefully analyze all  relevant information to determine whether the actions or omissions attributed  to the claimant constitute misconduct within the meaning of the EI legislation.Finally, there may be no  misconduct if a person concerned with safety rules refuses to drive a vehicle  or use a piece of machinery because of a real or perceived serious threat to  health or safety. If there was a serious motive for the refusal, as opposed to  capriciousness or simple conflict with the employer and in the circumstances there  were no other reasonable alternatives, then there may not be a conclusion of  misconduct.",56.31222222222226,11.89163120567376,14.554592549557764,16.57210401891253,13.411810874704493,10.264510638297873,52.28132387706856,6.833333333333333,3.01635418543741,0.7048204018589793,0.4648529552952624,0.069997167712734,0.8292113419841317,0.8235314749181271,4.625531914893617,4.0,2.9758222954484066,26.11111111111111,22.5,12.027232474166878,1.4659574468085106,1.0,0.861660098791165,470,206,0.4382978723404255,2181,18,7.3.4.2,Safety rules,Chapter 7 - Misconduct
476,476,"Situations may occur where the claimant and/or the employer  will indicate that the incident that resulted in dismissal was brought about by  the claimant's problem with, or addiction to alcohol, drugs or gambling. While  such addiction is recognized as an illness, jurisprudence has held that it does  not exempt the claimant from their obligations with regard to their employment,  nor does it excuse the actions which violated the contract of employment. Ultimately, only expert evidence which  clearly and unequivocally establishes that the claimant themselves could not  form any intent may be accepted as an excuse.   This evidence would have to be very strong and show that the problem/addiction  (i.e. alcohol) prevented the claimant from having any wilful thought.  This evidence will probably only occur in rare  instances.The employer may have no alternative but to dismiss the  employee.    If the claimant lost their job  because they failed to show up for work as a result of an addiction, there is  no doubt that they lost the job due to their own misconduct (A-255-03).An assertion of having an addiction does not in itself  negate wilfulness and cannot be successfully used as justification to exonerate  the claimant from misconduct.  It is the  consequence of this behaviour and how it affected the employment contract that  must be assessed and weighed to ascertain if misconduct was present.Numerous incidents can develop in the context of excessive  consumption of alcohol or flow from problems caused by addiction which affect a  person's relationships at work (A-85-06).   The particular offence (i.e. absence from work, insubordination, hostile  behaviour, breach of rules) must be dealt with in the same way as with any  other claimant.Workers have rights under the law, but they also have  obligations.  Guidance found in the  pertinent sections of this chapter, such as absence from work (A-315-05),  insubordination, hostile behaviour and breach of rules should be applied.7.3.4.3.1  Alcohol It can generally be said that every contract of employment  includes an implied prohibition against the consumption of alcohol during  working hours, except under special working conditions, as in the case of wine  tasting, for example, or in special circumstances such as representing one's  firm at a business meal where alcohol is served.As a general rule, misconduct may exist whenever this  prohibition is violated, regardless of whether or not the business had a formal  regulation in this respect.  This is particularly  relevant if the nature of the employment is such that any consumption of  alcohol is banned or not appropriate, such as for someone who drives a public  vehicle or is a police officer or truck driver.The use of alcohol may not take place on the worksite but  still may affect the ability to carry out work duties.  The situation where a person presents  themselves at work in an inebriated state and cannot adequately carry out their  duties could constitute misconduct.Alcoholism cannot excuse a claimant for actions amounting to  misconduct and leading to dismissal.  It  is irrelevant whether alcoholism is a addiction or whether the employer  should have accommodated the claimant (A-213-09).For example, where a claimant was dismissed for absenteeism,  it was decided that without evidence of the absence of wilfulness, the repeated  failure to report to work as a result of alcohol consumption is voluntary  behaviour done consciously and with the knowledge of the effects and consequences  this consumption could have on the employment. 7.3.4.3.2  DrugsMore and more companies are introducing drug testing  policies for reasons of safety to their employees, customers or the general  public. These policies often require that employees who test positive for the  use of illegal drugs be terminated. The level of drugs found in the employee's  system is often not a factor because many companies have a zero tolerance  policy. These tests are usually administered as a condition of employment,  during the probationary period or at random during the employment.  The fact that the drug use may have occurred  prior to the start date of employment is irrelevant.  Loss of any employment as a result of the  misconduct, which is not limited to the employment occupied at the time of  misconduct, is still misconduct under the Act (A-239-06, A-875-96).  The fact that some people use substances such as illicit  drugs, or that some people misuse prescription drugs is not new. Awareness that  the abuse of substances may affect the workplace just as the workplace may  affect substance abuse is, however, growing. Many aspects of the workplace  today require alertness as well as accurate and quick reflexes. Employers may  dismiss an employee due to the fact that drugs impede these qualities, which  may cause serious accidents and interfere with the accuracy and efficiency of  work. It is not the act of taking drugs that is the cause for the dismissal,  but the effects of taking drugs on the ability to fulfill the conditions of  employment, that are the reason for the dismissal and the finding of misconduct.It is important to conduct in-depth fact-finding and present  relevant documentation in decisions of misconduct to ensure the burden of proof  that the claimant lost their employment due to their misconduct, is met (A-135-01, A-72-02).7.3.4.3.3  GamblingThe effects of a gambling problem may spill over into the  workplace, primarily through lost time, lost productivity, and in  desperate situations, the gambler may resort to theft.Individuals with gambling problems can become completely  pre-occupied with gambling. The workday can be spent  in the act of gambling, planning the next  gambling opportunity, or plotting to get money for gambling.  Any of these activities may breach the  employment contract.As a result of the lost time, a company's productivity is  often damaged. The gambler becomes unreliable, misses project deadlines and  important meetings and produces inferior quality work.  Employees with severe problems may commit  theft, fraud or embezzlement (CUB 54535).  If a claimant has been dismissed due to a  gambling problem, the employer most likely has background and facts to support  their decision.  Again, it is not the  gambling alone that causes the dismissal, many people gamble and their work is  not affected.  It is the result of the  gambling addiction on the workplace which leads to the dismissal that must be considered  when reaching a decision of misconduct.The Commission, as in all cases of misconduct, must look at  the claimant's explanations for their actions.   If the claimant had been leaving work early to gamble, then the issue  would be addressed similarly to other persons in the workforce who are absent  from work without permission.Some of the issues associated with unreliability and  inaptitude can be found in the section on dereliction of duties.In each case the facts must support the conclusion that  misconduct was involved and the claimant would have had to be aware of the  effects this would have on their job (A-381-85, A-1342-92).Gambling, like any other addiction, should not be used as an  excuse to avoid a finding of misconduct.   There is a strong possibility that a person who loses their employment  as a result of behaviour associated with an addiction may not be entitled to EI  regular benefits (A-255-03).",52.18207083304264,13.337829309983956,14.45679766184558,17.156275727342496,15.592980883276354,10.93528779739064,57.47242377729715,8.25,3.076762515257509,0.6648594266250011,0.4767667521406664,0.0616112209775372,0.8621930812680444,0.8525875480402083,4.7168073676132005,4.0,2.9483272985348323,29.613636363636363,25.5,17.484039356836423,1.4727551803530314,1.0,0.8146692349166451,1303,438,0.3361473522640061,6175,44,7.3.4.3,Impairment and addictions,Chapter 7 - Misconduct
477,477,"An employment contract can be broadly defined as an  agreement between employer and employee assigning payment and benefits to the  employee in exchange for services.  This  implies respect for rules of conduct agreed to by the parties and sanctioned by  professional ethics, common sense, usage or custom.There are numerous acts and omissions that can be labelled  misconduct, in the sense that they are incompatible with the objectives of an  employment contract, present a conflict of interest with the employer's activities, or have a negative effect  on the relationship of trust between the parties. This would also be the case  where it is a violation of a law, a regulation, or of a professional code of  ethics that results in a breach of a condition of employment leading to the  dismissal. This applies, for example,  to sleeping on the job, making long-distance telephone calls at the employer's  expense, taking supplies for one's own personal use without authorization,  falsifying expense accounts or time sheets, selling articles belonging to the  employer without authorization, or taking money from the employer's till  without authorization, even if intending to later replace it (CUB 76342). Incompetence, unsatisfactory performance, inaptitude to  perform certain duties, or an error attributable to intense pressure at work or  inexperience does not amount to misconduct unless it is wilful or the result of  unwillingness to abide by the employer's rules or procedures (A-337-07, A-64-06). The fact that other employees could be guilty of the same misconduct and not be dismissed is irrelevant.In addition, unless there is  clear negligence or dishonesty, an error in judgment in decisions made or actions taken in the course of  employment may not amount to misconduct.Depending on the nature of the dishonesty, a false statement  made at the time of applying for work cannot generally support the conclusion  that the loss of employment was due to misconduct.  The Commission will examine whether the  claimant would have had reason to believe that such a false statement would  cost them their employment, if discovered.   A simple misrepresentation as to where they lived at the time of  application, would not affect performance at work, whereas a false statement  that they had the required university degree or a clean driving record would  constitute misconduct if the claimant knew these conditions were required for  the position.  The same false statement  about a clean driving record may not constitute misconduct if the claimant was  applying for a cashier position and had no expectation that the driving record  would affect their ability to do that job and wanted to appear more responsible  to the employer.",36.96463276836161,17.875000000000004,17.219254097808864,21.91977401129944,20.8486581920904,11.676440677966102,68.99435028248587,11.666666666666666,3.405595407506949,0.9185829497478076,0.4846900735145256,0.0636088843189172,0.8849703127687628,0.88012535572052,4.800847457627119,4.0,3.09293880771286,39.333333333333336,38.0,13.46806923389128,1.5360169491525424,1.0,0.9059451846987366,472,212,0.4491525423728814,2283,12,7.3.4.4,Dereliction of duty,Chapter 7 - Misconduct
478,478,"An employer has a certain expectation that  employees will conduct themselves in an  ethical manner within the workplace.   Employees are expected to use good judgment in the use of company  resources.  Any personal use of company  resources should not incur significant added costs, disruption of business  processes, loss of work performance or any other disadvantage to the employer.  Use of company resources for non-company purposes is appropriate only when  specifically authorized by the employer. Employees can unknowingly compromise the security and  integrity of the employer through the improper use of company equipment.  To conclude misconduct, the claimant would  have had to be aware that they were misusing the equipment or resources but  chose to do it anyway. Misuse of company resources can have many different forms.  It may be by making unauthorized long  distance telephone calls (CUB 40938, CUB  27984), using company equipment for personal use  or submitting inaccurate expense accounts (CUB 68295, CUB 75036).  Taking gifts from customers or suppliers in  return for using their services or purchasing their equipment or products is  also a misuse of company resources. 7.3.4.5.1  Computer, internet and emailEmployees at work should be using the office equipment for  the sole purpose of conducting company business.  The use should not interfere with the  performance of business, the employee's assigned duties, and should not  adversely affect the performance of the employee.E-mail in the workplace is not intended to be used for  external broadcast messages or to send or post chain letters, messages of a  political or religious nature, or messages that contain obscene, profane, or  otherwise offensive language or material (CUB 75946, CUB 71685).  Employees may use E-mail to send messages with  union-related content only with approval of management. Equipment, such as computers and copiers, are provided for  the conduct of company business. The company may incur costs based on the rate  of use of such equipment.  Personal use  of a company system or network for any purpose except in accordance with  company policy and procedure can be grounds for dismissal for misconduct (CUB 70558).  If the employee requires the use of the  computer to conduct personal business, permission should be sought from the  employer before doing so.  In addition,  such use should not be on work time.7.3.4.5.2  Credit cardsMany employers issue credit cards to their employees for  conducting day to day business. Loss of employment for inappropriate use of company credit cards could  constitute misconduct.  Some examples of  misuse might include using the credit card to cover private expenses; private telephone accounts including  internet/broadband services; purchasing gasoline for personal vehicles;  personal professional association membership fees; travel costs when the  claimant is to receive a per diem or specified travel advance; withdrawal of  cash /cash advances for personal expenditures Common sense  dictates the charges for which the credit card can legitimately be used.  Many companies will have a written policy,  but smaller employers may have a verbal discussion regarding the uses for which  the credit card is approved.  An innocent  charge for a small amount, (ex. dry cleaning charges required for clothing  while travelling,) would not necessarily be considered by the claimant as an  action which could cause the termination of their employment, although it is  definitely a personal expense.  All  details of the incident causing the dismissal must be obtained before a  determination of misconduct can be made.",49.89352150537636,12.717903225806452,14.434950587195996,16.397849462365592,14.6340376344086,11.951548387096771,59.05913978494624,8.583333333333334,2.925376944371284,0.7528825712694622,0.4751152968146567,0.0591066902547084,0.8506512253180795,0.8293028202923861,4.914516129032258,4.0,3.024221935350642,25.83333333333333,25.0,10.96078869830492,1.5451612903225806,1.0,0.8129352272246857,620,259,0.4177419354838709,3053,24,7.3.4.5,Misuse of company resources,Chapter 7 - Misconduct
479,479,"Jurisprudence has held that when a criminal offence  constitutes the event that brought about the severance from employment, the  fact that charges have or will be laid is not sufficient to prove that  misconduct exists (A-130-96, A-1342-92, A-517-91, A-42-13). Fact-finding in cases of criminal offences may be particularly challenging  when adjudicating a claim for benefit.The Commission does not have to await the result of a police  investigation or decision of the criminal court before making a decision, nor  is the Commission bound by the findings of either. The fact that charges have  been brought, or that a verdict has not yet been rendered or that there was an  acquittal, is not determinative on the question of misconduct. It is not  unusual in this type of case to have a lengthy delay between the laying of  charges and the hearing. The decision as to entitlement to benefit will not be  delayed in such circumstances unless the case is expected to be heard very  soon. The Commission's decision is  based on the information gathered from both the claimant and the employer.  There will be a reasonable search for the pertinent facts. This is not an  intensive investigation to demonstrate beyond any doubt that the person was or  was not guilty of the infraction, nor is there an exhaustive interrogation.  These roles belong to the Crown and other tribunals of competent jurisdiction,  and not to the Commission. Both the claimant and the employer must be:asked for their account of the incident that gave  rise to the claimant's dismissal able to describe from their own perspective, the  circumstances surrounding the incident that led to the dismissal, and clarify  any contradictions made aware of the fact that the Commission's  decision to pay benefits or not, will be made on the basis of the information  provided The employer may be  reluctant to divulge certain relevant information, or may possess little  information when the offence occurred outside the workplace. This information relating  mainly to the actions or omissions of  the claimant is nonetheless essential for arriving at a decision. It is no more  permissible in this type of offence than for other types to rely on vague  statements, presumptions or an assumption that the employer must surely have  had good reasons for dismissing the claimant. When faced with insufficient or ambiguous information the decision will  rely on the balance of probabilities, on what seems most likely, based on all  of the credible information obtained.The Commission's decision may be revisited once the courts have  rendered judgement, if the claimant or employer request that the decision be  reconsidered.  When the Commission has  ruled no misconduct it is the Court's reasons for the guilty decision or plea  that will be considered. These reasons may bring to light new facts never  presented to the Commission and may result in a review of the decision.  However, if all the facts were before the Commission and the officer originally  concluded no misconduct, that decision cannot simply be changed because the  claimant was found guilty, based on those same facts. Likewise, if the decision  was misconduct and the claimant is acquitted rather than found guilty, the  decision may be reconsidered but there is no obligation to do so. Withdrawal of a charge in criminal proceedings often simply means the  Crown lacks sufficient evidence to incriminate the claimant beyond any  reasonable doubt. Misconduct within the meaning of the EI Act is determined on the basis of the balance of probabilities, which  is much less stringent. The offence which constitutes an infraction or a criminal act which results in a conviction under  the Criminal Code would be misconduct  resulting in a disqualification when it led to a dismissal because the employee  could no longer meet the conditions of employment. Claimants who are jailed or imposed a conditional sentence of house arrest (CUB 66756) and subsequently dismissed  by the employer as they are not able to provide services, are considered to  have lost their employment by reason of their own misconduct (A-1342-92).  Having a record of convictions can be a serious obstacle for  individuals seeking employment. As a result, it is fairly common for someone  not to reveal the existence of a conviction record when hired.  If the employer later learns about this  record and decides to dismiss the worker solely for this reason, once reviewed,  the separation may  not be considered to  be misconduct for EI purposes.",51.55948076923079,13.711750000000002,15.143640949648024,18.057692307692307,16.026852884615387,10.793149999999995,57.51923076923077,8.23076923076923,3.161734301820009,0.8710627632376629,0.4724417424817104,0.0645752761546247,0.8724106812477112,0.8676411236325899,4.68625,4.0,3.0410213641965758,30.76923076923077,26.0,16.02715890247573,1.46625,1.0,0.8581147577684467,800,297,0.37125,3766,26,7.3.4.6,Criminal charges and offences,Chapter 7 - Misconduct
480,480,"When incarceration is involved and the officer is not  sure whether it should be addressed as misconduct, voluntary leaving, or a  leave of absence the issues to keep in mind are as follows.If an employer takes the initiative to terminate an  employee's contract when wrongful conduct results in the employee being  incarcerated and thus unable to show up for work, the resulting loss of  employment is attributable to misconduct. The claimant is fully responsible for  the breach of the employment as it is because of their own actions that they  can no longer report to work (A-338-03). If the claimant ceases to show up for work because of  incarceration and the employer takes no initiative, the loss of employment that  eventually results is attributable to voluntary leaving without just  cause.  Imprisonment results from  deliberate actions by the claimant, which in turn results in the fact that the  claimant is no longer able to appear for work.   This does not constitute justification for the loss of employment. When the claimant ceases to show up for work because of  incarceration and makes arrangements with the employer for a leave of absence  during the incarceration, the issue should be dealt with like any leave of  absence with the appropriate disentitlement being imposed.",45.39078947368421,15.019874686716792,15.532846611407376,18.81804511278196,16.95966165413534,10.885964912280702,59.764411027568926,8.857142857142858,3.1294029258095697,0.7141320660064221,0.5159393716365666,0.0279228812949318,0.9091763496398926,0.932627511024475,4.692982456140351,4.0,3.098180544110162,32.57142857142857,35.0,10.594569267279518,1.5175438596491229,1.0,0.9709143469580428,228,100,0.4385964912280701,1070,7,7.3.5,Incarceration,Chapter 7 - Misconduct
481,481,"In cases where an employee whose job involves driving has  their licence suspended due to charges of impaired driving under the Criminal  Code of Canada, they are no longer able to fulfil the requirements of their  job.  If the employer is not able or not  willing to assign other work to them, the employer would have no choice but to  dismiss them. This would constitute misconduct as the claimant knew that they required a licence to do their work.  In  such a case, it would be considered that:the decision to drive while intoxicated was  deliberatethe decision to drive, knowing that one could be  in violation of the provisions of the law was deliberate or so reckless as to  approach wilfulnessthe misconduct led to the loss of the driver's  licenceby losing the driver's licence the employee  breached an express obligation of their work contractthis breach resulted in the loss of employmentthere is a causal relationship between the  misconduct and the dismissalIt is the act (driving while impaired, reckless driving)  that constitutes misconduct and not a conviction of a driving offence.The Commission can meet the burden of proof by providing  proper evidence.  It is not enough to  show that the driver's licence was suspended.   This must be supported by the appropriate provisions of provincial or  territorial legislation.Evidence collected should show that (A-444-02)the claimant committed acts that constitute an  offence under a provincial or territorial statuethe requirements of the suspension of the  drivers licence were met, thus the acts committed constitute misconductthe claimant lost their licence because of the  misconduct (driving while under the influence of alcohol etc.)the claimant can no longer meet an essential  requirement of their employment as they do not hold a valid driver's licencethese facts led to the loss of employmentA copy of the relevant provisions of the highway safety code  dealing with the suspension of the driver's licence must be attached to the  file, along with a copy of the notice of suspension or the record of  proceedings.  The claimant is able to  provide such information because provincial legislation requires the police to  provide the driver with a document at the time the licence is suspended.  Should the claimant refuse to provide the  information requested because they feel that it could be detrimental to them, a  disentitlement can be imposed for failure to provide information requested by  the Commission.If a person loses a driver's licence for impaired driving,  the loss of the licence arises from the offence committed (A-444-02, A-126-03). If a person loses a driver's licence for neglecting to pay  traffic fines, the loss of the driver's licence does not arise from the offence  that resulted in the fine, but rather from non-compliance.  Failure to pay traffic fines and particularly  the accumulation of unpaid traffic tickets or failure to comply with a court  order reveals deliberate, reckless or negligent behaviour on the part of the  claimant.  The loss of employment is due  to the fact that the employee is no longer in a position to fulfill the  conditions of the employment contract (A-720-01, A-72-04). If a person loses a driver's licence for neglecting to pay  child support, the loss of licence does not arise from an offence, but rather  from non-compliance with a court order (A-666-02, A-78-04). If the loss of licence is due to non-compliance with a court  order it is possible for a person to prove justification by showing that they  used every avenue available to them for assistance, that they were neither  negligent nor reckless with regard to their obligations and were not defiant  toward judicial authorities.  All factors  must be considered before determining if misconduct exists.There may be situations where an employer decides to suspend  an employee due to loss of their driver's licence, allowing them time to  enquire about re-acquiring the licence.   At the time of the suspension, depending on the facts on file, a finding  of suspension for misconduct may be made.   If so, a disentitlement is imposed.If the employee, upon their return to work after re-acquiring  their licence, is dismissed by their employer due to the loss of their driver's  licence, a finding of misconduct cannot be made (A-90-07).  As indicated earlier, the Commission cannot  make a finding of misconduct if an employer initially imposes a milder  punishment and later decides to dismiss the employee for the same infraction.The Commission will need to collect information from the  claimant concerning the reasons they failed to comply with the court order and  what alternatives were available to them.   Was there any assistance available to individuals who are unable to pay  a fine or fulfill a commitment due to financial difficulties?  If the claimant raises financial difficulties  as justification for their non-compliance, the fact finding should not just  focus on the claimant's financial situation, but also on what measures or  arrangements the claimant made, or could have made, to obtain more time to make  the payment, thereby preventing the loss of the driver's licence.  Should it have been possible for them to make  arrangements, then their financial situation alone cannot be used to make a  finding that misconduct was proven (A-72-04).",45.24361282592805,15.997259767687437,16.09822454788146,20.22920964990659,18.69025018276338,10.738331573389647,63.87819835919096,10.0,3.069957655190332,0.6857704416614708,0.4832416010070944,0.0603866419520553,0.8405146288871765,0.831287128229936,4.651531151003168,4.0,2.98518080084948,36.42307692307692,31.5,26.514398232082648,1.4730728616684263,1.0,0.8373938539946856,947,294,0.3104540654699049,4441,26,7.3.6,Loss of driver's licence,Chapter 7 - Misconduct
482,482,"The various  labour laws provide everyone with the right to belong to a labour association,  organization or union of their choice and to participate in its formation,  lawful activities and administration. The loss of employment resulting from the  exercise of this right will not be held to be misconduct. Lawful activities generally correspond to the activities  allowed under the various provincial or federal laws dealing with labour  relations or an agreement between employer and union within the framework of a  collective agreement or some sort of labour contract.Union representatives have the same obligation as all other  employees; to accept the direction of the employer with respect to the  performance of the job (A-683-86).It is not unusual for a claimant to allege that a dismissal  resulted from union affiliation or activities, especially at times when a first  union local is being formed or there is a labour conflict.  If no unlawful activity was involved, the  probability is that other grounds for dismissal may have been cited the  employer (CUB 76348).These potentially conflicting positions regarding the  reasons for dismissal make it challenging to search for facts and determine the  credibility of statements made.  There  must be a clear causal connection between the misconduct and the  dismissal.  If misconduct is used as a  simple excuse or pretext for dismissal that is actually for another reason, no disqualification  will be imposed.  The misconduct must be  the cause for losing the employment, to result in a disqualification.Finally, participation in an illegal strike does constitute  misconduct by the claimant involved, even if such misconduct involved several  employees.  The misconduct of which an  individual is guilty is still their misconduct for the purposes of the  legislation.",37.35145819935696,15.775655948553055,17.122413403193683,20.15704180064309,17.33681672025724,12.232282958199356,61.00353697749196,9.3,2.990583711906518,0.5508137648794342,0.5025701703362058,0.0382930206518571,0.8844733834266663,0.8945652842521667,4.929260450160772,4.0,3.296906730077163,31.1,24.5,15.757220567092409,1.630225080385852,1.0,0.9894554744070078,311,149,0.4790996784565916,1526,10,7.3.7,Unlawful union activity,Chapter 7 - Misconduct
483,483,An indefinite disentitlement is imposed when a claimant is suspended from employment due to their own misconduct.  The disentitlement begins with the week in which the suspension occurred if the claimant has an ongoing claim or the benefit period commencement on a new claim.  The disentitlement continues for the length of the claim unless the claimant meets one of the conditions listed below.,48.18179487179489,11.921538461538464,15.021129683784007,16.666666666666668,13.315641025641028,12.686153846153845,49.358974358974365,6.0,2.508741681790684,0.1042143847738863,0.5584694494857834,0.0721384725159888,0.8725697100162506,0.7501518130302429,5.076923076923077,4.0,3.357231883138214,21.666666666666668,19.0,4.496912521077347,1.6153846153846154,1.0,1.0769230769230769,65,45,0.6923076923076923,331,3,7.4.0,Periods of suspension from employment,Chapter 7 - Misconduct
484,484,"For EI purposes, claimants under suspension are considered  unemployed, although on a temporary basis.   Because the employee's actions triggered this period of unemployment,  the reasons for the suspension are subject to the same considerations as having  the employment terminated by the employer.   Since the suspension is a temporary situation, a finding of misconduct  results in a disentitlement rather than a disqualification.  The disentitlement applies to each day of the  suspension.The suspension may be for a few days or interspersed with  employment.  With a finding of  misconduct, the claimant will be disentitled for any days that constitute a  suspension.The suspension from the employment may be with or without  pay.  The terms of the suspension must require that the person return to  work on a date agreed to by the claimant and the employer, in order to  determine the period of any potential disentitlement.Just because the employer suspended the claimant, it does  not mean the reason for this was misconduct within the meaning of the EI Act.  The Commission will determine,  based on the information gathered, whether the suspension was as a result of  the claimant's own misconduct.  Current  adjudication principles concerning such a finding continue to apply in these  cases.When it is shown that a person has been suspended by reason of misconduct, a disentitlement will be imposed and the person will not be entitled to receive benefits until they meet one of three provisions outlined in section 31 of the EI Act.(a) The period of suspension expiresWhether or not the person returns to work following the  suspension is not an issue with respect to the termination of the  disentitlement.  It will suffice that the  suspension is over.  However, if the  claimant does not recommence employment, the officer must consider the issue  of voluntary leaving and just cause pursuant to sections 29 and 30 of the EI Act.(b) The claimant loses or  voluntarily leaves the employmentUnlike indefinite  disqualifications, to lose employment in these situations does not necessarily  mean that the person was dismissed.  The  condition to terminate the disentitlement will be met if the person is dismissed or  quits the employment.  Of course, should  the person quit without just cause or be dismissed for misconduct, these issues  must be addressed in order to assess their entitlement to benefits.In situations of lay-offs  during a suspension where there is a complete and final severance of the  employer-employee relationship that leaves a claimant with no possibility to  resume work, a suspension ends as of the date the employment permanently  ends.  It must be noted that the date the  employment ends is the day on which the employer/employee relationship is permanently  severed.  It is not the last day worked  prior to the suspension.  As long as  the claimant meets all other entitlement conditions, benefits may be payable as  of the end of the disentitlement.(c) The claimant, after the beginning of the period of  suspension, accumulates with another employer the number of hours of insurable  employment required by section 7 or 7.1 to qualify to receive benefitsUnlike indefinite disqualifications, the claimant is only  required to meet the requalifying conditions; a new claim need not be  established.  If the claim is a renewal,  the disentitlement is terminated at the point the Variable Entrance Requirement  (VER) is met.  If it is an initial claim,  and the VER has been met, the disentitlement is not imposed.If the conditions for ending the disentitlement have not  been met when the claim ends the disentitlement will be carried over to the  next benefit period.If the claimant decides to voluntarily quit the employment  while on suspension, the disentitlement will be terminated on the date prior to  the date the claimant decided to voluntarily leave.  The officer must then adjudicate the reason  for voluntarily leaving pursuant to sections 29 and 30 of the EI Act.Officers will impose the disentitlement for each day of  suspension.  However, if the suspension  is to end on a future date, the officer will impose an indefinite  disentitlement for control purposes; to ensure all entitlement conditions are  being met at that time.",49.15119186560568,12.647543766578249,14.975302809339372,16.89683465959328,13.31239610963749,10.706631299734743,52.45428824049514,6.866666666666666,2.717287151478004,0.532356479729509,0.4849342544479596,0.0657843642170652,0.8567630730826279,0.843227248106684,4.708222811671088,3.0,3.370532512014376,25.133333333333333,23.5,10.944506486005762,1.5623342175066313,1.0,1.0063263360683283,754,239,0.3169761273209549,3544,30,7.4.1,Relief from disentitlement,Chapter 7 - Misconduct
485,485,"Employment Insurance (EI) benefits are paid from public funds comprised  of premiums paid by employers and claimants, the two parties traditionally  involved in labour disputes, and whose interests clearly differ. The  legislative provisions relating to labour disputes provide for neutrality in  the administration of these funds (FCA  A-879-82, CUB79649; FCA A-521-86, CUB  12543).Pursuant to EI  Act 36(1), if a claimant loses an employment, or is unable to resume an  employment, because of a work stoppage attributable to a labour dispute at their  place of employment the claimant is not entitled to receive benefits until the  earlier ofthe end of the work stoppage, andthe day on which the claimant becomes regularly engaged elsewhere in insurable employment.EI  Regulation 52 provides that the number of days of  disentitlement in a week may be less than five for a claimant who loses or is  unable to resume part-time employment because of the reason mentioned above. The intention of this provision is to  disentitle a claimant only to the extent of the part-time employment that they  lost or cannot resume because of a labour dispute.Furthermore, under certain conditions, the disentitlement may be  suspended when the claimant proves that they are otherwise entitled to certain types  of benefits (EI Act 36(3)).The disentitling provisions will not apply if  the claimant proves they are not participating in, financing, or directly interested in the labour dispute that caused the stoppage of work (EI  Act 36(4)).",25.780297709923676,22.6811145038168,18.66944999605865,26.608854961832066,27.493053435114504,12.002748091603053,81.78931297709923,15.4,3.74031067612463,0.7339161732439574,0.4683545208822323,0.0283482996320121,0.9163770228624344,0.8891587257385254,4.824427480916031,4.0,3.152560854194169,52.4,41.0,23.71160053644629,1.5114503816793894,1.0,0.8637430722537035,262,128,0.4885496183206106,1275,5,8.1.0,Authority,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
486,486,"The EI account from which benefits are paid, consists of amounts  deducted as premiums from the income of employees (EI  Act 67) and from premiums paid by employers (EI  Act 68). In labour disputes, the interests of these two groups of contributors usually  differ. To prevent the act from  having any influence whatsoever on labour-management relations, Parliament has  imposed strict rules that prohibit the use of EI funds from being used to  support either party in a labour dispute (FCA  A-521-86, CUB 12543; and FCA  A-226-88, CUB 14715).Moreover, the EI program was never intended to insure the loss of  employment due to participation in such disputes, regardless of which party is  right or wrong (CUB  76451). The issue is not one of equity; the determination of entitlement in  these circumstances is not based on fault or merit. The Commission must  demonstrate an ongoing impartiality at every step of the decision making  process, as well as avoid any judgment or interference in the dispute.Even though a refusal of benefits to claimants may appear to provide  assistance to an employer in resolving a dispute in their favour, this approach  does not contravene Parliament's concern for neutrality (FCA  A-521-86, CUB 12543; FCA  A-1036-92, CUB  21237; FCA  A-226-88, CUB  14715).It should rather be viewed in the context that  the payment of benefits to employees involved in a strike could tip the balance  in the negotiations that have reached an impasse (CUB  21842; CUB  16202).",38.55579670329672,19.18503663003663,16.32212239822248,22.88864468864469,22.333846153846157,9.783296703296704,69.30952380952381,10.833333333333334,3.5355432242990656,0.4239275187890368,0.490391355140187,0.0595733790987231,0.8637148022651673,0.8593345880508423,4.461538461538462,3.0,2.931355156643684,45.5,31.0,30.41792234851026,1.4432234432234432,1.0,0.806043935236164,273,148,0.5421245421245421,1233,6,8.1.1,Purpose,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
487,487,"The act's provisions  relating to labour disputes are not discriminatory and in no way contravene the  principles set forth in the Canadian  Human Rights Act(FCA  A-226-88, CUB  14715). They apply equally to all claimants without exception,  including those employed in job creation partnerships (EI  Act 25), or under work sharing agreements (EI Act  24). Special rules apply, however, to reflect the specific characteristics  of the fishing industry (Digest chapter 15).  With respect to entitlement, the  provisions of labour disputes apply to workers employed in the fishing industry,  but there exist differences in its application (EI  Act 36; EI  fishing Regulations). All provisions dealing with  entitlement to benefits (EI Act  6(1)) coexist in such a way that, an  individual may meet the requirements under a specific section of the act, but may not receive benefits  if the requirements under another section are not met for the same period.A  person who has been disentitled under the labour dispute provisions may be  otherwise entitled to special benefits or to benefits while attending a course  or employment activity, as directed by a designated authority. The conditions  that permit the suspension of the disentitlement, however, must be met (EI  Act 36(3)). Special benefits include maternity, parental,  sickness, compassionate care or family caregiver benefits.The  protection provided in the act with  respect to the right of union association does not apply when the loss of  employment results from a stoppage of work attributable to a labour dispute (EI  Act 35). The labour dispute provisions do not affect the right of employees  to strike. As well, the fact that a disentitlement continues after settlement  of the dispute, does not go against the freedom of association provided in the Canadian Bill of Rights and in the Canadian Charter of Rights and  Freedoms (the Charter) (FCA  A-226-88, CUB  14715; Supreme  Court decision 1909488, CUB 8764). The right of a union to strike is not protected by the freedom of  association of its members and the consequence of exercising this right does  not infringe this freedom. The same can be said for the consequences of an  employer exercising the legal right to resort to a lock-out.The rule outlined in the labour dispute  provisions is neither fundamentally unjust nor unreasonable and does not  contravene the Charter.  Moreover, the particular scheme set up in the act contemplates that a claimant has the right to appeal  to the Social Security Tribunal if they believe the decision on their claim contravenes  the act.",47.223736842105296,14.22477192982456,15.292465652647298,18.124912280701757,15.791315789473678,10.717894736842103,60.00526315789473,9.0,3.213433417835181,0.7039244497375476,0.4784701735804579,0.0567204368676569,0.8325194248131343,0.8497080711218027,4.675438596491228,3.0,3.099930995369764,30.4,32.0,12.197267453546033,1.5219298245614037,1.0,0.8657477015821099,456,196,0.4298245614035088,2153,15,8.1.2,Scope,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes

The first major element is the existence of a labour dispute (EI Act 2(1)); which must  take place at the claimant's place of employment (EI  Act 36(5)). There must be a cause-and-effect  relationship between the employment that was lost or cannot be resumed, the  stoppage of work, and the labour dispute.

This includes proving  initial entitlement to benefits during a stoppage of work, as well as meeting  specific conditions in order to have the disentitlement suspended (EI  Act 36(3 & 4)).In this context, the Commission is responsible for gathering all  relevant information on the subject, whether favourable or unfavourable to one  party or the other. Actual facts must be examined, and not the interested  parties' interpretation of those facts.The Commission must then weigh the evidence to  rule on the claimant's entitlement to benefits. It must consider not only the  four elements that result in disentitlement to benefits, but the exempting  conditions for these provisions. The same rule applies when considering suspension  or termination of a disentitlement.",47.951222419928826,13.551918149466193,15.514038796780548,17.930391459074734,14.996690391459076,11.081850533807827,56.569750889679725,8.0,3.058113411152771,0.7590670677805069,0.5049428417418437,0.0618010176337798,0.8508576353391012,0.8527307361364365,4.750889679715303,4.0,3.1309284136820628,28.1,23.0,17.25369525637914,1.5409252669039146,1.0,0.931419456732238,281,126,0.4483985765124555,1353,10,8.1.9,Proof,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
495,495,"Strictly speaking, newspaper articles are simply a written form of  hearsay. Such published information may in principle be considered but as with  any other form of information, its credibility must be assessed at the time the  decision is actually made (FCA  A-1873-83, CUB  8750).This assessment is especially important in the case of labour disputes;  by their very nature, such disputes involve contradictory claims by the parties  involved. As for newspaper reports, it must be kept in mind that journalists have  access to information originating from both sides of the dispute; media reports  should not be accorded any importance unless their foundation and accuracy can  be verified with both parties involved; employer and union.Newspaper articles and press releases should be considered as useful  indications of the nature of a dispute in that they focus on such features as  the position of the parties concerned, sensational incidents of violence,  termination of a stoppage of work, and so on.Once these indications are available, the next step, in keeping with a  fundamental principle of natural justice, is to provide each party with an  opportunity to clarify and comment on the situation.One should not lose sight of the fact that the claimant bears the onus  of proof to entitlement to benefits. For example, with respect to exempting  conditions, claimants or their representatives are required to refute all  unfavourable facts that appear in a news item or release (FCA  A-468-00, CUB 37455).",40.93346153846153,16.77725274725275,16.084390811093357,20.3956043956044,19.840005494505498,11.740153846153843,67.52747252747253,11.285714285714286,3.385452460389736,1.0186311014871816,0.488791117087142,0.052190940024201,0.8912129700183868,0.8913440585136414,4.819230769230769,4.0,3.0473846581023984,37.142857142857146,34.0,16.119452059356036,1.515384615384615,1.0,0.892141894411037,260,147,0.5653846153846154,1263,7,8.1.10,Newspaper articles and press releases,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes

497,497,"The act gives the expression Labour Dispute a broad definition. It includes any dispute between employers and employees, or between employees themselves, that is related to employment or to the terms of employment of certain individuals, or to the fact that they are not employees (EI Act 2(1)).This definition is based on three distinct elements:the existence of a disputebetween parties to the disputewith respect to specific issues.",48.2195098039216,12.164705882352944,15.4700424275458,17.301960784313724,14.977156862745096,14.196470588235291,62.372549019607845,9.0,2.594010090298532,0.3924376330206032,0.4654069860856711,0.009783739131079,0.8214646875858307,0.8616036772727966,5.323529411764706,4.5,3.205882352941176,22.666666666666668,21.0,11.08552609887726,1.6029411764705883,1.0,0.8768208932802262,68,45,0.6617647058823529,369,3,8.2.1,Labour dispute defined,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
498,498,"The word dispute is not specifically defined in the  legislation (CUB  21211). Case law has relied on dictionary definitions to the  effect that a dispute means a difference of opinion, a controversy based on  argumentation or the expression of contrary opinions or assertions (FCA  A-186-03, CUB  56057, CUB  37885).Invariably, these definitions contain  two elements that are essential features of a dispute: evidence of insistence  by one party and resistance by the other, with respect to specific demands.  These two essential features are present when there is a refusal to negotiate, a disruption of negotiations, appointment of a  conciliator or conciliation board, when the conciliation process fails, taking  a strike vote, or issuance of a lockout notice. The existence of a strike or  lockout is even more decisive.A variety of situations may indicate that a dispute exists: ongoing negotiations,  a slowdown, the calling of special meetings, concerted formulation of  grievances, refusal to handle prohibited materials or to serve customers,  refusal to work, demonstrations, withdrawal of services, mass absenteeism or  resignation, picketing, stoppage of work, strategic shutdown of premises,  lay-off, suspension or dismissal.A labour dispute is a question of fact; it is not necessary that there  exist a strike or lockout. The essential element is a clear indication that  there is insistence by one party and resistance by another. A labour dispute  exists, and continues to exist, so long as there is insistence by one party and  resistance by the other with respect to  employment, non-employment or working conditions (CUB  39840, and CUB  21211).  Strikes and  lock-outs are pressure tactics available to employees and employers  respectively. Alone, they do not constitute a dispute; rather, they are the result  of a dispute.The existence of grievances is not enough to conclude that there is a  dispute; clearly, where a collective agreement is in force, numerous grievances  may be filed and submitted to arbitration without there being a labour dispute.  However, if a difference between the employer and the union leads to either a  legal or illegal stoppage of work resulting from a strike, lock-out or even a  major lay-off, it would be difficult to conclude that there is no labour  dispute.It cannot be argued that no dispute exists between parties negotiating a  collective agreement, simply because such negotiations are proceeding smoothly,  there is no request for conciliation, and no withdrawal of labour or picketing.  A dispute is a disagreement. The parties negotiating a collective agreement are  in disagreement. The purpose of negotiation is precisely to put an end to the  disagreement (FCA  A-787-81, CUB  6801).Nor is it realistic to claim there is no dispute where a lockout occurs before employees have had an opportunity to study the employer's proposals. The  same conclusion has been reached with respect to the argument that ongoing negotiations  did not indicate a dispute (CUB  21211).Finally, it should be noted that even if the definition of labour  dispute is broad, it does not include the refusal of one or more employees to  continue working without pay for an employer in serious financial difficulty.In a situation of economic slowdown, an employer may ask the union to  reopen the collective agreement in order to lower some monetary provisions of  the current labour contract.  Otherwise  there may be no other choice than to lay off some of the labour force, or even close  the operations (CUB  46110 and CUB  24335). The Union's refusal of such a request cannot by itself,  be considered an element of resistance which is part of a dispute. This could, however, be the starting point of a real dispute between the parties about, for  example, the conditions of the labour force reduction, or a wage reduction.",44.40166420482524,15.075028487022582,16.32212239822248,19.51266793275656,16.791957515650275,10.875273264401772,62.96187662657383,9.904761904761903,3.09044437264678,0.8590742511823519,0.4468489394350089,0.0613322730835142,0.8529983222484588,0.836679966826188,4.692762186115214,4.0,3.145439251793576,32.23809523809524,30.0,18.40265188422261,1.533234859675037,1.0,0.8442193877650829,677,259,0.3825701624815362,3215,21,8.2.2,Distinctive features of a dispute,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
499,499,"Among other considerations, in order to  meet the statutory definition of a labour  dispute, one of the parties must be the employee, and the other, either the  employer or other employees (EI Act 2(1)).A dispute may sometimes appear to be between employees and a third party  who is not the employer, for example the owner of a place of employment or the  government. If the employer has say in the matter or is bound to adopt the  position taken by the third party, then the employer is deemed a party (CUB  21211).A conflict resulting only from relations between employers, such as a  general contractor and a subcontractor on a construction site, does not meet  the definition of labour dispute. When the employer-employee relationship has  been definitively broken and there is no longer any possibility of continuing  negotiations, a dispute between an employer and employees who have recently been  temporarily laid off constitutes a labour dispute (FCA  A-0595.00;  CUB45670A; Digest  8.5.4).The very idea of a labour dispute implies that the actions of employees  are coordinated, even if only a very limited number of employees, such as those  of a single grade or class of workers, are actually involved. This would not be  the case for a disagreement between an employer and a single employee, unless  this disagreement draws in other employees who support the position taken by  the employee.The dispute need not be one between the employer of the claimant and a  group of employees; it can be any employer, doing business at the same place of  employment where the claimant works, and where the stoppage of work  attributable to a labour dispute has occurred. Although not involved in the  particular dispute, a claimant is still affected by the labour dispute  provisions simply because of working in the same place as others who have  provoked the work stoppage and the resulting general loss of employment (CUB  20493).Because of the nature of their work, those engaged in certain  administrative functions or professions may be unable to form an accredited  association under the relevant labour legislation. However, they may still join  professional associations to defend their interests and make demands. They  remain employees under the statute, and conflicts between them and their  employers are considered labour disputes (CUB  48786).  The same is true for employees who own part of  the business, so long as the employment is considered insurable and they are  not self-employed (CUB  28095).Employees may be involved in a dispute either directly, or via a  representative or trade union. Similarly, an employer may negotiate in person,  or by delegating powers to a negotiator or an association. In some cases, there  are no discussions at the local level; employers' associations or a union  federation may conduct negotiations.There is no point in questioning the legality of a representative's  mandate or of the union's accreditation. It is, however, appropriate to verify  whether the representative or the union is actually acting on behalf of the  employees, with their expressed or implied consent, and that they have not  dissociated themselves from the stand taken on their behalf (S.C.C.19094, CUB  8764). The same reasoning applies to the employer's  representative or association.When employees are directly involved in the dispute, it is immaterial  whether they are unionized or whether the union plays an active role in the  dispute. Nor is it crucial that the employees have the right to strike or that  the employer is entitled to declare a lockout. The key consideration is whether  a dispute does, in fact, exist between the parties.Labour legislation provides, among other things,  for a raiding period, and this may result in disputes between  unions about the representation of employees; some may choose to be represented  by one union while others take a different position. Disagreements resulting  from this situation are labour disputes similar to those among employees about  which union should be their bargaining agent (CUB  15967 and CUB  14236).",38.33460378474277,17.221927853341217,16.74919111956536,21.05688941454761,19.672726936723837,11.331853932584266,65.704021289178,10.578947368421051,3.296558612924544,0.5947836369784736,0.4622071289525723,0.0492840432773426,0.8942465153005388,0.8848015069961548,4.748595505617978,4.0,3.113489722500242,37.47368421052632,30.0,21.68765940891545,1.5421348314606742,1.0,0.920075683147508,712,262,0.3679775280898876,3402,19,8.2.3,Parties to the dispute,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
500,500,"The issue between parties cannot be a simple generality. The act  specifies that at least one of the following elements must be involved:the employment or non-employment of one or several individuals, ortheir terms or conditions of work.In most cases, disputes arise from negotiations related to the  resolution of a collective agreement (CUB  21211). Normally, such disputes concern terms or conditions of  employment such as wages, hours of work, job classification, productivity, job  security, union security, seniority rights or fringe benefits (CUB  15967 and CUB  14236).Sometimes labour disputes arise prior to the expiry of a collective  agreement or as a reaction to working conditions dictated by legislation. Such  disputes are often tied to differences about the application or interpretation  of a clause in a collective agreement. Thus, a labour dispute was held to exist  where there was a disagreement over the bonus plan, the method of payment, a  wage cut, hours of work, the applicable hourly rate, indexing, transportation,  identity cards, union security and the grievance procedure, departmental  transfers and the handling of prohibited materials (CUB  21211, CUB  20493 and CUB  20494).The creation of a union local or the subsequent choice of a union as  bargaining agent can also be a source of confrontation that may provoke  disputes. Here there is little question of the existence of labour disputes,  because recognition of a bargaining agent may not only considerably alter  existing working conditions, but may itself constitute a new employment  condition (CUB  21211).Dismissal or non-dismissal of fellow workers may lead to opposition that  falls within the definition of a labour dispute. Although the word  persons is in the plural in the act a dispute may still exist when  it has been brought about by even a disagreement over the employment or  non-employment of a single individual (Digest  8.2.1).However, a disagreement arising from the refusal  of employees to commit an illegal act cannot be considered a labour dispute.  Moreover, the refusal of one or many employees to work without pay should not  be included in the definition of a labour dispute.",33.49072207486003,18.99441202475685,17.879347455551382,23.121603300913645,22.202402004126142,11.817188328912463,70.80135573239022,12.11111111111111,3.592501513413021,0.9766651440493128,0.4622593395474116,0.0327857946132567,0.9056170657277108,0.8936269198145185,4.816976127320955,4.0,3.285032107762756,41.888888888888886,31.0,25.53622457279264,1.546419098143236,1.0,0.8762072623140101,377,174,0.4615384615384615,1828,9,8.2.4,Matters in dispute,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
501,501,"Application of the labour dispute provisions should not be considered if  the dispute does not take place at the claimant's place of employment. It may  be very helpful on this point to compare the claimant's place of employment  with that of the employees identified as parties to the dispute.It is quite common for the same dispute to exist at several places at  the same time. For example: where employees of different plants have joined  together in a common cause, or where employees of the same employer, but in  different places of employment, are covered by the same collective agreement.  Similarly, there are situations in which negotiations are conducted by an  association of employers and a union federation; any dispute at this level also  involves the local level (EI  Act 36(1); FCA  A-800-87, CUB 11295A; and FCA  A-209-89, CUB 16202).It is not necessary that the claimant's employer be a party to the  dispute. All that is required is a dispute between certain employees and any  employer at the claimant's place of employment (CUB  21211).Once the dispute involves a claimant's working  conditions, it may be said to exist at the claimant's place of employment (FCA  A-1198-82, CUB  7454). An outside dispute may also be extended, by sympathetic  action (Digest  8.2.9), to the claimant's own place of employment (Digest  8.3.0 to 8.3.7).",51.83614754098363,14.688711943793912,15.151101081350806,19.024824355971894,17.077751756440286,9.666229508196722,61.086651053864166,9.142857142857142,3.32739103405768,0.6232142170557056,0.4462532303698474,0.0453203637228332,0.8887651463349661,0.8691433191299438,4.475409836065574,3.5,2.8246952969407144,34.857142857142854,28.0,14.366912099171,1.4139344262295082,1.0,0.7606959253092184,244,110,0.4508196721311475,1118,7,8.2.5,Dispute at place of employment,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes

Any such  behaviour would unquestionably violate the vital principle of neutrality  imposed on administrators of public funds comprised of premiums paid by the  parties to the dispute.As we know, legislation dealing with labour disputes is not concerned  with concepts of equity, fault, merit, justice or sympathy towards either party  (FCA  A-521-86,  CUB  12543, FCA  A-226-88,  CUB 14715).

503,503,"It would be inaccurate to regard the terms labour dispute,  strike and lock-out as synonyms. Chronologically, a labour dispute usually precedes a strike or lockout, although on rare occasions they may coincide (CUB 21211).Strikes or lockouts are really only outcomes or indications of a dispute, measures of last resort that parties use to support their positions as the dispute unfolds. Signs of dissatisfaction, differences of opinion, the existence of grievances, and vague feelings of unrest or discontent are not sufficient in themselves to indicate the presence of a labour dispute.A labour dispute is usually preceded by negotiations of varying length  or intensity. The dispute itself is characterized by insistence by one party  and resistance by the other (CUB  21211). The fact that there have been no prior negotiations in a  specific case does not necessarily mean there is no dispute; one of the parties  may very well have refused to negotiate.A dispute does not necessarily arise as soon as  bargaining begins. It usually acquires focus during negotiations, as of the moment the parties adopt differing positions. Although it is a question of  fact, in some circumstances the existence of a dispute as defined in the act, as well as the moment at which it starts, are sometimes the subject of  disagreement. A labour dispute begins at the moment where insistence and  resistance among the parties can be precisely shown (Digest 8.2.2).",51.00834426229511,12.206327868852458,13.187427743715652,14.841967213114756,13.798811475409837,11.736229508196718,54.72786885245901,7.4,2.9717754478902254,0.7585756440691945,0.4526965717209619,0.0445896924255679,0.8225299848450555,0.7742598429322243,4.889344262295082,4.0,3.1218507377875158,24.4,20.0,10.734989520255716,1.5491803278688523,1.0,0.8740564844297323,244,123,0.5040983606557377,1211,10,8.2.7,Start of dispute,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
504,504,"A labour dispute exists and continues to exist so long as there is  insistence by one party and resistance by the other, with respect to the  acceptance or repeal of various provisions dealing with employment,  non-employment and working conditions of any individual. This is true, even if  this insistence or resistance relates to one or several issues other than those  that led to the strike or lock-out (CUB  21211).The dispute cannot be considered resolved until all parties agree on the  terms of settlement (FCA  A-38-96, CUB  31276). A tentative agreement between the parties to a dispute  does not necessarily bring the labour dispute to an end; such an agreement, by  definition, has no effect until it is ratified and then made definitive (FCA  A-512-88, CUB 12992A and FCA  A-814-91, CUB 20138).Thus, agreement by only one of the parties is insufficient. It is not  relevant whether the terms of a final agreement signed by the parties are the  same as those that were previously accepted by one of the parties. Even after  agreement in principle is reached, new issues may arise which prolong the  dispute or lead to another one. Examples include the refusal of employees to  return to work immediately following the settlement of a dispute, a  disagreement about a return-to-work protocol, or the controversial application  of various clauses that have already been the subject of an agreement in  principle.Presentation of an offer by one of the parties  or the clear willingness of employees to return to their jobs, even under the  former conditions, does not necessarily bring an end to the dispute. Issuance  of an ultimatum by one of the parties clearly indicates that the dispute is not  settled, even if the parties are prepared to work in the meantime.",45.07816346153848,17.06421153846154,15.742502247213078,21.05,19.896346153846157,9.70523076923077,67.39423076923077,10.875,3.5192369951810694,0.7426080184178646,0.4770890142320279,0.0363358024476243,0.9228207894733974,0.9137342472871144,4.461538461538462,3.0,2.88378449571938,40.625,41.0,12.04094576850174,1.4246153846153846,1.0,0.7633994355675487,325,147,0.4523076923076923,1460,8,8.2.8,Settlement of dispute,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
505,505,"Sometimes employees or employers who are not parties to a dispute may  still take sides with one or other of the parties involved. For a sympathetic  dispute to exist mere expressions of solidarity are not enough; there must be real  acts of solidarity (CUB  21211).Employee tactics have included sympathy strikes, or wildcat walkouts;  employers may sometimes show their solidarity by lockouts or plant shutdowns.  It is also common to refuse to handle hot materials, i.e., those  affected by an outside dispute. All of these tactics constitute labour disputes  in and of themselves (CUB  20493).At times, strikers find it advantageous to form picket lines at a place  of employment where there is no labour dispute (Digest  8.2.2; Digest  8.2.5). In other cases, workers  employed at a distinct place of employment may be faced with a picket line set  up at a common entrance. Thus, employee sympathy may also be expressed by  respecting a picket line instead of going to work.Failure to cross a picket line amounts to a form of participation in the  dispute; a dispute that has begun elsewhere is deemed to have spread to the  claimant's place of employment. Evidence of non-participation may serve to  disprove this extension of the dispute (Digest  8.6.6 and Digest 8.6.7). Taking  legal means to cross the picket line cannot by itself, of course, constitute a  labour dispute.In cases where an outside dispute has spread from one location to  another, the claimant's own terms or conditions of employment need not be  issues in dispute. The definition of a labour dispute embraces terms or  conditions of employment of any persons (EI Act 2(1)), and this  includes persons employed elsewhere than at the claimant's place of employment.",59.71803763440863,11.34758064516129,12.00992498983062,14.075268817204302,13.061505376344089,9.988387096774195,52.284946236559136,6.833333333333333,2.901964689962482,0.4044772026567592,0.4394744138617183,0.0903063518734974,0.7487503994594921,0.7018343269824981,4.580645161290323,4.0,2.8767610993053605,25.83333333333333,25.0,10.89214803832967,1.429032258064516,1.0,0.7316325308853754,310,144,0.4645161290322581,1436,12,8.2.9,Sympathetic dispute,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
506,506,"The term place of employment has been understood and applied  in much the same way for many years, and recent judgments on this subject have supported  this understanding. The act specifically  situates this concept at the factory, workshop or other premises at which the  claimant was employed.In the context of the labour dispute provisions the concept of place of  employment has a very strict connotation. It refers to a precise geographic  boundary within which all of the characteristics for the application of the  labour dispute provisions must be present.This restriction is more pronounced when there are separate activities  within the same establishment; each of these activities constitutes a distinct  place of employment (EI  Act 36(5)).Recognition of the specific nature of a place of employment may  certainly provoke disagreement; hence the need to distinguish between the  following cases:distinct geographic site;activities or services sharing the same physical site;construction industry;logging industry;commercial vehicles;businesses of national scope;merchant marine.",36.76671428571427,16.478285714285715,17.58133193835471,21.059047619047615,21.38714285714285,15.799047619047624,68.71904761904761,11.8,3.209902624919787,0.5278559500716491,0.4812773933626337,0.0344824341639797,0.8894402980804443,0.8971064289410909,5.523809523809524,4.0,3.952022358947832,33.6,26.0,19.043108989868223,1.6071428571428572,1.0,0.9388171020067796,168,100,0.5952380952380952,927,5,8.3.0,Place of employment,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
507,507,"Because there is no clear definition for the terms factory,  workshop, or other premises found in the labour dispute  provisions, these must be given their ordinary meaning, taking into account the  geographic situation at each place of employment. Usually, they refer to a very  specific geographic site (CUB  20493).Consequently, the relative proximity or distance of physical premises  where services or activities are conducted is an important factor. Two  factories located in different places are undoubtedly two distinct places of  employment, even if such establishments are under the same management or  located in the same city. The same is true for a head office located a few  kilometres from the plant; each location amounts to a distinct place of  employment.",45.64596153846156,14.966538461538462,15.903189008614271,19.15384615384616,18.08015384615385,12.327384615384616,64.03846153846153,10.25,3.220704717987327,0.5567928284332883,0.4395507873768743,0.0460649268109376,0.8824278116226196,0.9078097343444824,4.938461538461539,4.0,3.193150954425969,32.5,31.5,5.408326913195984,1.515384615384615,1.0,0.786761770067812,130,83,0.6384615384615384,644,4,8.3.1,Distinct geographic site,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
508,508,"The word premises used in the act does not necessarily mean a structure surrounded by four  walls (CUB  20493). It may mean a building and secondary structures, or all  buildings located on the same property.A thorough examination of the situation is required in order to  determine whether these are the same premises (EI  Act 36(1)) or whether they are distinct businesses, each of  which should be viewed as a distinct place of employment. The same question  arises when there appear to be different departments or services on the same  premises; the question then is whether each department constitutes a separate  and distinct establishment (EI  Act 36(5))The following elements should be considered :the nature of operations within the establishments or departments;the type of work carried out in each establishment or department;the nature of the end products or services rendered;the degree of functional integration and interdependence;the degree of interdependence of management;the physical proximity of the places of employment.It is not sufficient to have distinct types of operations being  performed, for example, the work of office employees versus that of plant  employees. The same is true for office work, maintenance, shipping, delivery  and purchasing, all of which are usually only divisions of the same firm.In the end, the test is whether the operation constitutes one or more  distinct businesses. When a firm offers two types of services amounting to  distinct businesses, for example a vending machine and a cafeteria division,  each group of workers is considered to have its own place of employment, even  where the services of each division are provided within the same plant.When several buildings share a common enclosure, they are generally  considered a single place of employment; on a practical level these structures  are only divisions of the same business. The condition, however, is that the  various branches of operations be elements of one and the same business.Departments that are normally not linked to the same firm could be  considered as separate and distinct businesses. It must be determined whether  the departments actually constitute one and the same business, or if they  should be viewed as distinct businesses.There are numerous examples of cases where various departments sharing a  common geographic site have been considered as distinct businesses. Some  examples are: an electric power plant which was considered a necessity to a  sawmill operation; a pastry business and a bakery; a sawmill and a plywood  plant or a cardboard mill; an oil refinery and the marketing division. But a  smelter and its subsidiary railway and construction operations may be regarded  as a single integrated business, even though they may be legally distinct  entities.Where several operations regarded as different businesses, such as  sawmill, a garage, a dock, a logging camp and a cardboard mill, are all administered  from an office within the mill itself, the office and mill workers are deemed  to work in the same place of employment. An exception may be made for office  employees whose duties are exclusively associated with the logging operations.In another context, a depot located within the same building as the  central administration but associated with plant operations a few kilometres  away was a distinct place of employment. The dispute involving the plant and  depot employees did not exist at the central administration building.Sometimes, it is not possible to conclude that seasonal repair work is a  distinct operation considering the ordinary operations of the plant, although  on other occasions workers employed by outside contractors, whether on  machinery installation or construction work, may be considered to have distinct  places of employment from plant employees.",43.18063793103451,15.161344827586207,15.514038796780548,18.653416927899684,18.09952978056426,12.708965517241374,64.65862068965518,10.45,3.328068362980871,0.5842998518390058,0.4435374632608875,0.0620677576672215,0.8889373948699549,0.8855906460020277,5.006269592476489,4.0,3.219740960401129,31.9,25.5,17.268178826963776,1.5517241379310345,1.0,0.8708021591550786,638,232,0.3636363636363636,3214,20,8.3.2,Activities or services sharing the same physical site,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
509,509,"This major industry employs thousands of workers in several dozen trades  across the country. Their working conditions are governed, depending on the  situation, by distinct collective agreements for each group or by legislation  applying to workers throughout a given province.It is thus not surprising that major disputes have halted operations in  this key sector of the economy and in those to which it is directly related. In  applying the labour dispute provisions of the act, it is not enough to determine that a labour dispute exists  throughout a province between construction employers and employees. It must also  be determined whether the labour dispute actually exists on the site where the  claimant is employed, and this requires an investigation for every single  construction site.A construction site is generally considered to consist of all  construction work carried out at a given geographic site. Each construction  site constitutes a distinct place of employment at which a variety of different  contractors or subcontractors are involved at different stages of construction.  Consequently, even when specific contractors have no labour dispute with their  employees, a labour dispute may still exist at their place of employment.Even when there is a generalized dispute throughout the industry, the  various construction sites cannot be treated as if they constitute a single  place of employment. There are as many places of employment as there are  construction sites. To determine whether a labour dispute exists, what must be considered  are the events that occur on the work site as a whole and not simply the  specific situation of an individual employer. The place of employment of each  construction worker is the site where the work is performed, and this site must  be clearly identified and defined.If the construction work is located at a site where other businesses in  different fields are carried on, such businesses must be considered as  different places of employment. An example would be construction work carried  out at a plant, unless the work is being performed by a division of a single  large firm. Any labour dispute arising at one of these firms or on the  construction site is thereby confined to the specific place where it arises,  unless events show that it has spread elsewhere because other employees and  employers within the same enclosure are actively involved in the dispute.A claimant's place of employment cannot be deemed to be the business  office of the employer from which the firm is managed, because the claimant was  employed at the construction site itself.A construction employee laid off after work is completed at a specific  site cannot be considered as having lost employment because of a stoppage of  work attributable to a labour dispute, if work cannot be found at another site  because of the existence of such a stoppage of work. This event has in fact not  taken place at the site where and when the claimant actually worked. The loss  of employment is really due to a shortage of work.",54.95012937371364,12.61624424188964,14.094315096169485,16.519415858080958,14.99733313731256,10.986890130353816,56.19611878859159,7.894736842105263,3.0520624520829034,0.5351601800086692,0.4651789153464674,0.0621889187065426,0.8883220354715983,0.8919956158189213,4.733705772811918,4.0,3.0234711652932296,28.26315789473684,28.0,10.421850049235667,1.456238361266294,1.0,0.7563777266313807,537,190,0.3538175046554935,2542,19,8.3.3,Construction industry,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
510,510,"Forestry operations tend to be spread over a wide area that encompasses  several divisions, such as woodlands, booming, sawmill and trucking. The  woodlands, booming and sawmill divisions are all different places of employment.  Trucking is usually part of the woodlands operations. Each camp within the  woodlands division may be considered as a distinct place of employment, so long  as it is reasonably distant and operated independently.Where a claimant was employed in unloading saw logs, the place of  employment was the woodlands division to which the claimant was assigned and  not the nearby sawmill. Similarly, office workers whose duties related  exclusively to the woodlands operations were deemed to be employed at a  different place from that of their co-workers, whose duties related to other  divisions.On another occasion, it was held that the labour dispute which had provoked  the claimant's stoppage of work really took place where he was working. As soon  as the conflict became an issue related to the claimant's working conditions,  the only possible conclusion was that the dispute existed at the place where he  was working  (FCA  A-1198-82, CUB  16592).  The argument that the premises of the employer was a truck driver's place  of employment rather than the place where he regularly delivered logs, where a labour  dispute existed, was not accepted. In fact, even though the claimant was not  employed by the employer who was a party to the labour dispute, at least part  of his employment occurred at the premises where the labour dispute existed.",55.56031818181821,12.341545454545455,13.81666964889586,16.09090909090909,14.465563636363632,10.770327272727268,57.68181818181819,8.3,3.0116765204266827,0.6721026918715253,0.469755153364338,0.035759237716722,0.885846303568946,0.8809360936284065,4.701818181818182,4.0,2.765731263425209,27.5,28.5,10.0024996875781,1.4581818181818182,1.0,0.7489849880983559,275,121,0.44,1306,10,8.3.4,Logging industry,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes

There must be a  stoppage of work for the labour dispute provisions to apply (Digest  8.1.3).It is important to be aware that, virtually from day to day, the  application of the labour dispute provisions will depend on the development of  the stoppage of work, and whether it occurred on one or several specific days.  This is very much a day concept, particularly when there are  irregular stoppages of work, for example, during sporadic strikes and rotating  walkouts.The issue is whether a business or a given place of employment are  continuing normal day to day operations, despite the presence of a labour  dispute. This may be difficult to determine when, for example, there is a  work-to-rule, a partial slowdown, or when essential services are being well  maintained.Everything depends on what is meant by stoppage of work. It may be that  a stoppage of work takes place once the work that the employer offers and  wishes to have performed is not carried out or completed because some of the  employees have stopped working. But it is much less obvious that there is a  stoppage of work when only one or several employees within a large group of  workers withdraw their services.",57.31539473684211,12.345175438596495,12.815532586354998,15.435087719298249,13.725789473684207,9.26035087719298,55.69298245614036,7.75,3.2767239874511844,0.8763644408284428,0.472114806570191,0.0796056206054395,0.8762919817652021,0.8750744561354319,4.43859649122807,4.0,2.7226634525363504,28.5,28.0,14.908051515875574,1.4254385964912282,1.0,0.7306943829791827,228,107,0.4692982456140351,1018,8,8.4.0,Stoppage of work,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
515,515,"Since the act does not define  stoppage of work (EI Regulation 53), the term should be given its ordinary  meaning. It should not be confused with labour dispute, of which it is only one  outcome (Digest  8.2.1 and Digest  8.2.2).A stoppage of work within the context of a labour dispute cannot be  defined in terms of the work of individual employees, but rather by referring  in general to what constitutes the normal operations of a business (Digest  8.4.2). The latter include not only production departments, but also  office work, maintenance services, and others.A stoppage of work refers to a breakdown in the normal operations of a  firm or to a change in the usual delivery of services, as a result of a  reduction in operations and in the number of employees. The fact that  activities continue elsewhere will be of no consequence as it is the activities  at the premises where the claimant worked that are relevant (CUB  15424).A stoppage of work does not refer only to a strike or lock-out (CUB  80535). It may also be used to refer to production slowdowns, concerted  refusals of work, mass absenteeism, walkouts, suspensions, dismissals and  shutdowns.      Even lay-offs resulting from the dispute may be deemed to cause a  stoppage of work or help make a partial stoppage of work more widespread. Other  examples include suspension of the night shift or a refusal to work normal  overtime.Not resuming work after a general lay-off or at the beginning of the  active season could also be a sign of a stoppage of work, if it is established  that activities would normally have resumed at a given time. The delay in  resuming the normal activities at a specific moment may be seen as a stoppage  of the normal activity (EI  Act 36; Digest  8.4.3 and Digest  8.5.2).To conclude, the existence of a stoppage of work depends on the impact  of the labour dispute upon the normal operations of the business (Digest  8.11.1). If the dispute has a marked effect on these operations, then there is  a stoppage of work. There is no requirement that this stoppage of work be  generalized throughout the firm (CUB  21211). The stoppage may even be confined to a certain number of  employees, or to a single operation, so long as it has some significant impact  in terms of a slowdown or change of normal operations carried out by this more  limited group of employees (Digest  8.4.2).Clearly, a walkout that has only a negligible impact on the operation of  a group does not meet this definition of stoppage of work. However, it would be  very difficult for claimants who willingly participate in this partial strike to  prove they are unable to find suitable work. Such situations may arise, for  example, during the period preceding a generalized stoppage of work.",52.06717380025943,14.509797665369652,13.867442237049442,17.83118028534371,16.311874189364467,9.064046692607004,57.41841763942931,7.933333333333334,3.1371981487771032,0.7151811680615545,0.4679545783103054,0.0364806332968463,0.8681679580892835,0.8837868571281433,4.375486381322958,4.0,2.8224127742928697,34.266666666666666,26.0,18.93309859009408,1.4182879377431907,1.0,0.7525160046971221,514,206,0.4007782101167315,2258,15,8.4.1,Stoppage of work defined,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
516,516,"The existence of a labour dispute does not necessarily imply a sudden  halt to all operations of a business, without prior signs. There may be several  measures and events related to negotiations and the willingness of the parties  to reach a concrete agreement.Nowhere in the act is  there any standard that measures a stoppage of work or its scope to determine if  it fits the definition. The approach generally adopted has been that there be  an appreciable reduction in the normal operations of a business before reaching  any conclusion that a stoppage of work exists within the terms of the labour  dispute provisions.Reference has often been made to the business as a whole in order to  measure this reduction in operations; however, at other times this has been  confined only to employees on strike, to a single department or service within  a firm, or to employees of a single bargaining unit (FCA  A-340-79, CUB  12992A). A dispute between the employer and a specific group of  workers can disrupt the activities of this group and yet not significantly  affect the operations of the business as a whole. This does not mean that there  is no stoppage of work.  Rather, a total  stoppage of work or a marked reduction in work in any major department of a  firm constitutes a stoppage of work, no matter whether this involves production  or support services, such as administration or maintenance. This may be the  case even if a single activity within a department is interrupted, or if other  operations of the business continue more or less normally, despite the stoppage  of work.Depending on whether or not the dispute and stoppage of work have  repercussions on the entire firm or only on specific operations, the reduction  in operations attributable to the dispute can be measured against the entire  firm, or only those operations affected by the labour dispute.Among the many indicators that can individually reflect a business's  level of operations, there are two main ones that have been established and  used historically to determine whether a stoppage of work has occurred. First is  the production of goods and services in terms of both quality and quantity.  Even if, from a quantitative standpoint, a near-normal production level is  maintained, there is still a stoppage of work if there is an appreciable  decline in quality (CUB  69099C).The number of employees still at work is the second determining factor.  Although it is not the sole and absolute test, it generally corresponds to the  level of production. The level of income of the business, however, is not an  element to be considered.There is clearly a significant reduction in the normal activity where  the production of goods or services has completely ceased or where there are no  longer any employees at work. However, how does one judge the situation where  the presence of a dispute influences the drop in production or in the number of  employees at work, but there is not yet a total interruption. What must be  determined is when exactly the reduction in the normal activities that  corresponds to a stoppage of work, occurred.Similarly, it must later be determined whether there is a termination in  the stoppage of work. What must be considered in either case, is the level of  employees at work and the level of the production of goods and services of a  business or a group of workers, and not what their normal level would be, had  there not been a labour dispute and a stoppage of work.The regulations that define what constitutes the termination of the  stoppage of work should be used to resolve the question of when the stoppage of  work occurs and continues. The stoppage of work ends, according to the  regulation, when the number of employees at work and the activities in respect  of the production of goods and services represent at least 85% of their normal  level (Digest  8.11.1). If this minimum of 85% is not attained in one or the other case,  the stoppage of work continues to exist.When determining the start of the stoppage of work, the reverse of the 85%  rule (i.e., a reduction of more than 15% of the work force or activities), is  one factor that can be used.  This  factor, however, should not be systematically applied. There must be  flexibility in its application, as, in any given situation, there are  indicators which reveal an appreciable stoppage of work, such as a significant  reduction in the production of goods or services or in the number of employees  at work, as compared to the normal situation.There may be occasions, however, whether, due to exceptional or  temporary measures that, in spite of the dispute, the employer maintains or  resumes a normal level in terms of the number of employees at work or in the  activities related to the production of goods or services. What must then be  determined is what the actual situation would have been without these  exceptional or temporary measures. It may be concluded that a stoppage of work  occurred in the case where, in the absence of such, there would have been a  significant reduction in the number of employees or in the activities related  to the production of goods or services, when compared to the normal situation.",51.64856603773586,13.955396226415097,14.458980052321824,17.667589098532495,15.502075471698111,9.525786163522014,56.85241090146751,7.966666666666667,3.304762058721499,0.7769155542441788,0.4521808613095395,0.0705796358504741,0.885936687732565,0.8898836203983852,4.465408805031447,4.0,2.93596196017942,31.8,32.0,13.7195723937252,1.4528301886792452,1.0,0.8115888592170334,954,253,0.2651991614255765,4283,30,8.4.2,Scope of work stoppage,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
517,517,"The word attributable inserted between stoppage of  work and labour dispute (EI  Act 36(1))  in the act was added to establish  a cause-and-effect relationship between a labour dispute and a stoppage of  work. The labour dispute provisions specifically contemplate a stoppage of work  as a direct result of a labour dispute.In addition to the fact that a stoppage of work cannot exist without its  cause (FCA A-354-79, CUB  5193B; FCA  A-512-88, CUB  12992A), this relationship must also exist at the claimant's  actual place of employment. A stoppage of work due to a dispute at another  place of employment does not meet this condition unless that dispute has also  resulted in a dispute at the claimant's own place of employment (CUB  20493 and CUB  16592).When there is a generalized dispute at several places of employment, for  example, in the construction industry or in public transit, the stoppage of  work must be distinctly established for each place of employment. The stoppages  may occur at different dates depending on the actual situation at each of these  places. The fact that it is one and the same dispute does not change that.When a stoppage of work arises during a labour dispute, the  cause-and-effect relationship is a logical deduction unless some other  explanation for the situation can be proven. In the case of an employer who  indicates they will temporarily close the business if such a cause-and-effect  relation is established, this clearly supports that the stoppage of work was a  direct result of a labour dispute.This relationship is all the more obvious when the stoppage of work  takes the form of a strike or lockout; by its very nature, this type of event  is directly linked to the existence of a labour dispute. The fact that a  lockout was declared the day before the employer shut down operations, only to  reopen two days later with a reduced labour force, does not change this  relationship. Other forms of stoppages of work are also attributable to a  labour dispute where the stoppage results from earlier negotiations; however,  the lack of negotiations is not a crucial factor.The link between the stoppage of work and the dispute need not be  direct, so long as the stoppage of work can be said to be an event related to  the dispute or that, had there been no dispute, the stoppage of work would not  have occurred. The latter is true even when the stoppage of work is provoked by  others, and not by the employees or the employer.Without formally denying the existence of a labour dispute, some have  linked work stoppages to causes unrelated to the dispute: the economic  situation, the impending move of the business, overproduction, seasonal market  fluctuations, weather and even natural disasters. As is always the case, the  relevant facts must be examined in reaching a decision; there is no issue with claims  where it is established that, had there been no dispute, the firm would still have  shut down (Digest  8.11.3 and Digest  8.11.4). But it is important to keep in mind that in many disputes not  everyone plays by the rules. With action and reaction, demand and resistance,  threat and counter-threat, it is always appropriate to ask where reality  actually begins, and on what objective and undisputed facts conclusions can be  based (CUB  21211). The mere fact that an employer takes advantage of a  stoppage of work to prepare to move operations or to make renovations is not  conclusive.Some may claim that the stoppage of work was caused by lay-offs  resulting from a shortage of work. It is important to go beyond the events  themselves, and clarify whether the shortage of work resulted from the labour  dispute, or if lay-offs would have taken place regardless. When rumours of a  strike result in fewer orders and thus provoke numerous lay-offs, the resulting  stoppage of work is deemed to be attributable to the dispute.      Generalized absenteeism under the pretext of illness is sometimes used  as a strategy during a labour dispute. Similarly, the claim that a stoppage of  work was provoked by acts of vandalism is of no help where the sabotage is  attributable to the dispute.When there are two causes for the stoppage of work, the issue then is  whether the dispute is the principal cause. Generally a subsequent event will  not change the cause-and-effect relationship between the dispute and the  original cause of the stoppage of work, unless the dispute becomes of secondary  importance. This subsequent event then becomes the principal cause of the  stoppage of work; examples include fires or natural disasters. Even if it is  established that the original cause of the stoppage of work had nothing to do  with the dispute, the fact that, because of a dispute, there is a delay in the  return to work following a period of lay-off or at the beginning of the season,  constitutes a stoppage of work attributable to the dispute (Digest 8.4.1 and Digest  8.5.2; CUB  80780).",52.610892531876175,14.340109289617484,13.90115768025156,17.752276867030965,16.31565755919854,9.294950819672133,57.27686703096539,7.925925925925926,3.196073402186187,0.6378525750819041,0.4741805685094933,0.0583131319300924,0.8928786768363073,0.8909141111373902,4.416393442622951,4.0,2.746951434590848,33.888888888888886,32.0,15.169006738481553,1.4163934426229507,1.0,0.7409594270439555,915,294,0.321311475409836,4070,27,8.4.3,Cause-and-effect relationship between labour dispute and stoppage of work,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
518,518,"We have already noted that, for the labour dispute provisions to apply, four well-defined elements must be present (Digest 8.1.3). After establishing that a labour dispute exists, which resulted in a stoppage of work, at the claimant's place of employment, the fourth element comes into play.  That is, to determine whether the claimant has lost employment or is unable to resume an employment because of this stoppage of work.Despite its apparent complexity, this issue is not difficult to address. Everything rests on three basic concepts:loss of employment or unable to resume employment,relationship between this fact and a stoppage of work,the claimant's status in this context.",59.30740540540543,10.502234234234232,12.340626583579944,13.564684684684686,13.30486486486486,12.37261261261261,52.83063063063062,6.8,3.3544975280710574,1.0097770493111549,0.4594971509971509,0.0724172582450242,0.8614680767059326,0.8479556242624918,5.018018018018018,4.0,2.697953785798782,22.2,23.0,6.273754856543249,1.4774774774774777,1.0,0.7455193104712504,111,73,0.6576576576576577,578,5,8.5.0,Loss of employment unable to resume an employment,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
519,519,"From the standpoint of entitlement to benefits, loss of employment basically refers to an interruption of earnings from employment (FCA A-592-99, CUB 45449). This does not mean that an interruption of less than seven consecutive days is not a loss of employment. The terms used and the reasons invoked make little difference, whether in respect of a strike, leaving or failing to show up for work, refusal to cross the picket line, lock-out, or suspension.In these circumstances, there is no denying that the employer-employee relationship may be affected by the existence of a dispute, especially if it evolves into a stoppage of work. Usually there is not a total breakdown in relations between the parties. In principle, each has an interest in reaching some common ground that may produce an eventual solution to the dispute. Most provincial codes as well as the Canada Labour Code include specific provisions guaranteeing the employee's right, with precedence over any other individual, to return to work when operations start up again.Few stoppages of work amount to a permanent separation between the parties, in the form of resignation, dismissal or even lay-off, arising prior to or after the start of a stoppage of work, or even once the stoppage of work has ended (Digest 8.5.5, Digest 8.5.6 and Digest 8.13.0).Loss of employment may also result from bumping based on years of seniority, or postponing work to a later date, even where the total time worked according to the collective agreement is eventually honoured (FCA A-1415-84, CUB 9598). The fact that another job has been found immediately does not mean there has been no loss of employment.The wording of the legislation relating to labour disputes (EI Act 36(1)) requires that the loss of every employment the claimant held at the time of the stoppage of work, be taken into account.  This is the case regardless of whether the claimant was working at more than one job at the time their employment was lost, or if employment was continued in other jobs afterwards. This also includes employment that a claimant expected to start with a new employer at a definite date, but could not start because of a stoppage of work attributable to a labour dispute. The wording applies to all previous employment that the claimant was unable to resume, for the same reason (Digest 8.5.2).The employment at issue must nonetheless meet the definition found in the legislation (EI Act 2(1)), which effectively eliminates self-employment, as there is no employer-employee relationship. As long as this employment falls within the definition, it may also include any employment worked in Canada or overseas, as well as employment that does not meet the minimum conditions regarding insurability.",46.73,14.868571428571432,16.17404787264403,19.46126013724267,17.962950717404865,12.053275109170304,60.661883967560826,9.142857142857142,3.4553557157817094,0.7003433670268977,0.4701573565950703,0.0596093715978664,0.8418189195486215,0.8556839426358541,4.890829694323144,4.0,2.8486346552240733,32.714285714285715,32.0,17.563877587775636,1.5,1.0,0.8443234546486725,458,225,0.4912663755458515,2302,14,8.5.1,Loss of employment,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
520,520,"Because the specific phrase a claimant . . . unable to resume an employment, because of a work stoppage attributable to a labour dispute appears in the legislation (EI Act 36(1)), this claimant is subject to the provisions concerning labour disputes.Accordingly a claimant, on leave when the stoppage occurred, who could not, after a period of vacation, illness, injury or maternity, resume their employment because the stoppage of work continued, would be connected to the loss of employment attributable to the stoppage of work. The disentitlement, should it apply, would be effective the date the claimant was to have returned to work (CUB 21571and CUB 20347).The connection may be more difficult to find in cases where a claimant is not able to resume employment after a leave of absence for union business (FCA A-661-83, CUB 8639). Similar issues may arise between casual workers who are subject to recall, and seasonal workers. (FCA A-787-81, CUB 6801; FCA -1036-92, CUB 21236; and FCA A-549-81, CUB 6827). These claimants do not literally lose employment at the beginning of the active season but, rather, the possibility of employment.In order to eliminate all the ambiguity as to whether the provisions concerning labour disputes applied in a claimant's situation, it was necessary to add a specific reference to a claimant . . . who is unable to resume an employment in the legislation (EI Act 36(1)). This establishes an equitable treatment of a claimant who has lost employment and a claimant who is unable to resume employment, when both are for the same reasons.With respect to situations where the leave is of a longer duration, for example, for union business or working at another job, it is more appropriate to consider the question whether the claimant is unable to resume an employment. This approach should also be used where a claimant is unable to resume an employment on return or recall to work after a lay-off or at the end of a contract. The same could be said for the casual or seasonal worker whose return to work is prevented by the fact that there is a stoppage of work attributable to a labour dispute (Digest 8.5.8).This does not mean that all persons who have a possibility of being recalled by the employer during a stoppage of work automatically fall under the category of claimants who are unable to resume an employment. At the outset it must be reasonably concluded that, had it not been for the stoppage of work, the employer would have taken these workers back at a given date or time, and consequently, in the absence of the stoppage of work, these workers would have been at their jobs. However, an unconfirmed possibility or non-assurance of working, or the sole existence of a right of recall, is not sufficient to arrive at such a conclusion.The employment to which we refer must be an employment that the claimant held in the past, regardless of whether it is in the recent or distant past. It is not limited in any way to the employment that the claimant held immediately prior to their last employment or prior to the filing of their claim for benefits. This expression may even refer to an employment at which, for one reason or another, the claimant has stopped working during the benefit period, and did not later resume because of a stoppage of work due to a labour dispute.It must however be in respect of the same employer for whom the claimant has already held employment, but not necessarily in the same occupation or even the same place of employment. The fact that a claimant could not, because of the stoppage of work, commence a job at a date provided by an employer, for whom they have never worked, does not fall within this category. What would be more at issue there, is whether the loss of employment would be subject to the labour dispute provisions.Finally, it must be emphasized that a claimant who . . . is unable to resume an employment also includes those persons who are prevented from resuming their employment because of a stoppage of work, as well as those who decide, voluntarily, not to resume their employment.",52.48304347826088,13.553851372186248,14.175741079098875,17.140302189330864,15.8894486586494,10.691007092198582,56.467776749922905,7.913043478260869,3.4581298178331368,0.5981590926419086,0.4534532389424328,0.0862450498991913,0.8334790197285739,0.8283162769817171,4.669503546099291,4.0,2.7423638212318964,30.65217391304348,31.0,14.454151489247026,1.4567375886524825,1.0,0.7690193593869507,705,239,0.3390070921985815,3388,23,8.5.2,Unable to resume an employment,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
521,521,"Many events in everyday life are linked by what is called the domino effect, a kind of chain reaction by which one-event causes a second, which creates a third. The labour dispute clause has a similar effect with respect to three events: labour dispute, stoppage of work and loss of employment or being unable to resume an employment (Digest 8.1.3).The term work stoppage does not refer to the employees' labour, but rather to the employer's operations (CUB 16553). A work stoppage means a stoppage of the normal activity of the employer's business.  The stoppage of work may be caused by a strike or lockout, which may be legal or illegal.  The Commission has the burden to show that there was a work stoppage.  A permanent closure of the business is not a work stoppage attributable to a labour dispute.Loss of employment or being unable to resume an employment, and a stoppage of work do not necessarily take place at the same time. Following the reasoning inherent in the labour dispute clause, this loss or inability to resume employment within the meaning of that clause must occur following the commencement of the stoppage of work, or must at the very least coincide with it. The issue then is whether this loss or inability follows an event associated with the dispute and the stoppage of work (CUB 39840 and CUB 21211) or whether it would not have occurred at that specific time, had there not been a stoppage of work (CUB 76451 and CUB 56343). In either case, it is reasonable to conclude that a cause-and-effect relationship between these events indeed exists. Whether the relationship is direct or indirect is not relevant.While the situation is far less clear when loss of employment or being unable to resume an employment precedes the stoppage of work, an effect cannot precede its cause. Consequently, a claimant who lost employment or was unable to resume it prior to a stoppage of work is not covered by the labour dispute provisions (EI Act 27, EI Act 28, EI Act 29; Digest 8.5.5 and Digest 8.5.6). Whether or not the loss of employment or being unable to resume it can be blamed on an imminent stoppage of work is not relevant.Employees are often on leave at the time of a stoppage of work. Relations with the employer are not definitively broken in such circumstances, even if the leave is unpaid. A person who is unable to return to work once the leave ends is considered to have lost an employment, or is unable to resume an employment because of a stoppage of work, if the stoppage is still in progress (Digest 8.5.2 and Digest 8.5.7).Sometimes an employee's status at the time of the stoppage of work can be difficult to determine. The case of a full or part-time employee, working on a temporary, permanent or probationary basis, generally poses no real problem. There is a clear link between the loss of employment or being unable to resume an employment, and the stoppage of work for the period the employee would have remained at work, had such stoppage of work not taken place.The situation of a casual worker is much less clear. This situation must be determined in terms of the job history and the likelihood of continuing at the job had there been no stoppage of work (Digest 8.5.12).For an employee who is reinstated in the job following a grievance, the fact that the employee's status at the time of the stoppage of work was not known until several months following the stoppage is not relevant. Consequently, the ruling on loss of employment must be reconsidered in light of the new status, even if the claimant is not aware of this fact until after the stoppage of work (CUB 16582).An employee whose job was scheduled to come to an end after the commencement of the stoppage of work for reasons unrelated to the dispute may be in a similar situation as an employee who has received final notice of dismissal effective after the beginning of the stoppage of work. The relationship between the initial loss of employment and the stoppage of work remains unchanged (FCA A-181-83, CUB 7842A;  FCA A-270-91, CUB 19037) until such time as the employer-employee relationship is permanently severed  (FCA A-942-85, CUB 11403 and FCA A-1036-92, CUB 21236; Digest 8.13.0).",53.46969845722302,13.837480130902293,13.981356848031757,17.40149602618046,16.185808204768584,10.053172043010754,54.52524544179524,7.173913043478261,3.241842961834839,0.9329985473119082,0.4779220270947037,0.0553462680282719,0.8460645187984813,0.847671872093564,4.55241935483871,4.0,2.660431801893936,32.34782608695652,25.0,19.441347009273088,1.424731182795699,1.0,0.7256670515276235,744,251,0.3373655913978494,3472,23,8.5.3,Loss of or unable to resume employment because of a stoppage of work,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
522,522,"Several factors may complicate a labour dispute, including the number of parties actually involved. This often happens when a dispute involves an employer or an association of employers and several locals of the same union or even several unions. The first issue is to determine whether one or several disputes are underway at the claimant's place of employment.Generally, there are as many labour disputes as there are collective agreements under negotiation. There is a single dispute when the major issues relate to a master collective agreement, when negotiations deal with the industry as a whole or when various groups of workers form a common front, creating for example a joint committee or even making the signing of each collective agreement an essential condition for the settlement of every dispute (FCA A-512-88, CUB 12992A; FCA A-814-91, CUB 20138). Where there is more than one dispute at the claimant's place of employment, the impact of each stoppage of work on the loss of employment or being unable to resume an employment in question must be identified.When several unions are locked out by an employer, the resulting stoppage of work may be attributable to all of the disputes, and not simply to a single dispute (CUB 67605, CUB 39832A, and CUB 25474). The fact that one union is responsible for the event that brought about the lockout, or that this event occurred at another place of work, is of little importance.The situation can be illustrated where blue and white-collar workers are negotiating with the same employer for the renewal of their respective collective agreements. To back up their demands, the blue-collar workers go on strike, and this results in some of the white-collar workers being laid off. It is necessary at this stage to decide if there is one complex dispute, in which both white and blue-collar workers are involved, or two distinct labour disputes. The question is important, specifically because the exempting conditions apply only with respect to the dispute which resulted in the work stoppage, and led to some white-collar workers being laid off.In this situation, there are clearly two labour disputes involved.  If the employer locked out the white-collar workers a few weeks after the blue-collar workers launched their own strike, the lay-offs of the white-collar workers prior to the lockout are considered to have been caused by the blue-collar strike, and therefore fall under the labour dispute provisions (EI Act 36(1)). The white-collar workers in this case lost, or may have been unable to resume their employment due to a stoppage of work attributable to a labour dispute of blue-collar workers. However, if it can be shown that they were not concerned with that labour dispute those white-collar workers would likely not have any difficulty meeting the exempting conditions (EI Act 36(4)).The situation would be different if the employer, equally in dispute with the white-collar workers, decides to lock them out. From that point on, it would be considered that the white-collar workers, who had earlier been laid off, could not resume their employment due to a stoppage of work attributable to two labour disputes in progress. In this context it becomes more difficult for these white-collar workers to prove that they continue to meet the exempting conditions, as they have become parties to the labour dispute.",50.77424742167739,14.05802393461763,13.731508374201276,17.0321463319712,17.172739832652262,11.657723292469347,57.99192449892975,8.333333333333334,3.3812347873536,0.9747753876561824,0.4718799914363418,0.0552127494099467,0.8792183223892661,0.879658468067646,4.828371278458844,4.0,2.5189927883494447,31.72222222222222,30.0,14.363555562431667,1.4640980735551663,1.0,0.7248576290041623,571,221,0.3870402802101576,2835,18,8.5.4,Multiple disputes or stoppages,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
523,523,"The fact that a dispute is underway and a stoppage of work is imminent, when the lay-off of one or several employees takes place, may be due simply to chance and be unrelated to the lay-off. It may be the same when an employer cancels the fixed recall of a number of employees. These cases are not subject to the labour dispute provisions.The same cannot be said when the lay-off or the cancellation of a recall is attributable to the existence of a labour dispute and to signs of an impending stoppage of work. This relationship may be the result of outside factors, such as a breach of the contract or postponement of orders by customers who fear that, given the circumstances, these will not be completed within deadlines, or who support a boycott organized by the union. Or it may be the result of internal considerations, in reaction to initiatives taken by workers, such as a work slowdown, or in anticipation of operational problems following an intentional damage of equipment. It is not unusual in these situations for employees to be suspended or dismissed because of their involvement in such incidents, even prior to the stoppage of work occurring (Digest 7.3.0).Although the wording of the labour dispute provisions (EI Act 36(1)) refers specifically to loss of employment or being unable to resume it as a result of a stoppage of work, the interpretation historically followed has been that these provisions may apply in anticipation of a stoppage of work. It is enough to show a cause-and-effect relationship between either of these events and the stoppage of work, even if this is only impending.The numbers of days between the lay-off or cancellation of a recall, and the stoppage of work, as well as the fact that a strike mandate has been given to the union executive, may be signs of an anticipated work stoppage. The eventuality of such a stoppage of work in the short term may well prompt an employer to lay-off or to cancel the recall or return to work of some or all of their employees. The shorter the interval between the lay-off or cancellation of recall and the stoppage of work, the more likely it is that these events are linked to the stoppage of work. It is imperative that the stoppage of work actually take place in order for a claimant to be disentitled from benefits.  If a disentitlement applies, it cannot take effect until the first day of the stoppage of work. When the lay-off or cancellation of the recall has two originating causes, the issue is whether or not the imminence of the stoppage of work is the principal one.This approach is clearly supported by the strict wording of the labour dispute clause (FCA A-0595-00, CUB 45670A; CUB 76451 and CUB 56343). Consistent application of the labour dispute provisions avoids a double standard, depending on whether a worker lost employment or is unable to resume it immediately before or after a stoppage of work.Jurisprudence has held that the timing of events is important; an actual stoppage of work is essential and must precede or coincide with the loss of employment referred to by the labour dispute provisions (CUB 9830A). This may be significant where the lay-off occurs for a reason related to an employee's specific situation. In this context, the claimant who is permanently laid off, as an isolated incident prior to the stoppage of work, with no chance of recall, will not be considered to have lost employment because of the stoppage of work. The fact that the loss of employment was caused by the impending stoppage of work has no effect on entitlement to benefits in these circumstances. The same principle may be applied in the case of the claimant whose return to work with an employer on a fixed date was permanently cancelled, with no hope of returning, due to the imminent stoppage of work.Precedence is generally given to the interpretation applied in most judgments, especially in cases where there are mass lay-offs or cancellations of recalls before a stoppage of work. Usually these employees are involved or implicated in the labour dispute. The application of the labour dispute provisions cannot automatically be ignored, simply because the loss of employment or being unable to resume it precedes the stoppage of work. The finality of the lay-offs or cancellation of recall, as well as each individual's situation, must be carefully considered.Where an employee is suspended prior to the stoppage of work for activities connected with the dispute, or for other reasons, this loss of employment cannot be considered definitive. The provisions of the labour dispute clause would apply, but only from the end of the suspension period.  This is because it is at that moment that the loss of employment is considered to be a result of the stoppage of work caused by the dispute.There is general agreement that based on what has been said above, it is inappropriate to apply the labour dispute provisions to a permanent dismissal that occurred before the stoppage of work. This is not the case when, after settlement of a grievance, an employee is reinstated and all rights are recognized retroactively. The labour dispute provisions apply in this case from the beginning of the stoppage of work in the same way as they do to all employees, even if the claimant's status as an employee was actually only defined several months later  (CUB 16582).",50.46354838709678,13.721594982078855,14.554592549557764,17.376564653984012,15.581357526881725,10.577991452991451,54.76619795974635,7.419354838709677,3.2305002177876383,0.7406696525509626,0.4941529695248161,0.0526744783621389,0.9012800951798756,0.9027741078672736,4.652777777777778,4.0,2.88196439597666,30.193548387096776,30.0,12.59907665546326,1.4861111111111112,1.0,0.8434130425265509,936,290,0.3098290598290598,4451,31,8.5.5,Lay-off prior to stoppage of work,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
524,524,"Voluntarily leaving a job is not the same as a lay-off, as it is the claimant who takes the initiative to break the links with the employer; the break is not dictated or imposed by the employer. The same may be said when a person decides not to go back to work at a given date.A claimant's voluntary decision to quit employment or not to resume employment while a labour dispute is underway, or when a stoppage of work seems imminent, may be motivated by the stoppage of work or by totally independent reasons. In the latter case the labour dispute provisions should not be considered in ruling on these reasons.The threat of a potentially lengthy labour dispute may lead a claimant to make certain decisions with respect to their future, based on an evaluation of the situation, personal criteria, and the claimant's position within the firm. For example, a claimant may voluntarily resign or not resume an employment prior to the stoppage of work because they believe that the strike will last a long time, they do not support the union demands, or they wish to return to studies.Whether the decision to voluntarily leave employment was made in anticipation of a stoppage of work, or for other reasons, one thing is for certain: after this definitive resignation, the claimant is no longer an employee of the firm. It cannot later be said that employment was lost or not resumed because of a stoppage of work attributed to a labour dispute.  This is because the employment has already been deliberately lost or not resumed, even if it was in anticipation of a stoppage of work (FCA A-1082-84).  The labour dispute provisions would not apply.Although if may appear that this approach is inconsistent with the provisions of the legislation, the fact that benefits will not be denied based on these provisions does not necessarily mean that benefits will in fact be paid to a claimant in this situation.  Other provisions of the legislation must be applied in making the final determination regarding entitlement to benefits, including, but not limited to whether just cause exists for voluntarily leaving employment, or whether all qualifying and entitlement conditions are met.A distinction must be made between loss of employment resulting from a genuine resignation and one that could be considered a fabricated departure.  The former is a case of a genuine individual resignation which amounts to a complete and permanent break in the employer-employee relationship. There is no risk that benefits the claimant might receive would influence the claimant's behaviour in the dispute. By totally changing their status, these individuals can never become strikers. They may thus avoid the provisions relating to labour disputes, however, whether they will actually receive benefits would be considered under the provisions of voluntary quitting or refusal to resume work (EI Act 29(1)).In the case of a fabricated departure, the resignation may be reversible because the employer-employee relationship is not totally broken; either the employee has not yet taken that final step, or the break is only superficial in that the employee is involved in picketing or other union activities. The same is true for mass resignations, which are usually only one of several pressure tactics used against the employer to force the granting of demands. The employees' interests remain linked to the future of the business.EI benefits should in no way be used to assist employees who are on strike or who have an interest in the dispute. In this context, the traditional approach continues to be justified in that the claimant has clearly left employment because of an impending stoppage of work without, however, breaking all links with the employer. It is the same when the claimant, voluntarily, and for these same reasons, does not resume a previous employment, without definitively breaking all links with the employer. Disentitlement to benefits takes effect from the first day of the stoppage of work, provided of course that such a stoppage actually begins.Loss of employment that occurs between a claimant's fabricated resignation (one that is actually linked to a labour dispute), and the start of a stoppage of work which may never occur, could be considered under the provisions of disqualification under section 27(1)(a), (b) of the act. A worker who voluntarily fails to report for work on a day to day basis because of a dispute and impending stoppage of work would have difficulty proving they are unable to find suitable employment.  Because employment is available with the employer and this worker chose not to take it, the issue to consider is the individual's availability for work. A disentitlement pursuant to section 18(a) of the act would likely be justified for as long as the employee fails to show up for work, until the stoppage of work occurs (EI Act 36). This principle also applies to the claimant, who voluntarily does not resume an employment for the same reasons, without definitively breaking all links with the employer.The labour dispute provisions will not apply to those who can show that they have truly resigned their employment by completely separating from the employer, before the start of the stoppage of work. In the case of a fabricated or non-permanent separation, the claimant will be disentitled because of a failure to prove availability during the period from the date they leave employment, until the start of the stoppage of work.",47.1888631732169,14.262759825327514,15.33710200688057,18.19586608442504,16.846764919941776,11.956550218340611,60.22765647743815,9.066666666666666,2.9870448853977427,0.6587107008311973,0.4746542047791323,0.062431507205459,0.8782496863398058,0.8728572853973934,4.885371179039302,4.0,2.8639004409351534,30.53333333333333,27.5,13.922962647687054,1.5207423580786026,1.0,0.8657769658412834,916,300,0.3275109170305676,4571,30,8.5.6,Voluntarily leaving prior to stoppage,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
525,525,"The labour dispute provisions generally do not apply to an employee who is on leave when the stoppage of work occurs, until such time as the employee would normally have returned to work, had there been no stoppage of work. A cause-and-effect relationship between the loss of employment or being unable to resume it, and the stoppage of work, only exists as of the date the employee was to resume employment.  A disentitlement under the labour dispute provisions would apply as of that date.  This would not be the case where the employee had previously been laid off during a period of leave, for a reason unrelated to the dispute.  This approach will be applied equally in the case of leave for illness, injury or quarantine, pregnancy, caring for a newborn or a child placed for the purposes of adoption, or caring for a critically ill child or other family member.There may be other forms of leave such as, leave for union business, from which a claimant fails to return to work once the reason for the leave ends.   These individuals are considered as unable to resume an employment, and therefore, they would be subject to the labour dispute provisions (EI Act 36(1)). A prolonged leave for the purposes of being engaged in other employment could also fall within this category, unless the claimant clearly meets the condition in section 36(1)b) of the act.Frequently, a claimant continues to receive payment from their employer, which totally or partially compensates for loss of earnings during a period of approved leave. This is especially true for vacation or sick leave, for which the claimant may receive full pay for some or all of the period of leave. Remuneration may also be in the form of special payments to supplement training allowances received from other sources.Where a stoppage of work is attributable to a labour dispute, an employer may stop paying employees on leave. This break in earnings constitutes a form of loss of employment caused by a stoppage of work attributable to a dispute. In such a case, the labour dispute provisions should be considered from the time the payments stop, even if the original period of leave has not ended.  All facts must be carefully reviewed to determine if a claimant meets the conditions to be exempted from a disentitlement.",58.10517420435514,11.746442211055278,12.45797560212912,14.6334338358459,13.883726968174209,10.608140703517584,50.65393634840871,6.4,2.994960553502419,0.6712458219679046,0.5039634511009441,0.0703304114538102,0.8855455560343606,0.8660424030744113,4.680904522613066,4.0,2.703280565351046,26.53333333333333,26.0,7.526545614615571,1.4396984924623115,1.0,0.7502977027564102,398,169,0.4246231155778894,1898,15,8.5.7,On leave at time of stoppage of work,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
526,526,"Whether employees are laid off from regular, seasonal or casual employment, it is very common that they may be recalled by their employer. In some cases, the period or date of recall is more or less determined each year, while for others, recall depends on the employer's requirements at a given time.In such circumstances, entitlement to benefits must be carefully considered when, at the pre-set or anticipated recall date, a stoppage of work caused by a labour dispute prevents reinstatement. A determination must be made as to whether these individuals are unable to resume a previous employment and, if so, whether the labour dispute provisions apply to their cases.Before the specific reference to a claimant unable to resume an employment (EI Act 36(1)) was added in the legislation, most of these cases were considered under loss of employment. Prior to this change, cases involving seasonal workers whose jobs end each year at the end of the active season (FCA A-209-89, CUB 16202; FCA A-1036-92, CUB 21236), of casual employees whose patterns of employment may vary greatly, or an unemployed person who  may or may not be recalled, the adjudication of these cases was  much more difficult (FCA A-801-82, CUB 7464; and FCA A-594-91, CUB 19771).The amendments that were made clarified this situation, and now the entitlement to benefits is considered under the provisions of a claimant unable to resume an employment, which more correctly corresponds to the real situation of these claimants.In this context, it is not enough that the worker, unemployed at the time of the stoppage of work, has only an undefined possibility of working during this stoppage; a moral guarantee, or a simple right to recall may be sufficient in some cases, but not in others (FCA A-044-90, CUB 17664). In fact, to be considered as a claimant unable to resume an employment because of a stoppage of work, the evidence must reasonably conclude that the employee would have been recalled and consequently have had employment, had there been no stoppage of work.Examples of this include: issuance of a recall notice by the employer or posting of a work schedule requiring the employee's services at a specific date; the fact that the previous termination of employment was only temporary for a pre-set period, and that the employee was to return to work at a specific date (FCA A-209-89, CUB 16202) or, finally, that the scale and regularity of employment reasonably indicate that the claimant would have worked during a stoppage of work (CUB 48815). By not following up on such an offer of or opportunity for employment, the employee is clearly unable to resume a previous employment (FCA A-595-00, CUB 45670A). Such situations require that the labour dispute provisions be applied.The same reasoning applies when a claimant who has been laid off by an employer has reached agreement about reinstatement or an eventual return on a specific date or set period, but could not return on the specified date because of a stoppage of work attributable to a labour dispute (FCA A-595-00, CUB 45670A).In the same way, the seasonal worker should not be considered  unable to resume an employment before it can be reasonably concluded that the employer would have reopened at the beginning of the active season, had there not been a stoppage of work  (FCA A-787-81, CUB 6801 and FCA A-1036-92, CUB 21236).The cause-and-effect relationship between being unable to resume employment and the stoppage of work exists as of the date when the employer would have recalled the employee, had there not been this stoppage, provided the stoppage was continuing at that time. Until this time, there can be no disentitlement pursuant to the labour dispute provisions.The same approach cannot be taken in the specific case of an individual who is recalled to work by an employer simply because the employer requires additional services due to the stoppage of work itself, without which there would have been no recall (Digest 8.5.13).  Although the labour dispute provisions would not apply in this scenario, entitlement to benefits would be considered under other provisions of the act and regulations.",31.436533710513928,20.583796322489395,17.58133193835471,24.28473361621877,24.67404997642621,11.707835926449786,72.45157944365866,11.933333333333334,3.7265989056464495,1.101271894577652,0.4408080997460951,0.0457779806738831,0.8926999526364463,0.8936537229097806,4.785007072135785,4.0,2.78694701353366,47.13333333333333,30.0,37.876759218403166,1.507779349363508,1.0,0.8124797580579411,707,244,0.3451202263083451,3481,15,8.5.8,Recall to work,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
527,527,Probation is nothing more than a first step to permanent employment. Its purpose is to evaluate the employee's skills in terms of a firm's present and future needs. Probationary employment is comparable to any other ordinary job (CUB 56673 and CUB 51828). Probationary employment interrupted by a stoppage of work is unquestionably loss of employment attributable to that stoppage (CUB 20493).,49.89395491803282,10.088647540983612,14.191785591663535,15.936065573770492,10.980409836065576,13.201311475409836,48.03688524590164,5.0,2.572794117647059,0.3694390152463045,0.5509135472370766,0.0377663937530043,0.8218669096628824,0.7940822541713715,5.262295081967213,4.0,3.3481173537625555,15.25,15.5,3.031088913245535,1.6721311475409837,1.0,1.019824984589888,61,43,0.7049180327868853,333,4,8.5.9,Probationary employees,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
528,528,"The labour dispute provisions do not make any distinctions between the kind of employment that is subject to the regulations (CUB 65854 and CUB 32940). As long as there is employment that a claimant has lost or is unable to resume because of a stoppage of work due to a labour dispute, the fact that this employment is full or part-time, or on a regular or temporary basis, is of no significance.It is more important to distinguish whether a part-time job has been performed continuously and according to a pre-set pattern, or whether it has been performed only on an irregular basis. While loss of continuing part-time employment constitutes loss of employment (CUB 69780 and CUB 13040), this may not be the case if the part-time job is very irregular. In that case, it must be determined whether the employee was assured of being recalled and would have had employment, had there been no stoppage of work due to the labour dispute (CUB 65854 and CUB 32940; Digest 8.5.8 and Digest 8.5.12).Where applicable, a disentitlement will only be imposed from the date when the claimant would have returned to work, had there been no stoppage of work, in cases where the stoppage continues. It should be noted that from that time, the number of days of disentitlement in a week is to be calculated in proportion to the part-time employment that the claimant has lost or is unable to resume because of a stoppage of work attributable to a labour dispute (EI Act 36(2);   EI Regulation 53; Digest 8.1.6 and  Digest 8.9.0 to 8.9.4).",42.58436813186815,18.623131868131868,16.11434528070225,22.742124542124543,22.43736263736264,9.912527472527469,66.74542124542124,9.666666666666666,4.021000110622752,0.8322257892742374,0.4436057051361035,0.0741714309056034,0.9016456365585328,0.8833647072315216,4.483516483516484,4.0,2.790732848580436,45.5,40.5,17.89553016817328,1.3956043956043955,1.0,0.7920731948887455,273,117,0.4285714285714285,1255,6,8.5.10,Part-time employees,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
529,529,"Termination of employment, whether the employment is permanent or temporary, is still loss of employment subject to the labour dispute provisions, if it is attributable to a stoppage of work caused by a labour dispute at the claimant's place of employment (CUB 65854 and CUB 32940). The same principle applies when a claimant is unable to resume a permanent or temporary employment for the same reasons (EI Act 36).The following are not relevant in determining whether loss of employment is attributable to a stoppage of work:the fact that the job has just started; is short-term or about to end;that the claimant was hired to replace workers on leave or was discharged on the eve of the stoppage of work;that this employment had been accepted during the off-season of a usual occupation;that the employment was obtained through a union travel card;that the claimant was a regular employee of another firm; or,that the claimant was a student whose job was only to last until the return to school.Similarly, whether an employee has already been employed for longer than initially expected is irrelevant if the employment ceases because of a stoppage of work. An employee assigned to a factory where a stoppage of work occurs two days later has still lost employment because of a stoppage of work. The issue is whether the employee was at that job at the time of the stoppage of work, and not how long they were to stay there or whether they should have been elsewhere.It is important to clearly establish the reason for any loss of employment during a stoppage of work, especially in the case of an employee hired on a temporary basis. Even if the loss of employment occurs during a stoppage of work, that may be simply coincidence. Whether or not there was a stoppage of work, this temporary employee would have been laid off for a reason independent of the stoppage of work, for example where a predetermined period of employment has come to an end, in which case the labour dispute provisions are not applicable. The fact that some of the worker's colleagues may have lost or will eventually lose employment due to the stoppage of work, or that the claimant is actually financing the dispute through union dues paid while employed, is not significant Where a person was hired or recalled specifically because of the stoppage of work, the labour dispute provisions will not apply if this person loses or is unable to resume their employment because of the stoppage of work due to the labour dispute (Digest 8.5.13).",34.47459770114945,20.45816091954024,17.251386760058843,24.390804597701152,24.94404597701149,11.311448275862066,75.45977011494253,13.11111111111111,3.3403315792203485,0.5925699435098258,0.5075173549581559,0.0434434663681902,0.9246926233172416,0.9397126606532504,4.714942528735632,4.0,2.7654073606360914,48.333333333333336,34.0,32.80921279830475,1.457471264367816,1.0,0.7700771992809711,435,166,0.3816091954022989,2088,9,8.5.11,Temporary employees,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
530,530,"There are several different types of  casual work situations that may have different impacts on a labour dispute.  What must first be determined is the type of situation in which the casual  employees find themselves. There is the casual employee who only works  from time to time, to replace or assist during specific periods, or those who  are hired for a set schedule on a temporary basis. There are also those on an  on call list who have no set schedule or expectation as to when they will  receive their next call in.Once the status of the casual employee is clarified, the impact of a potential labour dispute on the employee can be determined.  The Commission looks for a distinction between two situations: the person who would undoubtedly have worked at some point during the stoppage of work, had there been no stoppage; and the person who had only a vague possibility of being called during that period (Digest 8.5.8). The labour dispute provisions will only affect the casual employee who would have reasonably expected to work during the labour dispute.",55.94710526315792,12.19887218045113,14.138980108339055,16.330827067669173,13.75784962406015,10.09557894736842,47.66917293233082,5.571428571428571,3.2344082237056044,0.6008203932403429,0.4457865452861563,0.0414859571820709,0.8748869399229685,0.8506807327270508,4.589473684210526,4.0,2.5484556183659866,27.142857142857142,23.0,9.202927661946518,1.4578947368421054,1.0,0.7510103997273373,190,98,0.5157894736842106,879,7,8.5.12,Casual employees,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
531,531,"An impending stoppage of work will not necessarily stop an employer from hiring staff. On the contrary, besides new employees hired to compensate for regular staff turnover, the employer may sometimes increase the work force to increase production, build up inventories, or complete major contracts ahead of schedule. The employer may also attempt to recall some employees who would not have been recalled in other circumstances, in order to mitigate the anticipated or real impact of an eventual stoppage of work.If the stoppage of work does take place, the fact that a claimant has lost an employment or is unable to resume an employment will affect both the employee hired or recalled because of the stoppage of work, and the employee hired or recalled to meet the ongoing needs of the business. The only difference generally being that the latter will be subject to the labour dispute provisions of the act (CUB 10481 and CUB 15967), while the other will not.In reality, it is not always easy to distinguish between one employee and the other, both of whom were temporarily hired or recalled shortly before the stoppage of work occurred. The reason for hiring or recall must be established, to determine if it is a case of a job having been created because of the impending stoppage of work?Some employers readily admit that one or more workers were hired or recalled in direct connection with an anticipated stoppage of work. Others may indicate that the employee was hired or recalled permanently. In the latter case, to help clarify the true reason the employer may be asked why the employee was laid off once work resumed following settlement of the dispute.The passage of time may help to show whether the employee was hired or recalled to perform regular work as a replacement for an individual on sick or maternity leave, for example, or whether it was to perform work that regular employees were refusing to do during a period of dispute. The employee may in fact have obtained a job, not lost it, because of an impending stoppage of work.In most provinces, labour legislation does not prohibit strike breakers replacing employees involved in a stoppage of work. The hiring or recall of workers as strike breakers during a stoppage of work is clearly linked to it; the fact that they have lost employment or are unable to resume an employment, whichever is the case, does not render them subject to the labour dispute provisions. Each case must be considered based on its own set of facts.Even if it is known to the general public that a strike may take place, this does not necessarily mean that every hiring is linked to this fact. Even if the claimant might initially have shown a valid reason for refusing work offered in such a situation, this does not exclude the application of the labour dispute provisions if the claimant eventually accepts genuine employment not related to an impending stoppage of work, and then subsequently loses or is unable to resume that employment because of this stoppage of work.It must be kept in mind that employment is not considered suitable if it arises as a consequence of a stoppage of work attributable to a labour dispute (EI Act 6(4)(a)); and Digest 9.4.4).",49.59486224869694,14.423052866716308,14.470270418902462,17.858057653441126,17.16674928199128,11.169547920433995,59.47335389852144,8.764705882352942,3.381925212241096,0.9819355634796572,0.4680145130920887,0.0501723980759925,0.8867338672280312,0.8815019647280375,4.741410488245931,4.0,2.6495151898193536,32.529411764705884,30.0,14.915911942142325,1.4683544303797469,1.0,0.7507635685499976,553,212,0.3833634719710669,2669,17,8.5.13,Employees hired or recalled by reason of stoppage of work,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes

533,533,"A worker may participate in a labour dispute in many ways. But it is  participation in the actual dispute that must be examined, which is not necessarily  the same thing as participation in the stoppage of work (CUB  55320).It is evident that individuals are participating in a dispute when they  are parties to the dispute being negotiated with the employer, usually through  a representative. It is therefore important to distinguish who is a party to  the dispute and who has a direct interest in it, in order to determine those  who are participating in the dispute. The principle does not change, even if a  person disagrees with the demands of the parties involved in the dispute, or  who have a direct interest in it, or disagrees with the demands of the union  which represents them.Participation may take other forms: rejection of the employer's offers,  recruiting union members, signing a petition, attending meetings, passing a  resolution supporting strikers, voting, engaging in a slow-down, submitting a  conditional resignation, refusal to work, to obey orders or to handle  hot materials, failing to report for work, withdrawing services,  walking out or leaving the job, and participating in or honouring a picket  line.These traditional forms of participation are an expression of support  for the demands of employees who are usually unionized and in dispute with their  employer. They generally characterize the actions and attitudes of workers who  are parties to the dispute and have a direct interest in it. It may also be  that, out of solidarity for these workers, other persons take an active  position in respect of the dispute (Digest  8.2.3).Mere expressions of support for those involved in the labour dispute does  not mean these persons are participating. What must be examined are the facts  and the actions of each individual. A person would not be considered as  participating in the dispute if they continued performing their own duties  during the dispute, or even those usually carried out by workers involved in  the dispute.",37.55194875346263,16.989831024930748,15.774802946060372,19.869362880886428,18.760914127423824,11.020941828254845,66.29390581717452,10.9,3.2456312637905818,0.948428723403901,0.4859179864304088,0.0521269772517508,0.9080098271369934,0.9160586893558502,4.700831024930748,4.0,3.1091366343949285,36.1,35.0,17.85749142516944,1.5678670360110802,1.0,0.956950456516112,361,148,0.4099722991689751,1708,10,8.6.1,Participation defined,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
534,534,"When a union or another association represents one of the parties to the  dispute, in principle all members for whom the union or association is  negotiating are considered to be participants. For example, a resolution  adopted by union leaders in support of a strike by another union binds the  entire membership, thereby making it a participant in the dispute (CUB  67605 and CUB  39832A). The fact that an employee belongs to a union or another association,  does not necessarily mean that the union has the authority to act in the  member's name on all matters. It is the claimant's actions and position in  relation to the dispute that determines their participation in it.It has been held that employees belonging to a union involved in a  dispute are participants if one or more of the following circumstances apply. If they:follow the position  established by the union,attend a union meeting where a  decision is taken to go on strike or to adopt other pressure tactics,fail or refuse to go to work, respect  a picket line, or,join a picket line under  orders from the union.There are many examples of support  being given voluntarily by an employee to the union. It does not need to be on  a large scale; the simple fact of not expressing one's disagreement or  dissociating oneself from their union's demands may amount to participation in  the dispute (Digest  8.6.6  and Digest 8.6.7). The fact  that a person is a party to the dispute is sufficient to conclude that they are  participating (CUB  76451 and Digest  8.6.1).The position of an individual with respect to the dispute has no real  value if a union or another association is duly accredited. Disagreement with  the union or another association, or open disapproval, does not change anything,  unless the group as a whole expresses a common disagreement.Participation is clearly established if the employees have an authorized  representative at the negotiating table. Even union members absent on leave  would be regarded as participating (CUB  21571 and CUB  20347). The fact that a person belongs to a different union or  is not a union member may be an indication that the claimant is personally not  a participant in the dispute, unless they are nevertheless a party to the  dispute (Digest  8.6.1).",44.0294410625346,15.086906474820148,15.091289759661642,18.29839513004981,15.594504703929168,9.476354916067145,55.57812211769047,7.538461538461538,3.333817934644794,0.682690018303175,0.4512610609475204,0.0496706499436175,0.8624717146158218,0.8856844360178168,4.4556354916067145,4.0,3.065014643360799,32.07692307692308,33.0,12.548132183786365,1.539568345323741,1.0,0.9388971568964288,417,162,0.3884892086330935,1868,13,8.6.2,Union or other representation,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
535,535,"Setting up a picket line is certainly one of the most decisive actions  of the existence of a labour dispute. Even if it is usually set up when a  strike occurs, a picket line may also appear when the employer has decided to  reduce operations because of a dispute, or to shut down the establishment until  the dispute is resolved. It goes without saying that honouring a picket line is  no longer relevant when there is a total lock-out, because clearly no duties  can be assigned to those who report for work. However, to those who are a party  to the dispute, it demonstrates obvious proof of participation (FCA  A-270-91, CUB  19037)).Unionized workers traditionally honour picket lines as a form of trade  union solidarity (CUB  63282 and CUB  48786). Honouring a picket line, whether by solidarity or out of  adherence to union principles, or any refusal to cross a peaceful picket line,  is considered participation. The fact that a clause in the collective agreement  may stipulate that employees who refuse to cross a picket line do not violate  the contract, or that another clause provides that, where a picket line is set  up, the collective agreement is deemed to be terminated, does not change this.Thus, workers who refuse to cross a picket line and who fail to report  for work are considered to be on the side of the strikers and supporting their  demands (FCA  A-269-91, CUB 19033). It would  be contrary to the purpose of the statute to consider that they are still  entitled to benefits. On the other hand, when workers who are not involved in a  dispute cross the picket line, this does not mean that they are participating  in the dispute by supporting their employer; they are merely honouring the  contract of service with their employer (Digest  8.6.1).Whether honouring the picket line stems from personal convictions or from  someone else's advice rather than from union policy, is irrelevant.  Participation depends on whether a picket line was honoured and not whether  there were good reasons for doing so. The issue is whether the refusal or  failure to cross the picket line amounts to a voluntary withdrawal of labour (Digest  8.6.6 and Digest  8.6.7).",48.73390094979648,15.540836725463596,13.88584557914918,18.498778833107192,17.662801899592942,9.38199004975124,58.93351424694709,8.181818181818182,3.592442918527062,0.6557802513791968,0.4342970999566663,0.0425586621590928,0.8712293982505799,0.8741854363017612,4.420398009950249,4.0,2.8116463265262714,36.54545454545455,35.0,14.962763699285675,1.4303482587064678,1.0,0.760580020949875,402,171,0.4253731343283582,1788,11,8.6.3,Honouring the picket line,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
536,536,"There may be situations where an employee who is laid off is told that  their recall is cancelled, or is otherwise told not to report for work. The  mere fact that this employee would not have been prepared to cross the picket is  not sufficient to conclude that they are participating (FCA  A-595-00 and CUB  45670A).  This applies  only to the extent that an authorized person notified the employee of the  lay-off, cancellation of the recall to work, or equivalent instructions.Similarly, a group of employees are not considered as participating in a  dispute if there are definite signs that work would not have been available by  reason of the strikers not being at work (CUB 76451 and CUB  56343). But if the employer does have work available, the  question of how long this work will last is irrelevant, as long as there is  some work. Statements made by an employer in a vague and general manner should  be carefully clarified.Sometimes an employer will suspend all operations when informed by a  union of its intention to honour the picket line, or the employer will lay off  employees because they have failed to report for work. In this case, the  employees would be treated as participants. Should there be doubt as to who  took the initiative of interrupting work, the workers' failure to approach the  employer with a view to informing and assuring the employer of their  willingness to continue their work will work against them.An unsupported contention that work would not have been available for  plasterers because of a labourers' strike was not accepted. However, where the  majority of labourers crossed the carpenters' picket line to discover there was  no work, the failure of some of them to do the same was not participation  because they knew that no work was available.At some premises, for example, those where longshore workers are  employed, a special system is used to inform employees where and when work is  available.

Its purpose is to publicize the existence of a strike  and to verbally persuade workers of the merits of the strikers' cause. Strikers  may not deny access to anyone going to work, as every employee has the lawful  and undeniable right to cross a picket line. Legal remedies exist to protect  this right.It is not sufficient to presume that there exists a risk of violence  because of the presence of a picket line.

538,538,"Refusal or failure to cross a picket line constitutes participation if  it amounts to a voluntary withdrawal of labour (CUB  63282 and CUB  48786). Whether this is so in a particular case is usually a  question of fact. It is up to the claimant to show non-participation by  providing rebuttal of voluntary withdrawal (Digest  8.6.7).Withdrawal of labour resulting from a refusal or failure to cross the  picket line is presumed to be voluntary and in support of the strikers, and  therefore amounts to participation. This presumption of fact is based on the  following principle: when workers, or the union or association with their  expressed and implied consent, decide not to resort to the available legal  remedies to exercise their right to cross a picket line, this decision is a  voluntary one.Even if the claimant's union or association decides to honour the picket  line, they are still free to act on their own judgment and consider whether  they prefer to follow or to ignore the decision taken by the union or the  association. This choice, one that workers must frequently make, is purely  voluntary.To enforce union requirements, union rules sometimes provide for fines  or expulsion; in other cases, a non-striker may fear disgrace, the stigma of  being labeled a scab, or the possibility of no longer being able to obtain work  in the worker's trade (FCA A-373-82, CUB  7065 and FCA  A-838-91, CUB 20202). These  reasons do not change the voluntary nature of the withdrawal of labour.",49.8026368613139,14.821514598540144,14.005844860021307,17.933576642335765,16.666532846715327,9.516788321167883,57.60766423357664,8.0,3.169247390737117,0.8562167729676833,0.4434735070865208,0.0504608829432708,0.8571492263248989,0.8682638506094614,4.452554744525547,4.0,2.922279889170897,34.25,36.0,18.08832496390973,1.4452554744525548,1.0,0.8007269327705862,274,132,0.4817518248175182,1234,8,8.6.6,Voluntary withdrawal of labour,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
539,539,"When a claimant does not cross a picket line, there is a strong  presumption that this is at the request of members of the striking union to  rally in their support and to pressure the employer to accept their demands.  This presumption may be rebutted with evidence that the claimant failed to  cross the picket line because of legitimate and reasonable fear of violent  reprisals (FCA  A-373-82, CUB  7065, FCA  A-269-91, CUB  19033, FCA-879-82, CUB 79649 and FCA  A-1036-92, CUB 21236).If they really want to work, non-strikers or their union should take reasonable  action to do so. What is reasonable will depend on the particular situation.The most persuasive evidence of the non-striker's desire to continue  working is a genuine effort to convince the picketers to allow them across the  picket lines. If refused or threatened with violence, the non-striker may call  on police protection to exercise their right to cross the picket line. The  suggestion that a police presence often provokes violence is unacceptable.In cases where pickets are numerous or where there are signs of  violence, a non-striker may be justified in waiting a few days before venturing  across the picket line. Action by strikers must be examined on a daily basis;  they may be peaceful one day and violent the next.However, it is not necessary for a worker to attempt to force their way  through the picket line if the circumstances are such that personal injury or  damage to their property can reasonably be expected to result from such an  attempt.Among the many factors to consider are:whether the picketers were few  in number;whether any attempt was  actually made to cross the picket line;the sincerity of such efforts  and if they were made by only a few or by a group of workers;whether non-strikers  outnumbered strikers;whether the two groups  belonged to affiliated unions;whether an effort was or  should have been made to obtain the picketers' consent;whether the non-striker had no  alternative but to fail to report for work;whether it was practical to  seek police protection; or,whether the strikers were  violent or made threats (Digest  8.6.8).In all cases, a worker must prove by sufficient credible evidence that they  considered a legitimate fear of violence and that this very fear was the reason  for their failure to cross the picket line. If the fear is legitimate, undue  weight should not be given to the fact that a worker did not seek police  protection, since protection cannot easily be afforded 24 hours a day.",52.281928891842526,14.81490280777538,13.991409890343128,18.306629008140884,17.49639641136401,9.733650107991362,58.293570360525,8.076923076923077,3.265794977165803,1.2704673398269544,0.4294917211321566,0.0510611728707849,0.8577404965957006,0.8582523519342596,4.4838012958963285,4.0,2.8298121764592783,35.61538461538461,32.0,19.97128115584769,1.3995680345572354,1.0,0.7275508689910082,463,203,0.4384449244060475,2085,13,8.6.7,Rebuttal of voluntary withdrawal,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
540,540,"Fear is quite clearly a state of mind, something that differs greatly from  one person to another. It is one's appreciation of events, combined with several  other factors. An individual, confronted with the obligation to cross a picket  line, may fear immediate acts of violence or subsequent reprisals by those  involved in the dispute.There is no benchmark or absolute rule for determining whether an  individual is justified in fearing violence. Fear alone, in this context, is  not the determining factor; it becomes legitimate only when it is based on  concrete elements and on facts which show that such constraints exist.  Unsupported assumptions or mere possibilities are not enough. Where no violence  has occurred and where nothing suggests that strikers are determined to resort  to force or violence, fear is regarded as being unjustified. But fear is  legitimate where any attempt to cross a picket line would very likely have led  to acts of violence or reprisals (CUB  63282 and CUB  48786).Indications that may support a legitimate fear of immediate violence  are, of course, serious threats of violence. An imbalance in numbers between  non-strikers and strikers, the fact that they belong to rival unions, or a show  of force may also be indicative of potential violence. Violence that occurred  elsewhere or several years earlier does not alone make fear legitimate.Fear of reprisals against one's person, family or property may also  amount to a legitimate fear of violence. Reprisals here refer to those of a  physically violent nature and do not include moral harassment such as being  treated with contempt and called a scab. The fact that the place of employment  may lend itself to reprisals is not enough.The only possible way a worker may show that their refusal or failure to  cross a picket line does not amount to a voluntary withdrawal of labour is by  demonstrating that their fears are legitimate (FCA  A-373-82, CUB 7065 and FCA  A-269-91, CUB 19033). Unsupported  declarations of fear on behalf of an individual group of organized workers for  the purpose of obtaining benefits must be carefully scrutinized. In principle,  individuals can only testify as to their own fears. Those who speak on behalf  of others should be asked to indicate their sources.A study of the facts is essential to review both sides of the dispute  and determine if the threat of violence is legitimate. The situation may also  change from day to day. The behaviour of picketers must be examined to see  whether there are signs of hostility toward those who wish to report for work,  and to what extent this animosity takes the form of threats, aggressiveness and  violence. Violence is more likely to be present when the dispute is prolonged or  illegal, following the suspension of union leaders, or if union recognition is  at issue. The same is true when the employer resorts to strike breakers. Some  trades and union locals may be known for their regular use of intimidation  tactics.News releases and newspaper articles may be useful in researching and  evaluating the facts surrounding strikers' behaviour (Digest  8.1.10). A police report indicating that no troubles were reported is not  necessarily conclusive because even unreported violence or threats must be  taken into account.Lastly it is not necessary that all members of the same grade or class  feel this legitimate fear of violence. However, it must be felt and shown by  the workers themselves that this fear is the reason they did not attempt to  cross the picket line.",57.39643225039622,10.85217738283903,13.540458340773792,14.909689834729456,11.626272356803264,10.087353407290014,48.36772696400271,5.821428571428571,2.77066372572954,0.6468890064056778,0.4939673306939288,0.0558585475156205,0.8157513009177314,0.8044494310250649,4.625990491283677,4.0,2.856785997870245,22.535714285714285,21.0,10.32847016350279,1.496038034865293,1.0,0.8791835420511299,631,278,0.4405705229793978,2934,28,8.6.8,Legitimate fear of violence,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
541,541,"As we have already seen, participation may take various forms and may  even occur during only part of the period of the stoppage of work. This may be  the case, for example, if a worker who is not a party to the dispute and does  not have a direct interest, honours a picket line for a short period of time or  for even only one day a week. Though such participation is only sporadic, a  worker involved is still a participant in the labour dispute for as long as they  continue to support the strikers (CUB  15334).For as long as the claimant participates, the exempting conditions are  not met (Digest  8.6.1). As for the period of non-participation, the disentitlement will not  apply when the other exempting conditions are also met (Digest  8.7.5 and Digest  8.8.11). The participation of workers of the same grade or class  as the claimant is not an element to consider.However, the above reasoning does not apply to a  person who is laid off and has no direct interest in the labour dispute, even  though that worker may be prepared to report for work at a later date,  notwithstanding the picket line (Digest  8.6.4).",53.97000000000003,14.675,11.855464076750408,16.992592592592594,16.304027777777783,8.013888888888886,52.66666666666666,6.0,3.650693442360109,1.0593396388642482,0.4426078242744909,0.0696422173966365,0.8699628353118897,0.8424016237258911,4.189814814814815,3.0,2.758167662524404,36.0,37.0,11.604596790352806,1.375,1.0,0.7953132390122448,216,103,0.4768518518518518,912,6,8.6.9,Duration of participation,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
542,542,One of the three exempting conditions provided for in the legislation  dealing with labour disputes requires that the claimant not finance the dispute  that is occurring at their place of employment (EI Act 36(4) and Digest  8.1.4). The claimant's entitlement  to benefits is not tied to the fact that there are other workers of the  claimant's grade or class who are financing the dispute.,52.88706521739131,14.45340579710145,,18.43768115942029,17.52695652173913,10.441159420289852,62.03623188405797,9.5,3.346590909090909,0.7215909090909092,0.4502840909090909,0.018465909090909,0.8348782062530518,,4.608695652173913,4.0,2.687692784076204,34.5,34.5,5.5,1.4057971014492754,1.0,0.7674320170941291,69,47,0.6811594202898551,322,2,8.7.0,Financing,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
543,543,"Historically, this expression signified the general fact of providing  financial assistance to one of the parties to the dispute, namely the  employees, in order to help them set up and maintain a stoppage of work  attributable to a labour dispute, resulting in the loss of their employment. This  meant that anyone who provided a monetary contribution to this financial  support, whether voluntarily or not, directly or indirectly, was considered to  be a person who was financing a dispute, pursuant to the labour  dispute provisions of the act. Since then, a Supreme Court's majority judgment has resulted in a more  restrictive interpretation of the word finance. This judgment  better reflects the purpose of the act  as a whole, and prevents innocent victims of the dispute from having their  benefits denied. It was argued that the act  should be interpreted in a way that would be compatible with the values in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms concerning the right of freedom of association (FCA  A-021-77, CUB 4454 and S.C.C  19094, FCA  A-175-84, CUB  8764).  The judgment  maintained the concept that the word financing used in the labour  dispute provisions implied an active connection between the payment and the  dispute, and a direct action on the part of the claimant to provide financial  support to the workers involved in the dispute. Furthermore, according to the  Court, the word financing requires active participation by the  claimant, a free and voluntary contribution to this same cause. The Court found that these elements were not present where the financial  support provided to the workers in the dispute is issued from a fund  established and administered by the international union; in that case, the  person had no choice but to pay union dues, a portion of which was diverted to  that fund, and had no voice in the decision of the international union to  finance the dispute.The Court emphasized some important principles regarding the  union-employee relationship that exists nowadays in Canada. The point was  stressed that, today, unions are neither agent nor mandatory for the employee;  upon this construction, a claimant who pays mandatory union dues could not be  held to finance a strike through such dues.To sum up, the word financing implies a meaningful  connection: a direct action between the contribution and the labour dispute and  requires a free and voluntary participation by the claimant to provide  financial support to the dispute. These two characteristics are essential.",42.56006866064713,16.494181715575618,16.218646115125612,20.45515425131678,19.249326561324303,11.139051918735891,66.03630549285177,10.75,3.4656006826288994,0.9722380899684422,0.453108520971134,0.0524522916113918,0.8884805603460832,0.8887374520301818,4.71783295711061,4.0,3.0167811765781534,36.91666666666666,39.5,18.29598468395608,1.4988713318284423,1.0,0.8614511297266116,443,194,0.437923250564334,2101,12,8.7.1,What does financing a dispute mean,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
544,544,"When the Supreme Court rendered its landmark majority, it responded to  the appeal, and defined the approach that should be followed for all forms of  financing that support employees who are a party to the labour dispute (S.C.C  19094, FCA  A-175-84, CUB  8764).The identification of who is financing a dispute is no  longer dependent on the sole fact of providing financial support to the  employees involved in a dispute. Although this contribution is essential, it would  be premature to conclude that whoever contributes is financing a  dispute.The name given to the financial support is not really important, whether  it is called a strike indemnity, picket pay, lock-out pay, relief money or a  loan of money. What is essential is that such assistance makes its way to the  workers who are a party to the dispute. It would be difficult to determine who contributed and in what manner,  without tracing the financing back to its origin. Therefore, the narrow  definition and the principles expressed by the Supreme Court will be applied to  identify who is financing the dispute.",50.63519230769235,14.270641025641028,14.790194502661404,18.128205128205128,16.29276923076923,10.095999999999997,61.21794871794872,9.333333333333334,3.041513978012833,0.5469147393763137,0.4636179038352951,0.0391277472689354,0.9039545655250548,0.904822200536728,4.558974358974359,4.0,2.877028198637058,32.5,22.5,20.303940504246956,1.4564102564102563,1.0,0.7591475893783162,195,101,0.517948717948718,894,6,8.7.2,Who is financing a dispute,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
545,545,"The activities of a union are mainly financed from the union dues  deducted from the work force that is part of the negotiation units that this  union represents. These may be used to set up a general fund for various uses,  or to set up a specific fund designed to provide financial support to its  members, for example, in case of labour disputes. Such funds may be established  and managed strictly by the local union or, as is more frequently the case, by  a central union of provincial, national or international scope which represents  their common interests. The local unions are affiliated with the central union  and remit a percentage of the union dues deducted from their own members in  order to guarantee various services, such as professional defense and a  relative protection of their income in case of disputes.It would not be possible to pursue union objectives without these  incoming funds and without insuring its continuance through union security by  demanding certain measures such as mandatory payment of union dues, among  others. An employee is generally required to pay dues to the accredited union, obliged  to become a member of the union, may be free to not become a member, or there  may be a certain delay before an employee becomes a member.What this means is that a specific situation where the employees are  obliged to pay union dues into a fund over which they have no voice or control,  is in line with the Supreme Court's conclusion. It was decided that the two  essential elements that characterize who is financing a dispute  were not present in such a situation (Digest  8.7.1 and Digest  8.7.2).This is not an exceptional situation since most strike funds are comprised  of mandatory union dues. Consequently, in most cases, these individuals will  have no difficulty proving that they are not financing a dispute within the  meaning of the exempting clause.This applies regardless of the level of the union's constitution and  administration of a fund that will ultimately support the employees in the  dispute. It is independent of the fact that the contributing employees are  members of the negotiation unit that is a party to the dispute, or that they  are receiving strike indemnity from this fund.A situation may be different from the one studied by the Court, either  because the employees contributed voluntarily to the fund, or had a voice in  the decision to use this fund to support the workers involved in the dispute.  This would be the case when an employee voluntarily contributes, whether  through regular dues or by a special fund-raising campaign, to a fund  constituted and administered at some union level, and having a specific  objective to help the workers involved in a dispute.A second situation of this kind may be where the decision to provide  financial support to these workers is made at a general or special meeting of  union members of the negotiation unit to which an employee belongs. The decision  of the majority of the members to provide such a support will bind this  employee, whether or not they agree with this decision, and even when there is  no other choice than to contribute to the fund that is used for financing. It  can be said generally that a person should accept not only the advantages, but  also any disadvantages that may result from their association with others.In both of these situations there is an active and direct connection  between the payment and the dispute, and a free and voluntary participation  from the employee. These are the two essential characteristics of who is  financing a dispute.A decision by a union executive, to unilaterally provide financial  support to the workers involved in a dispute from a fund made up of mandatory  dues, does not bind the individual employees. This is true, even if  theoretically they have a right to question this decision or can present a  motion of disapproval. It cannot be said that this decision of the union  executive means that the individual employee, who was obliged to contribute to  the fund used for financing and did not have a significant right to decide in  favour or against this support, is financing a dispute.While the majority of the members may vote in favour of financial  support to the workers involved in a dispute, some may officially declare  themselves to be against this position, or as non-unionized or probationary  employees, did not have the democratic right to take a position on the  question.

546,546,"Union dues remitted to a consolidated strike fund established  specifically for the defense of its members undoubtedly constitute the main  source of financing for the payment of strike indemnities. Rarely, however, are  such funds so large as to meet all needs, particularly if the strike is prolonged.  Some unions will resort to other means, call upon other resources or invoke  union solidarity to obtain financial support for the workers involved in the  dispute.Another union organization or local working at the same place of  employment but not involved in the dispute may show their solidarity to the  workers involved in the dispute and provide financial support either in a lump  sum or continuous manner. It will then be necessary to determine whether the  two characteristics judged essential by the Supreme Court are present in this  situation (S.C.C  19094, FCA  A-175-84, CUB  8764; Digest  8.7.1 and Digest  8.7.2). Such would be the case when it is specifically following the  decision of the majority of the local union members, that this financing  support be provided (Digest  8.7.3). It may be that a local union will use its own funds to support a  dispute, by financing certain activities or operations for the benefit of the  strikers, for example by renting premises for their use, printing picket signs,  or even advertising in the media. Such expenditures that do not go specifically  to the workers involved in the dispute and that are usually authorized by the  union executive should not be considered as being financed by each of the  members.In the case of essential services, some employees who are required to  continue to work despite the dispute will agree to remit part of their wages as  a contribution to the cause of the strikers. By such a direct and voluntary  contribution, these employees are without a doubt financing a dispute.Certain members of a local union may also be financing a dispute  on their own. When such persons freely and voluntarily contribute to the  dispute by giving money to the group involved in the dispute, they are  considered to be financing a dispute.",49.81819881889767,14.198274278215225,14.191785591663535,17.4244094488189,16.029409448818896,10.213858267716535,58.784120734908136,8.583333333333334,3.295248352828472,0.6869853653464842,0.4365615754509309,0.0537687509927914,0.8888638290491971,0.8773361802101135,4.582677165354331,4.0,2.892040697235337,31.75,31.0,9.950921230385324,1.4750656167979002,1.0,0.7887215532796233,381,168,0.4409448818897638,1747,12,8.7.4,Other forms of financing,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
547,547,"Union constitutions usually provide for a waiting period at the  beginning of a stoppage of work before benefits may be paid to strikers. Only  after this period and if the stoppage of work still continues may payments be  made from the strike funds. The scale of such payments varies depending on a  person's marital status and the extent of involvement in strike activities in  picketing.Financing does not begin on the day the first payment is made, but on  the effective date from which strike benefit is payable (CUB  52514 and CUB  51828), and continues for as long as assistance is provided to  the workers involved in the dispute. However, the fact that strike indemnities  become payable does not necessarily mean there is someone who is  financing the dispute (Digest  8.7.1, Digest  8.7.3 and Digest  8.7.4).In one case where financial assistance consisted of loans of money made  by the local union, the period of financing was held to be that interval starting  with the first loan and ending with the last loan.Should the labour dispute be financed through a lump sum payment rather  than a weekly strike benefit, financing is considered to start on the day the  payment is made and is deemed to continue until the termination of the stoppage  of work.",54.31952789699574,13.951943592887798,13.925175675911133,17.606131207847948,16.195603923973017,9.50575107296137,56.03249540159411,7.571428571428571,3.230948150193328,0.884306028788721,0.4697941554752276,0.0527461653222824,0.886373390754064,0.8645582556724548,4.454935622317596,4.0,2.6170264750213765,33.285714285714285,29.0,10.22202503999904,1.4034334763948495,1.0,0.7238347249848707,233,117,0.5021459227467812,1036,7,8.7.5,Period of financing,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes

549,549,"The act does not define  what is meant by this expression. There is no clear dividing line between what  is direct and what is indirect, and it is not always easy to distinguish  between the two.Generally an individual is directly interested when the issues in  dispute relate directly to their own job. However, this does not mean there is  no direct interest in a dispute in some situations where the issues under  dispute are not related to the worker's own pay or conditions of work. This situation  may occur during a labour dispute where the employer opposes one of the trade  unions that represent some of the workers on a particular contentious issue.  Workers who are not part of this unit, have nothing to do with and are not part  of the dispute, are nevertheless directly interested if the outcome will  automatically be applied to them, either as part of a collective agreement, or  an established industrial custom or practice. The fact that the employer may  have no obligation to follow this practice does not matter, unless it is known  that the employer will not follow it (Supreme  Court decision 28876; FCA  A-552-00, CUB  48786 and CUB  48815). It is a pure question of facts based on the particular situation of  the case under study to determine if the industrial custom or the relevant  practice is well enough established (FCA  A-741-87, CUB  14021).If an individual is not part of the union and is not involved in the labour  dispute activities, but may indirectly benefit from the final resolution, they  are not considered directly involved.  There  is no direct interest if the only issue is the possibility of revising pay  scales or working conditions once the dispute involving other workers has been  settled, or if an individual would have benefited from a new collective  agreement, had they been a member of the union. The same applies if a worker takes  advantage of a dispute in order to support their own wage demands. Even if the  facts show that a worker did benefit from the solution to the dispute involving  another group of employees, it does not change this line of reasoning. When  employees who are not involved in the dispute seek an end to the strike so that  they may be reinstated, they have only an indirect interest (CUB  15967, CUB  14236).The end results of a dispute should not be the determining factor as to whether  a person was directly interested in a dispute. It is possible that an  individual may be directly interested in the dispute, whether, in the end, the  negotiations, result in an advantage, or if nothing was gained from it. When it  has been determined that the worker has a direct interest, the value of the  benefits at issue is not relevant (CUB  48786 and CUB  48815).The question is not whether a person wins or loses, but if the interest  in the dispute is direct. The possibility of gain clearly strengthens the likelihood  of direct interest in a given case. Direct interest should also be considered  where the claimant shows solidarity with other workers involved in the dispute,  or if the claimant objects to the hiring, continued employment, or dismissal of  other workers.It is quite common for a union to succeed in negotiating an agreement,  including rather sizeable salary increases for a particular industry. The sole  possibility that another union in the same industry demands the same increases  when negotiating its own agreement later on, is not sufficient grounds to  conclude that the second union had a direct interest in the negotiations  undertaken by the first union. The fact that a collective agreement negotiated  with an employer is used as a model for other collective agreements negotiated  elsewhere in the same field of activities, does not mean there is a direct  interest from workers who are not directly governed by this model agreement.It may be difficult for a person to rebut direct interest while being a  member of the union that is negotiating a new collective agreement, and  belonging to one of the group of workers represented by this union. Direct  interest is present when the terms and conditions of the claimant's employment  are included in the negotiations.Once the interest is only incidental to the dispute, it can only be  indirect. Serious consideration must be given to the facts and circumstances,  taking into account the nature of the dispute.Finally, a complete and final severance of the employer-employee  relationship may demonstrate that some workers, namely term employees, are no  longer directly interested in the dispute (FCA  A-594-91, CUB 19771; Digest  8.13.1 and Digest  8.13.2). It should be clearly established that such a severance is  permanent by nature, as opposed to a temporary lay-off (FCA  A-1198-82, CUB 7454). For  example, these employees have no recall rights or promise of a pattern of  employment that guarantees they will be rehired once the dispute is settled.",47.88840301003346,15.150618729096989,14.276558368476785,18.214715719063545,16.986120401337793,9.765975473801555,59.80657748049052,8.73076923076923,3.435955112939439,0.8467691669076741,0.445713091387831,0.046327342277159,0.8961885213851929,0.8852344652016958,4.493868450390189,4.0,2.8331955392705663,34.5,31.5,15.12066848339105,1.4648829431438126,1.0,0.7909351342054908,897,286,0.3188405797101449,4046,26,8.8.1,Definition of the expression directly interested,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
550,550,"More often than not, a dispute between a union and the employer relates  to the ratification of a collective agreement. To decide whether a person has  direct interest, the question to consider is whether that person's employment  will be governed by the agreement in dispute.If it is, the direct interest is obvious. The person's own working  conditions are under negotiation and may be directly changed by the outcome of  the dispute. This is the case when the dispute deals with such matters as  wages, a retroactive increase, hours of work, overtime, job classification,  vacation, seniority, job security, grievance procedure, travel allowances,  union security, elimination of positions, fringe benefits or the duration of  the collective agreement (FCA  A-1198-82, CUB 7454). A dispute over whether a person's job should be included in the  collective agreement gives that person a direct interest. It is not relevant whether  an individual supports or opposes the proposals that have been made, or whether  the worker is on leave at the time of the dispute. A direct interest exists even when only some of the claimant's working  conditions are governed by the collective agreement. Similarly, to be directly  interested, it is not necessary that the person be concerned with the central  issues of the dispute. The issues applicable to the claimant may be of  secondary importance or may have even been settled. It is sufficient that any  working condition related to the employee's own employment be covered under the  collective agreement in dispute.It may happen, in certain exceptional situations, that the workers whose  working conditions are not governed by the collective agreement in dispute are  nevertheless directly interested (Digest  8.8.1). In one case, a claimant whose job was covered by the  collective agreement even though he was a co-owner of the business was held not  to be directly interested, given that he acted more as an employer.When the wages of an employee are partially based on the rate paid to  other employees whose collective agreement is in dispute, the interest is  indirect. The same is true when the employer has no obligation to maintain  relative equality between the employment conditions of workers covered by the  collective agreement and those who are not; however, it may happen, in certain  exceptional situations, that these groups of workers could both be directly  interested  (Digest  8.8.1).A collective agreement is not strictly limited to a single place of  employment. It is possible that employees at different places of employment  working for the same employer are subject to the terms and conditions of a  single collective agreement. This may lead to a single dispute involving  employees at these various places of employment. In such circumstances, an  employer may decide to permanently stop all operations at one of these  premises. This is normally enough to deny those workers at the closed premises,  any possibility of returning to work there, and they consequently have no  further interest in the dispute (Digest  8.11.4). The same conclusion cannot be reached when the workers retain  their seniority rights and could therefore be recalled at other premises  involved in the dispute, and which will undoubtedly reopen once the dispute is settled.",50.43818607705779,13.316829246935203,14.191785591663535,16.673940455341505,15.405157618213655,11.327495621716285,60.42390542907181,9.1,3.2558082931658,0.7483753095036763,0.4746079251202603,0.0611096216305068,0.8875346058293393,0.8760035766495599,4.78984238178634,4.0,2.952270961149428,28.55,25.0,13.485084352720971,1.5061295971978983,1.0,0.7948262500653885,571,204,0.3572679509632224,2763,20,8.8.2,Ratification of collective agreement,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes

This single dispute may take place at one or several different places of  employment (Digest  8.5.4).Whether one or several disputes are underway, if the worker's employment  is governed by one of the collective agreements in dispute, then the interest  is direct (CUB  15967, CUB  14236).Where the stoppage of work is due to a single isolated dispute, that  particular dispute must be identified.

552,552,"Having input into legislation to determine working conditions in some  sectors, is particularly common in Quebec. The Collective Agreement Decrees  Act allows associations of workers or employers in a given  sector with negotiated collective agreements, to ask the Minister of Labour to  extend some conditions included in these agreements, to all employees in the  designated sector of a specific region, or throughout the province.Thousands of workers are subject to such decrees, and joint committees  composed of union and management representatives of the designated sectors have  the responsibility for applying and enforcing these decrees. There are several  throughout Quebec, in five major areas of activity; namely: hairdressing,  garages, industries, services and garment.The Quebec construction industry has its own decree, put in place by the  government following each round of negotiations (pursuant to the Labour Relations in the Construction  Industry Act), which applies the  collective agreement reached between the major employer and employee  associations, to the industry as a whole. Upon the Minister of Labour's  recommendation, the government may also prolong, change or repeal a decree,  without the consent of the parties, if it is in the public interest and appears  to be the only way to avoid a dispute. It should be added that unionization is  mandatory in this industry.Obviously all workers in such a sector are directly involved in a  dispute when working conditions, once negotiated, are to be subject to a  general decree (FCA  A-511-97, CUB  37886). But the mere possibility of this is not sufficient (FCA  A-825-95, CUB  30448).The direct interest need not be immediate. The working conditions may be  affected only from a set date in the future (CUB  55320 and CUB  52514), and even this date could be a contentious issue.",40.36479746835445,15.47956962025317,15.6451,18.71594936708861,17.219462025316453,11.788734177215185,61.97974683544304,9.6,3.4210591994875728,0.8371437200419267,0.4348538713420746,0.0548821103565502,0.8776235183080038,0.8584173992276192,4.85126582278481,4.0,3.153263074649155,31.6,31.5,13.410443691392167,1.5886075949367089,1.0,0.8868215669388552,316,157,0.4968354430379746,1551,10,8.8.4,Working conditions governed by legislation,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
553,553,"The fact that a collective agreement is in force does not mean there  cannot be any dispute in the business or firm. The interpretation or  application of a specific clause in the collective agreement may be the source  of a dispute.

561,561,"The employment at issue is part-time employment that the claimant has  lost or is unable to resume for reasons related to a labour dispute (EI Act 36(1)). Generally,  part-time employment means employment that is engaged in other than  continuously full-time. Part-time employment may include a period of work at  full-time as, for example, a person who works full-time one week every two  weeks.The pattern of employment of a person may, at a certain time, change,  such that, instead of full-time employment, the employment becomes part-time,  or vice versa. The issue to be decided when considering if it is full-time or part-time  employment that a claimant has lost or is unable to resume, is their pattern of  employment at the time it was lost or could not be resumed because of a  stoppage of work.The claimant's pattern of employment may be different at the time they  are unable to resume a previous employment, than what it had been before. It  may be that the claimant is unable to resume part-time employment because of  the stoppage of work, but they had a full-time job for the same employer in the  past.

562,562,"For the claimant who has lost or is unable to resume part-time  employment because of a stoppage of work due to a labour dispute, the number of  days of disentitlement in a week will be in accordance with the regulation as  follows (EI  Regulation 52(2)):. . . the number of days of disentitlement of the claimant in a week  is, for the percentage that is set out in column I of the table to this  subsection and that is the ratio between the claimant's average weekly  insurable earnings in that part-time employment and the weekly insurable  earnings as determined under section 14 of the act, the  corresponding number of days of disentitlement set out in column II of that  table ...Column 1: PercentageColumn 2: Number of Days of Disentitlementmore than 0 but not more than 100more than 10 but not more than 301more than 30 but not more than 502more than 50 but not more than 703more than 70 but not more than 904more than 905The number of days of disentitlement in a week is a function of the  claimant's average weekly earnings from that part-time employment as a  percentage of the weekly insurable earnings in the claimant's calculation  period. Thus, depending on whether the percentage of the normal weekly earnings  is small or large, the days of disentitlement in a week will vary from zero to  five.The objective here is to disentitle a claimant, or in other words reduce  the weekly benefits, only to the same extent as the part-time employment that has  been lost or cannot be resumed due to the stoppage of work. This introduces the  notion of equity that had not been part of the prior provisions (Digest  8.9.0).The percentage of part time earnings in comparison to normal earnings  represents what was intended to be measured.  That is, the relative importance of the part-time employment that a claimant  has lost or is unable to resume due to a labour dispute, to the employment(s)  used to establish the weekly rate of benefit (Digest  8.9.3 and Digest  8.9.4). Once the percentage of the part-time earnings to the full-time  earnings is known, the table in EI  Regulation 52(2) is used to determine the number of days of disentitlement in  a week.The disentitlement must be for a precise number of days in a week, and continues  for each week for as long as the disentitlement applies (is not ended or  suspended) (Digest  8.1.7 and Digest  8.1.9); the days where the disentitlement may apply are not  predetermined and may not be the same from week to week. The fact that the start or end of a period of disentitlement occurs in  the middle of a week does not change anything in respect of the number of days  of disentitlement that will apply in a week of unemployment. What must be  ensured is that the number of days of disentitlement applied to either the  first or the last week of the stoppage of work, does not exceed the number of  days that are affected by the stoppage of work. If, for example, the prescribed  disentitlement is to be for three days a week and the end of the period of  disentitlement occurs on a Monday; the disentitlement would only apply for one day  in that week.Finally, because the claimant's weekly insurable earnings in the calculation  period could change from one benefit period to the next, the calculation of the  number of days of disentitlement in a week could equally change from one  benefit period to the next. Thus, even where the same part-time employment and  the same stoppage of work straddles two benefit periods, the exact number of  days of disentitlement in a week for this claimant may be different from one  benefit period to the next.",38.55304985337244,19.98393799748639,15.903189008614271,23.59128613322162,23.10693757855048,8.784985337243398,66.8961038961039,8.857142857142858,4.08417260594376,0.8359051397399112,0.4816993297326032,0.0425435322148668,0.9213217130074134,0.919446418682734,4.284457478005865,4.0,2.9613381816173057,48.71428571428572,44.0,15.433861526936578,1.404692082111437,1.0,0.8900764286742956,682,184,0.2697947214076246,2944,14,8.9.2,Disentitlement proportional to part-time employment,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
563,563,"The regulations introduce the concept of average weekly earnings from a  part-time employment that the claimant has lost or is unable to resume because  of a stoppage of work due to a labour dispute.At the outset it must be shown that at the moment the part-time  employment was lost or could not be resumed, the claimant had worked or would  have worked in this employment according to a definite pattern. In this context  it is logical that the determination of the average weekly earnings from the part-time  employment would be determined based on this pattern of employment.In most cases the information on the record of employment (ROE) will be  sufficient to determine the pattern of employment. Where the information is not  available, the information could be obtained from the claimant. The employer must  be contacted when the information obtained is insufficient, not credible or contradicts  information contained on the ROE.Numerous scenarios may exist in the establishment of the claimant's  pattern of employment at the moment when they lost part-time employment. The  first scenario could be the regularity of the pattern of the part-time  employment. For example, the claimant who works one day every two weeks and  earns $180 would have average weekly earnings of $90 in this case.In another case it could be an irregular pattern of part-time employment,  such as the claimant who works on an on-call basis with varying earnings and at  irregular intervals. In this case the approach taken should be reasonable and take  into consideration the realities of this part-time employment. In this sense a  window of twenty consecutive weeks preceding the moment when the claimant lost  the part-time employment constitutes a sufficiently long period to reflect the  recent reality of this part-time employment and permit a satisfactory  determination of the average weekly earnings.The actual earnings from the part-time employment during the 20-week window  will be divided by the number of weeks worked during that period, to determine the  average weekly earnings from the part-time employment. The actual earnings in a  given week could be minimal or nil, if the claimant had not worked. It could also  surpass the maximum insurable earnings, if they had worked full-time.If the irregular pattern of part-time employment started in a week  within the preceding twenty weeks, then the calculation will only go back to that  week and consequently will cover a period of less than twenty weeks. Thus, for  example, within a window of twenty consecutive weeks, it is only at the tenth  week that the claimant's employment, which was on a regular part-time or a  full-time basis, becomes irregular part-time employment. For the purposes of  the calculation, only the weeks from where the employment became irregular  part-time, would be considered; that is, from the tenth week.The fact that the pattern of employment had only recently become  part-time when the claimant lost that employment will not change this approach.  It is the pattern that the claimant would have normally continued to work, had  it not been for the stoppage of work. It is from this pattern of employment,  regular or irregular, that the average weekly earnings will be determined, even  when that pattern of work just recently started.This will not be the case however when the recent pattern of employment  would only have been for a short period, or was directly related to the anticipated  stoppage of work. For example, a claimant whose regular pattern of employment  of two days a week for $150 was increased to four days a week because of the  looming stoppage of work. In that case we would determine the average weekly  earnings based on the pattern of employment which previously existed, without  taking into consideration the most recent pattern. This would result  in average weekly earnings of $150.The approaches developed to this point would equally apply to claimants  who are unable to resume a previous employment. The pattern of work in the  future, had there not been a stoppage of work, would in most cases be the same  as the past employment held with this same employer.

566,566,"The suspension of the disentitlement is only possible during a period for which the claimant proves they are otherwise entitled to benefits for one of the following reasons:pregnancy,caring for a new-born or a child placed for the purposes of adoption,providing care or support to a family member with a serious medical condition,illness, injury, or quarantine, or,attending a course or employment activity to which the claimant was referred by a designated authority of the Commission (EI Act 12(3) and EI Act 25).It is important to know the reasons why the claimant is requesting benefits during a period of disentitlement due to a labour dispute. Suspension of the disentitlement is not considered if the reason is not one of those mentioned above.The first step is to determine whether the claimant is otherwise entitled to benefits for the reasons stated, despite the work stoppage. The claimant must first meet the qualifying conditions for the type of benefits being requested, such as having accumulated the required number of hours of insurable employment, and having any documents to support their declarations for the period during which benefits are requested. A minor attached claimant (has less than 600 hours in their qualifying period), for example, cannot receive maternity (EI Act 22(1)), parental (EI Act 23(1)), compassionate care (EI Act 23.1(1)) or family caregiver (child and adult) benefits (EI Act 23.2(1) and EI Act 23.3(1)). The same would apply to a claimant who has already received the maximum benefits payable for sickness (EI Act 12(3)) and subsequently requests additional weeks of these benefits, during the course of the stoppage of work.The disentitlement imposed as a result of a labour dispute would not be suspended in the case of a person who, during the work stoppage, is entitled to receive benefits from the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan. As a general rule, this person cannot prove that they are otherwise entitled to EI maternity or parental benefits (EI Regulation 76.09).A claimant may provide several reasons during the benefit period, that would allow for the suspension of the disentitlement. For example, sickness benefits followed by maternity benefits followed by parental benefits. Each of these types of benefits must be examined separately with respect to their own conditions of entitlement.The fact that a person would otherwise be entitled to benefits for the reasons mentioned does not guarantee that the disentitlement will be suspended. A supplementary condition provided in the legislative text must also be met, and is dealt with in the following heading.",35.85625000000002,17.015183215130026,17.600137713308605,21.38132387706856,20.145851063829788,13.260709219858152,67.63770685579196,11.416666666666666,3.226108894652517,0.9812432886945046,0.4690374959495219,0.0717876272342048,0.7774438993497328,0.738239386677742,5.085106382978723,4.0,2.9290007373935447,35.25,30.0,24.722206616724165,1.5981087470449171,1.0,0.9169773644927376,423,176,0.4160756501182033,2209,12,8.10.1,Otherwise entitled to benefits,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
567,567,"A period of disentitlement cannot be suspended simply because there is a period during which a claimant could otherwise be entitled to other types of benefits (Digest 8.10.1). Pursuant to EI Act 36(3), the claimant must also meet a supplementary condition.The claimant must prove that, before the work stoppage, they hadanticipated being absent from their employment because of the reason for which they are requesting benefits, andbegun making arrangements in relation to the absence.The supplementary condition does not come into play when there is no period during which the claimant could otherwise be entitled to benefits.Essentially, this supplementary condition disregards the stoppage of work and permits the claimant to receive another type of benefits when the absence was anticipated and arrangements for the leave had begun before the stoppage of work. This prevents access to benefits by those who may attempt to avoid disentitlement, during the course of the stoppage of work.It is necessary to determine at what precise moment the stoppage of work occurred in order to accurately determine if the absence was anticipated and if arrangements for that absence had begun before the stoppage of work. This will be more complicated if at the claimant's place of employment there were several stoppages of work due to the same labour dispute and they were of varying duration. In this case it will be considered to be the stoppage of work which is tied to the disentitlement that the claimant is requesting be suspended.This supplementary condition imposes two separate obligations on the claimant. Not only must there be proof that the absence from employment, for one of the reasons mentioned in the legislation, was anticipated, but also that arrangements for this absence had begun before the stoppage of work occurred. It is not necessary that the exact period of absence had been fixed or known before the start of the stoppage of work. An anticipated absence for reasons other than those mentioned, or which was not accompanied by concrete arrangements to this effect, will not fulfill this condition. The same is true when the arrangements were not in relation to the anticipated absence or only started during the course of the stoppage of work.A statement from the claimant that arrangements were started is not sufficient to avoid a disentitlement. The claimant must substantiate the statements with documents, certificates and/or any other supporting information. For example, the claimant may show that they advised the employer before the stoppage of work, of the anticipated absence, or had at that time requested authorization for the absence. Such arrangements by themselves may not demonstrate that the claimant fulfills the supplementary condition on all points.In fact, for the person who anticipates an absence from employment, these arrangements with the employer are, more often than not, the last thing the person does. Other arrangements, depending on the reasons for the absence from work, must be made and it is these arrangements that the claimant must furnish to the Commission as proof that they began before the stoppage of work. There is no requirement that the arrangements be finalized before the stoppage of work. It must also be realized that a person may have begun making arrangements without saying a word to the employer. The fact that a claimant has absented themselves from employment with or without the employer's authorization, or even, that the arrangements were made without the knowledge of the employer, does not change the fact that arrangements had begun.It rests with the Commission to determine what constitutes acceptable proof that the claimant fulfills the supplementary condition",50.81875940099837,12.143337104825289,14.381905143607526,16.071906821963392,14.884509151414314,13.2981697171381,53.823693843594015,7.16,3.0253899775116917,0.9984473539415868,0.4836325739151653,0.0759681010974962,0.8447800787786642,0.8727389042792113,5.158069883527454,4.0,3.0163126548356938,24.04,25.0,9.488856622375533,1.5557404326123128,1.0,0.8958981174131939,601,189,0.3144758735440932,3154,25,8.10.2,Supplementary condition,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
568,568,"More than a simple statement is needed from the claimant, indicating that their absence from employment was anticipated and that arrangements to this effect had begun before the stoppage of work. It is essential that the claimant provide the relevant information, explanations and, when required, documents in support of such a statement, so that it could reasonably be concluded that they fulfilled the supplementary condition.In the case of pregnancy, acceptable proof is the claimant's declaration as to her pregnancy and the actual or expected date of the child's birth, submitted with the claim for benefits, as it establishes that the claimant was pregnant before the stoppage of work.For those who are caring for a newborn child, acceptable proof may be a confirmation from the employer that a leave for such an absence had been anticipated and requested before the stoppage of work. A person could also demonstrate by their work history that the absence was anticipated and planned in order to take care of a newborn child, if this had been the case for an earlier birth. Moreover, a statement can also be accepted if it demonstrates that arrangements were in place before the stoppage of work, for a claimant to take a leave for a certain period of time, to care for the newborn child.A statement from a medical practitioner could also establish that it was known, before the start of the stoppage of work, that a newborn child's state of health would eventually require one of the parents to be absent from work.In the case of compassionate care leave, the claimant will be required to submit a medical certificate for compassionate care benefits attesting that a family member has a serious medical condition with a significant risk of death within 26 weeks and requires the care or support of one or more family members. Acceptable proof may be confirmation from the employer that the arrangements for the absence from work had begun before the stoppage of work.Claimants requesting family caregiver benefits are required to submit a medical certificate signed by a medical professional. An attestation by the medical professional is required, indicating that the family member is critically ill or injured and requires the care or support of a family member.  The medical must also indicate the period during which the family member  is expected to require care or support.With respect to illness, injury or quarantine, the claimant will be required to submit a medical certificate attesting that the absence was anticipated before the start of the stoppage of work and that some arrangements in that respect had begun before the stoppage of work. This refers strictly to an illness or injury for which an absence had been anticipated, be it for treatment, surgery or a stay in a detoxification centre, and in respect of which arrangements had begun before the start of the stoppage of work.What is not included in this category is an illness or injury that was diagnosed before the stoppage of work, but before the start of the stoppage of work, it had not been anticipated that there would eventually be an absence from work. The same would apply in the case of an illness or injury which occurred before the start of the stoppage of work, but the claimant had not made any arrangements to be absent from employment until after the start of the stoppage.It would however, be acceptable where the illness is related to a chronic or degenerative condition that results in episodic absences from employment, whose existence was known before the start of the stoppage of work.For those attending a course or employment activity, it need only be confirmed by the designating authority that there was in fact a referral made to attend a course or employment activity, and that arrangements for participation had begun before the stoppage of work.Finally, a vague possibility of an absence, without further specifics is not sufficient to arrive at the conclusion that the absence was anticipated. It is necessary that the elements of anticipation, planning and organization exist before the start of the stoppage of work in order for an absence to be considered as anticipated before the stoppage. The situation here is one where the claimant had begun making arrangements before the start of stoppage of work and the absence from employment had been one of the anticipated outcomes.",42.43085365853662,16.07154084397987,15.4700424275458,19.368795973674025,19.161713124274108,12.096422764227643,62.920634920634924,9.761904761904765,3.221006836279978,0.4668621768866911,0.4917184409978582,0.0666485875080837,0.9381681650876998,0.9336346576088352,4.887533875338754,4.0,2.882915123496713,35.142857142857146,35.0,8.940468264532662,1.521680216802168,1.0,0.866536197599123,738,214,0.2899728997289973,3664,21,8.10.3,Acceptable proof,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
569,569,"The suspension of a disentitlement will permit the payment of the type of benefits to which the claimant proves entitlement, regardless of the labour dispute in progress. The fact that there was participation, financing or direct interest will not have any bearing during the period where the claimant fulfills the legislative requirements relating to the suspension of the disentitlement (EI Act 36(3); Digest 8.10.1 and Digest 8.10.2).The disentitlement will be suspended for as long as the conditions are met. Once the claimant is no longer otherwise entitled to another type of benefits during the benefit period, the disentitlement due to the labour dispute will automatically be re-imposed. Furthermore, as long as the legislative requirements are met, it is possible that there could be more than one period where the disentitlement is suspended during the course of the same labour dispute or benefit period.The fact that a labour dispute disentitlement has been suspended will not prevent the labour dispute and the stoppage of work to follow their course, that a resolution between the two parties could occur, or even that the claimant, at a certain time, could meet the conditions of non-application (EI Act 36(4) and Digest 8.1.4). When the situation permits the termination of the disentitlement, the question of suspension becomes irrelevant.The suspension of a disentitlement does not mean that the claimant will immediately receive the benefits claimed. During the period of suspension, a claimant may be required to serve the waiting period, another disentitlement, an allocation of earnings, or even a disqualification for benefits otherwise payable.  No benefits can be paid until any or all of these have been served.",36.85398550724639,15.737391304347828,16.32212239822248,19.223188405797103,18.426050724637683,13.849130434782609,60.73913043478261,9.22222222222222,3.160589720231503,0.6823166320353635,0.4682872475906977,0.0686900037894314,0.9013554006814956,0.8854954157556806,5.206521739130435,4.0,3.225368342558658,30.666666666666668,29.0,14.344956527566676,1.641304347826087,1.0,1.072531088760558,276,125,0.4528985507246377,1467,9,8.10.4,Period suspended,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
570,570,"The termination of a stoppage of work is not an isolated event which suddenly occurs by chance. Rather, this event is collectively resolved and brings the stoppage of work to an end (Digest 8.4.0 to 8.4.3).There are regulations in place prescribing the circumstances that must exist in order for the  stoppage of work to be considered ended. EI Regulation 53(1) states:\u2026 a stoppage of work at a factory, workshop or other premises is terminated whenthe work-force at the factory, workshop or other premises attains at least 85 per cent of its normal level; andthe level of activity in respect of the production of goods or services at the factory, workshop or other premises attains at least 85 per cent of its normal level.The termination of the stoppage of work has occurred when two indicators have been met; that is, the number of the work force, and the activities related to the production of goods and services have returned to 85% of normal levels.This 85% minimum is a rigid benchmark between the continuation of the stoppage of work and the end of the stoppage, which occurs when this minimum is attained. The 85% minimum must be obtained in both indicators. Without it, it cannot be concluded that the stoppage of work has terminated. For example, if the work force equals or surpasses the normal level by 85%, but not the activities related to the production of goods and services, the stoppage of work has not ended (Digest 8.4.2). Regarding the production of goods and services, a minimum of 85% must be met in both quantity and quality.The determination that the stoppage of work has ended is one of the two factors that permits the termination of the disentitlement (EI Act 36(1)). The question is whether the stoppage of work has come to an end with regard to the business as a whole, or, if the labour dispute was more limited in its impact, with regard simply to those operations or group of workers affected by the dispute (Digest 8.4.1).Termination of the stoppage of work does not necessarily mean that the dispute has come to an end.  Just like the fact that the dispute may be settled does not mean the stoppage of work is immediately terminated. It would be quite unusual for these two events to occur at the same time (Digest 8.11.2).Although a sole dispute could stop activities at several places of employment, the determination of when the stoppage of work terminates must be considered separately for each of these locations. The termination of the stoppage of work could therefore occur at different dates because of the actual situation existing at each of these places.Finally, it must be remembered that the 85% minimum must be calculated on the basis of what constitutes the normal level of the work force and the activities related to the production of goods and services. In many cases it is not easy to determine the normal level which corresponds to each of these indicators.",54.53017566568049,13.525521449704144,13.328392162939544,16.698668639053256,16.430909763313615,10.752268244575935,56.53957100591716,7.875,3.1685819677870866,0.9604763961937768,0.4971781906259837,0.0500984346036608,0.8622146288553874,0.8356457948684692,4.674556213017752,4.0,2.835844730516375,31.6875,26.5,16.679773492167094,1.4201183431952662,1.0,0.7788055296773592,507,178,0.3510848126232742,2419,16,8.11.0,Termination of the stoppage of work,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
571,571,"The regulation provides that the stoppage of work terminates when the work force and the activities related to the production of goods and services represent at least 85% of their normal level (EI Regulation 53).What constitutes the normal situation for these two indicators corresponds to the situation which would normally have existed, had it not been for the stoppage of work. Generally, the number of employees and the level of activities that existed before the stoppage of work is a good indicator of what the normal situation would have been. The level of production that had been attained due to overtime operations could also qualify as being normal. The normal situation is not, however, when the work force and the level of activities were attained because of exceptional or temporary measures taken by the employer, to lessen the effects of the labour dispute situation. The normal situation would be determined after discounting these measures (Digest 8.11.6).The normal situation evolves from one moment to another and could result from the differing number of employees and level of activities during this time. It is necessary to consider fluctuations in production, if these normally occur during the course of the year. Contracts that the business would have normally obtained or achieved, if not for the stoppage of work and the dispute, are also factors to consider.The situation as it existed before the stoppage of work could also be attributed to factors related to the labour dispute, and the potential stoppage of work. The situation would be considered normal if changes to the work force or the level of activities prior to the stoppage of work, whether reduced or increased, can be explained by factors not relevant to the dispute.  These factors could include the economic climate, competition reduced or increased by competitors, or, active or seasonal shutdowns.However, when factors are related to the dispute and potential stoppage of work and are causing a reduction or increase in the work force or level of activities, it is not considered when determining the normal situation. The normal situation would correspond to one that would normally have existed in the absence of these factors.Sometimes circumstances could occur during the course of the stoppage of work, or at the resumption of activities, and have a bearing on the normal situation (Digest 8.11.2 to 8.11.5). Some of these may be related to the dispute and the stoppage of work, while others may not; some may permanently modify the normal situation, and others, only temporarily.",48.88071428571432,13.89428571428572,14.03260196037952,16.857142857142858,17.411571428571428,12.977333333333329,61.19047619047619,9.357142857142858,3.5486795326697256,0.826722207620439,0.4827074545600103,0.0520026279243144,0.9305797815322876,0.9257884671290716,5.061904761904762,4.0,2.730075210977964,30.0,29.0,11.205865810879075,1.5071428571428571,1.0,0.7668404121374113,420,145,0.3452380952380952,2166,14,8.11.1,Normal situation,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
572,572,"There is no absolute rule that says the settlement of the dispute is conditional on the resumption of activities. The parties could agree to resume activities even if there is no immediate apparent solution to the dispute or they could be prevented from resuming activities where no settlement has been reached. This does not mean that the number of employees at work and the activities related to the production of goods and services will instantly attain the levels equivalent to the normal situation (Digest 8.11.1).In the vast majority of cases, the resumption of work is a gradual process, governed by a back-to-work agreement and the business' requirements. It is quite likely that only those workers who are needed to perform the preliminary tasks in preparation for the resumption of normal business activities, will initially be recalled, for example, to start up the machinery or repair equipment. This situation may also apply to a small group of employees who may be recalled one or more weeks before the majority of the workers affected by the labour dispute. Whatever the case may be, this does not by itself result in the termination of the disentitlement for those recalled, unless, when resuming employment, the claimant effectively holds the same job that was held before the stoppage of work occurred (Digest 8.12.0).The settlement of the dispute has little bearing on the disentitlement. It is the termination of the stoppage of work which is the deciding factor and which permits the termination of the disentitlement (EI Regulation 53; FCA A-1063-87; CUB 69099C). The question is not whether the claimant is still involved in the dispute, but whether the claimant continues to be involved in a stoppage of work attributable to that dispute.Even when a labour dispute has been settled, it likely leaves an impact which continues to affect the normal course of the activities of a business for some time. This may be the case, regardless of the impact of other factors unrelated to the dispute, which can also delay the resumption of activities. The causal relationship between the dispute that has been settled, and the stoppage of work that continues, should not be based merely on speculation. The period of time between the settlement of the dispute and the termination of the stoppage of work must be a natural consequence of the dispute. If it is not, facts must be obtained before concluding that there is a causal relationship between the past dispute and the continuing stoppage of work.It may also happen, once the dispute is settled, that another unrelated cause arises and becomes solely responsible for prolonging the duration of the stoppage of work. It then becomes necessary to determine the point at which the stoppage ceases to be directly attributable to the dispute and when another stage begins; that is, due to another cause.Obviously, in this context, it is in the interest of claimants and unions to minimize the impact of the conflict in explaining the delay in resuming the course of normal activities, or to introduce other causes that are minimally or entirely unrelated to the dispute (Digest 8.4.3). Regardless of this, each of the parties must be given the opportunity to state their case and be assessed fairly and objectively, in order to determine whether the resumption was delayed or prevented in some way, as a result of the dispute.Once the dispute is settled, it is often difficult, depending on the sector involved, to resume normal activities as if nothing had happened, to secure new orders, or to recover lost clients. Such considerations may be sufficient to show relative continuity in the relationship between the dispute and the stoppage of work.The continuing stoppage is obviously due to the dispute if it results from damages caused by the dispute or closure of the premises, unless the employer does not take immediate steps to put the machinery in working order. A delay due to the employer's intentions to restructure the staff or to proceed with renovations, is not attributable to the dispute.Other circumstances could also prevent the attainment of the 85% minimum. A regulatory provision specifies at what time the stoppage of work terminates in those circumstances (EI Regulation 53(2); and Digest 8.11.3).",46.934222290263335,14.381806491120638,15.27690151875764,18.206981016533987,17.28279669320269,12.301577464788728,60.72872014696877,9.217391304347826,3.341089691445568,0.8662385100522503,0.4767977687264793,0.056582699335077,0.8826155987652865,0.8902018410818917,4.94225352112676,4.0,2.866669165554533,30.869565217391305,30.0,10.791721254603042,1.519718309859155,1.0,0.8468865461554549,710,264,0.3718309859154929,3584,23,8.11.2,Settlement of dispute resumption of activities,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
573,573,"A business where a stoppage of work due to a labour dispute occurred may be impacted by many circumstances when the dispute is resolved. For the most part, these circumstances are related to the dispute and the stoppage of work. Other circumstances, specific to the business or a sector of the economy, that are unrelated to the dispute and the stoppage of work, could also occur, which would have an impact on the work force and business activities.The effects of these circumstances on the number of workers and the level of activities could be minimal or significant, temporary or long term, and in the latter case, may be felt beyond the settlement of the dispute and the subsequent resumption of activities (Digest 8.11.2).Whatever the situation, generally, the fact that these circumstances occur during the course of a stoppage of work and impact the normal situation of a business, does not change the relationship between the cause and effect linking the initial stoppage of work to the dispute (FCA A-181-83, CUB 7842; and FCA A-270-91, CUB 19037).Among these circumstances there are some which will always be considered in light of the regulation dealing with when the stoppage of work terminates. Here is an extract of EI Regulation 53(2): Where, in respect of a stoppage of work, an occurrence prevents the attainment of at least 85 per cent of the normal level of the work-force or activity in respect of the production of goods or services at a factory, workshop or other premises, the stoppage of work terminates:if the occurrence is a discontinuance of business, a permanent restructuring of activity or an act of God, when the level of the work-force or of the activity attains at least 85 per cent of that normal level, with the normal level adjusted by taking that occurrence into account; andif the occurrence is a change in economic or market conditions or in technology, when  there is a resumption of activity at the factory, workshop or other premises, andthe level of the work-force and of the activity attains at least 85 percent of that normal level as adjusted by taking that occurrence into account.These prescribed circumstances share the common fact that they happen during the course of the labour dispute and they prevent the attainment of a minimum of 85% of the normal level. Moreover, it must be noted that these circumstances modify, at least for an indefinite period, the normal situation of the business or the specific operation of the business affected by the stoppage of work. It is logical, therefore, to adjust what would constitute the normal situation for the two indicators. It is then against the adjusted level that a determination would be made as to whether the 85% minimum has been attained.These circumstances do not have to have a great impact on the two indicators. It is sufficient that they prevent the attainment of 85%. For example, it is relevant if a circumstance results in reducing the work force or activities by 10%, which could be just the amount that is needed to attain a minimum of 85% of the normal level.Finally it is important to keep in mind that any exceptional or temporary measures taken by the employer for the purpose of offsetting the effects of the stoppage of work must not be taken into consideration (EI Regulation 53(2); and Digest 8.11.6).",37.937237762237785,18.89867132867133,16.09822454788146,22.285314685314688,22.810751748251747,11.2927972027972,69.52447552447552,11.23076923076923,3.387596202278945,1.164708689745198,0.4698972170218828,0.049818892540992,0.893616184592247,0.8864956985820424,4.722027972027972,4.0,2.88497507823114,44.0,31.0,44.43318233378848,1.4685314685314683,1.0,0.775987490024206,572,195,0.3409090909090909,2764,13,8.11.3,Circumstances preventing attainment of 85%,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
574,574,"A stoppage of work which has dragged on, may, in many cases, be the trigger which causes the employer to take or forestall certain decisions in respect of the future of the business, or an activity which was particularly impacted by the stoppage. Whatever the motives, an employer could, during the stoppage of work, declare bankruptcy, proceed to sell the business, transfer the activities elsewhere, or restructure.As well, a business is not sheltered from an act of God such as fire, an explosion, or a natural catastrophe like an earthquake, mud slide, tornado or flood, which may irreparably affect what would have been the normal situation, had there not been a stoppage of work.The regulations provide for a particular treatment in the case of a discontinuance of business, permanent restructuring, or an act of God where such circumstances prevent the attainment of 85% of the normal activities for the two indicators (EI Regulation 53(2)). These circumstances will not be considered if they don't affect these two indicators, or they only affect activities not implicated in the stoppage of work. Except when it concerns the discontinuance of business, it is at the time activities resume that these circumstances could apply.  It is important that these circumstances become concrete and, in the long term, permanently modify the normal situation (Digest 8.11.1) of the business or activity impacted by the stoppage of work. They must not simply be projections or probabilities, or form part of a statement of intentions or strategies used to force negotiations.It is important to analyze the pertinent facts beyond the mere intentions, statements or any action on the employer's part (CUB 46110, CUB 24335, FCA A-38-96, CUB 31276). For example, the negotiations should be examined as to whether they have broken off, whether there is no further dialogue, operations have been transferred, assets liquidated, notice of closure sent to the Department of Labour, payment of amounts due on final closure, etc. Such actions may be an indication as to whether the action is intended merely to intimidate or counter an uncompromising union.It may happen that workers receive a letter informing them that their employment will end at such a date, if they do not return to work (FCA A-814-91; CUB 20138), or that the business will close if the offer is rejected. Such notices do not necessarily signify that the employer has closed the business, even when accumulated leave credits or reimbursements of pension contributions have been paid. It may be a tactic to incite the workers to return to work.The sale or cessation of parts of the business will not necessarily put an end to the dispute or to the stoppage of work (CUB 21211). The dispute and stoppage could continue, even if there is a new buyer. Generally, the new buyer must recognize the present union, and respect the agreements and contracts previously signed. Selling all or part of the business may, however, lead to a permanent restructuring of activities.An employer could proceed with a temporary restructuring of activities in order to maintain essential services, until a solution is found to the dispute. This is not what permanent restructuring means. Such exceptional or temporary measures must not be included in the consideration of adjusting what would constitute a normal situation (Digest 8.11.6). Neither could they be used in the calculation of the 85% minimum (EI Regulation 53(3)).It must be a true and long-term restructuring of the group of workers or of the activities affected by the stoppage of work (FCA A-38-96, CUB 31276) and not just a shift of roles or a minor change in duties. Nor does this apply to the regular restructuring between the active season and the off-season (Digest 8.11.5).In order to consider the effects of a permanent restructuring of activities which could arise because of changes in the economic conditions or market, or result from technological change, at least some level of resumption of activities would be necessary (EI Regulation 53(2)).In conclusion, when a prescribed circumstance prevents the attainment of a minimum of 85% of the normal situation, a new calculation will be made. The intent is to see whether the number of employees at work, and the production activities, attain at least 85%, having adjusted the normal situation as a result of these new circumstances. In other words, the decline in the number of employees and in the activities that are attributable to these circumstances would be subtracted from the normal situation.",46.81630000000004,14.202104255319153,14.892364546884934,17.670297872340424,16.88441489361702,12.27191489361702,58.27148936170212,8.48,3.374304772723986,0.849759673480403,0.4483938384529823,0.0617235790986888,0.857868917286396,0.8465332414792932,4.941489361702128,4.0,3.047371018144533,30.08,26.0,15.896968264420735,1.5305851063829787,1.0,0.863947322930893,752,302,0.4015957446808511,3826,25,8.11.4,Discontinuance of business permanent restructuring act of God,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
575,575,"When there is a resumption of activities and there are changes due to technology or in economic or market conditions, these may prevent the attainment of a minimum of 85% of the normal level in the two indicators previously mentioned (EI Regulation 53(2)(b)) and Digest 8.11.3). In this case a new calculation is provided to determine whether the minimum of 85% is attained, but this time, taking into account these changes on the normal level. This element is critical as it determines when the stoppage of work terminates (Digest 8.11.1).In many cases, these technological or economical changes are not solely occurring at the business where the stoppage of work occurred, however they nonetheless have a bearing on determining the situation that would have been normal. Most of the time, the impact is on a sector of activities which the business is part of, or even on the whole economy, for example, computerization, automation, free trade, quota reduction, high interest rates, dollar exchange, or a decline in market demand for products or services, etc.These changes may occur in a cycle of transformation, technological progress, rationalization of activities, international trade, economic growth or recession, or market evolution. They will have a bearing on the activities of a whole group of businesses and transform these businesses from their normal situation for an undetermined period, if not forever.It is only when activities impacted by the stoppage resume, that we must determine whether these changes prevent the attainment of a minimum of 85% of the normal level for each indicator (EI Regulation 53(2)(b)(i)).Where the regular off-season in the sector of activities of which the business is a part, originates from the conditions of the economy or market, this does not properly lead to a finding of a change from the normal situation. These are annually recurring conditions and the levels reflect the normal situation which, at that time, has already taken into account the conditions of the economy or market tied to the off-season. Therefore there will not be any adjustment to the levels if the parties come to an agreement about the labour dispute, during the off-season (Digest 8.11.8).Changes due to technology or in the conditions of the economy or market that result in a permanent restructuring of the activities of a business are not relevant unless there has been some resumption of activities (EI Regulation 53(2)(a)) and Digest 8.11.4). At that point, these circumstances could have a significant bearing on the termination of the stoppage of work.Supposing that at the resumption of activities, the changes in technology or in the conditions of the economy or market lead to a reduction of 10% of the work force and the business' activities, to the point where the 85% minimum of the 100 employees normally at work and the 1000 units normally produced each day, cannot be attained. The regulatory text (EI Regulation 53(2)) provides that the minimum of 85% which determines the termination of the stoppage of work must be recalculated but this time, on the basis of 90 employees and 900 units of production, which constitute the normal level, adjusted because of the changes at the business.",32.39224842767297,19.713490566037738,17.971250198000288,23.77987421383648,24.09669182389937,12.796679245283016,73.22327044025157,12.833333333333334,4.017229660368673,1.0079150647703887,0.4767466255168067,0.0564596940149926,0.9327789274129,0.9264661610126496,4.977358490566037,4.0,3.023720157102116,44.16666666666666,47.0,17.285993045108967,1.532075471698113,1.0,0.8943794275036511,530,200,0.3773584905660377,2709,12,8.11.5,Changes due to technology economic or market conditions,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
576,576,"As we have seen, what constitutes the normal situation of a business corresponds to the levels of the work force and activities which would normally have existed, had it not been for the dispute and the stoppage of work (Digest 8.11.1). These levels have nothing to do with what would have been obtained because of exceptional or temporary measures taken by the employer to increase activities. For example, the employer may increase the capacity of production or the quantity of stored products, or, delay certain contracts, in anticipation of the stoppage of work, or to lessen its effects.An employer may, for a temporary period, give priority to certain tasks and in doing so, drop others that are less useful, or use other employees, even strikebreakers, to maintain essential services.The fact that the employer has taken steps to maintain the firm's production, or that of a more limited group of workers, at a normal level, does not necessarily mean there has been no stoppage of work. As a general rule, there is a stoppage of work when an employer maintains operations with the help of exceptional or temporary measures, no matter how successful these measures may be (FCA A-340-79, CUB 5266B, FCA A-143-80, CUB 5869 and FCA A-556-91, CUB 19727). Oftentimes, such measures have a detrimental impact on the work, which must be performed elsewhere, and thus disrupts the operations of the firm as a whole. Temporarily abandoning office and maintenance work for strictly production work constitutes a stoppage of work in sectors other than production (CUB 21211); whatever the level of production, there is a stoppage of work if the interruption of operations in other sectors is relatively significant.It is important to know which of the measures used by the employer will become permanent, whether strikers will return to work once the dispute is settled, and whether they have actually returned to work.In order to determine the permanent or temporary nature of the measures taken by the employer, consideration must be given to:the volume of operations affectedthe number of employees on strike,the number and type of replacement workers, and whether the replacement workers are permanent or temporary (Digest 8.11.7),the hours worked are normal, or the operations are performed at the expense of other operations, such as maintenance or repairs,the importance of the neglected operations, and whether the link between employer and employees is permanently broken (Digest 8.13.0).To authorize payment of EI benefits to strikers simply because the employer has managed to restart and maintain operations through exceptional measures would be to violate the very purpose of the legislative provisions dealing with labour disputes, and create a major source of inequity.This is particularly true when the dispute affects only a small number of workers, and where the employer's measures succeed in preventing the stoppage of work. It is hard to claim that a stoppage of work has taken place when a strike by some employees has no significant impact on ongoing operations.The employer could also take exceptional and temporary measures at the resumption of activities in order to compensate for the effect of the stoppage of work. These measures are not to be taken into account when calculating the 85% minimum (EI Regulation 53(3)) and Digest 8.11.3 to 8.11.5).",37.64233333333334,17.118,16.728156217252725,20.848484848484848,20.547533333333327,12.910327272727264,67.57575757575756,11.333333333333334,3.6459624534226074,0.947290998655383,0.4633694061646657,0.0582304424351009,0.8619793653488159,0.86258864402771,5.02,4.0,2.8644466386118186,36.66666666666666,32.0,27.241308501775183,1.56,1.0,0.8754427451295715,550,229,0.4163636363636364,2834,15,8.11.6,Exceptional or temporary measures,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
577,577,"It must be remembered that, the fact that prior to or following a stoppage of work attributable to a labour dispute, an employer succeeded in resuming or substantially maintaining activities by exceptional or temporary measures, is not sufficient to conclude that a stoppage did not occur or has terminated. A stoppage of work may nevertheless terminate with the return to normal operations using regular, permanent means, although this does not exclude the possibility that some means considered temporary may after a time become permanent (FCA A-143-80, CUB 5869 and  FCA A-556-91, CUB 19727).The termination of a stoppage of work does not necessarily imply that the regular employees return to their work; the employer may, for example, have hired replacement workers that lead to a resumption of operations (FCA A-38-96, CUB 31276). The issue then becomes focused on the permanent or provisional nature of the action taken by the employer.Radical positions are taken from time to time, particularly in highly contested disputes. For example, an employer may permanently dismiss the striking employees and hire replacement workers, describing them as permanent employees. Such action should normally be viewed in the context of an overall reactive strategy to wear down, discredit and intimidate, in order to force a favourable solution to the dispute, and to remove radical elements. They generally constitute exceptional or temporary measures that should not be taken into account when calculating the 85% minimum (EI Regulation 53(3) and Digest 8.11.6).",28.698571428571427,17.951428571428576,18.699421769314853,22.48979591836735,20.792693877551024,14.218285714285711,69.28571428571428,12.0,3.7831780671437727,1.2304345542342416,0.4361612515780862,0.0730517026820281,0.8522545595963796,0.8398365139961242,5.248979591836735,4.0,3.0087031886070994,35.0,25.0,23.682422655994102,1.6857142857142855,1.0,0.9406901504659616,245,141,0.5755102040816327,1319,7,8.11.7,New employees permanently hired,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
578,578,"This is not a question of seasonal termination of employment of a sole individual (Digest 8.13.0 to 8.13.5), but rather the termination of the whole workforce of a firm or of a particular field of activity due to a shutdown during the off-season; for example, maritime transportation on navigable waterways during winter, agriculture or some kind of leisure activities specific to some seasons.The off-season is associated with a period of the year where there is a reduced volume of activity in a sector of the economy. It is often expected to last a fairly long period, a season if not more. It will recur year after year, at a relatively fixed period of time, which for all practical purposes excludes any shutdown that would be only occasional or of a short duration.The question here is whether all workers who lost their employment due to a work stoppage attributable to a labour dispute, before the beginning of the off-season, will remain disentitled to benefits for the duration of the off-season. This is particularly important when the off-season lasts from three to six months (depending on the type of business and activities).At one time it was held that the disentitlement could be terminated as of the date the claimant could prove that, in the absence of the labour dispute, the claimant would not have been able to work, which is the case in a seasonal shutdown.  This line of thinking appears contrary to the text of the legislation, which limits the termination of the disentitlement to one of only two circumstances (EI Act 36(1)(a) and (b)). It is not possible to interpret any of these two paragraphs as signifying that the disentitlement ends when the labour dispute ceases to be the real cause of the unemployment (FCA A-181-83, CUB 7842).The final resolution rests on the reasons for the claimant's loss of employment at the time they became unemployed, more so than reasons that arise during the work stoppage, regardless of whether it is a seasonal shutdown, or a vacation period during Christmas or during the summer (FCA A-559-89, CUB 6831). The question is approached differently if, in a given case, there is a complete and definitive severance of the employer-employee relationship (Digest 8.13.0), or where the conditions of non-application, as provided in the exempting clause of the labour dispute provisions, are fulfilled.A good example would be the teaching field. To determine whether benefits are payable to a teacher during the non-teaching period, we must consider if the claimant has continuity of employment.  If they do, then the employer/employee relationship has not ceased and they are generally not entitled to benefits during the non-teaching period.  If there is a work stoppage attributable to a labour dispute, the appropriate disentitlement will also be imposed. If the labour dispute continues into the teaching period, then they are still subject to disentitlement as they are still involved in the labour dispute by virtue of their vested interest in the outcome of the labour dispute.If their contract has terminated thereby proving they no longer have continuity of employment the disentitlement would not apply after the end date of the contract, as long as the claimant is not participating in, financing or directly interested in the labour dispute (CUB 26330).Finally, the stoppage of work may be considered to have come to an end when the settlement of the dispute occurs during the off-season, even if in fact the resumption of activities only occurs many months later (EI Regulation 53(1) and Digest 8.11.5). Attainment of the 85% minimum may be easily reached when calculated on the basis of a normal situation which represents a reduced, if not virtually nil level of work force and activities.",37.59346698113208,17.890801886792456,16.373557378465907,21.308805031446543,21.15816037735849,11.810628930817607,66.00786163522012,10.4375,3.514108859047739,1.048230994267818,0.4422460759921698,0.0564184702995033,0.8735530455907186,0.8567016422748566,4.822327044025157,4.0,2.9468357819441877,39.75,31.5,23.448080944930226,1.5235849056603774,1.0,0.8765338993748576,636,261,0.410377358490566,3145,16,8.11.8,Shutdown during the off-season,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
579,579,"The termination of the stoppage of work is not the only factor to  consider when deciding whether a disentitlement should be terminated (Digest  8.1.8). Subsection  36(1) of the EIA provides for another, as the following extract shows:. . . a claimant who loses an employment, or is unable to resume an employment, because of a work stoppage ... is not entitled to receive benefit until the earlier ofthe end of the work stoppage, andthe day on which the claimant becomes regularly engaged elsewhere in insurable employment.The termination of the disentitlement as provided for in the legislation  in these circumstances is related to the occurrence of one of two  eventualities. The first being the termination of the stoppage of work, which involves  the workers (claimants) and activities at a given workplace. However, the  second, which consists of becoming regularly employed elsewhere in insurable  employment, is an individual event which involves only the claimant, without  any tie to the collective employees or activities.It is up to the claimant to prove that they became regularly engaged in  insurable employment elsewhere, since they lost or could not resume employment,  due to a stoppage of work (EI Act 36(1)). Employment  or a period of employment that preceded the time when the claimant lost or was  unable to resume a previous employment will not provide relief in this context (CUB  64431). What can be accepted, however, is part-time employment that started  prior to the work stoppage, and then became full time, or where the claimant's  hours were significantly increased since they  lost or were unable to resume employment due  to a stoppage of work.",47.08894716394718,14.58585081585082,15.322241378113624,18.44537684537685,17.00430846930847,11.41440559440559,61.4980574980575,9.444444444444445,3.3244112438725915,0.7468141961420353,0.4479313988103711,0.06027707809563,0.8929147198796272,0.8995581354413714,4.786713286713287,4.0,3.035909507902552,31.77777777777778,34.0,10.389928646720854,1.506993006993007,1.0,0.8517485388174559,286,126,0.4405594405594406,1394,9,8.12.0,Other employment during the stoppage of work,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
580,580,"The insurable employment that the claimant has become engaged in must  respect the meaning that it is given in the legislation (EI Act 2(1)), which means  that an employer-employee relationship exists. Thus, this would exclude all  self-employment (CUB  64431) as well as all other occupations that do not, as such, constitute insurable  employment.Finally, the legislative text specifies that the claimant is regularly  engaged in insurable employment elsewhere than the place of employment where  the stoppage of work is occurring (EI Act 36(1) and CUB  77469). This would exclude all employment that a claimant may begin at  the same premises where the stoppage of work exists.This would mean that a person who resumes their own job before there is  a termination to the stoppage of work, would not meet the requirement to have  the disentitlement terminated. That person must await the collective return of  the workers involved in the stoppage of work, which would then result in the  termination of the stoppage of work (EI Act 36(1)(a)), or they  would have to meet the conditions of non-application (EI Act 36(4)).",50.71272727272729,14.384040404040404,15.021129683784007,18.452525252525252,16.788333333333334,10.41636363636363,57.24242424242424,8.0,3.772163983339341,0.5816543592325001,0.4380224508693811,0.0490029950831258,0.8220261573791504,0.8207860887050629,4.611111111111111,4.0,2.864847516131465,33.0,33.5,8.445906306213285,1.4494949494949494,1.0,0.8378512364488919,198,95,0.4797979797979798,930,6,8.12.1,Engaged elsewhere in insurable employment,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
581,581,"To be hired with an employer does not necessarily mean a claimant is regularly  engaged; the claimant must work in the new occupation and have some form of  work schedule.  If the employment is only  intended for such a short time that it is impossible to determine its  continuity, it is not regular employment, but rather casual employment.  The application of the legislation has created  abundant jurisprudence and interpretations to support this.  The authoritative principles are found in several  judgments of the Federal Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court (S.C.C.  1669883, FCA  A-1198-84, CUB  9488 and FCA  A-765-85, CUB 76911A).Based on these judgments, the determination of whether a claimant was  regularly engaged in insurable employment will require that three criteria be  met. These are:was it firm, serious, genuine employment;was there continuity in the employment;was there regularity in the claimant's pattern of work?An employment will be firm, serious, and genuine when, at a given time,  the worker has some assurance of a certain number of predetermined work  periods. It would not be so where;there is no such assurance,the proposed number of work  periods is vague, imprecise, not defined, or uncertain,it is on an as-needed basis  only,it is unknown whether the  employment will continue or in what manner from day to day (CUB  64431). The fact that the claimant has worked a certain number of periods does  not demonstrate after the fact that the employment meets the first criterion,  if such an assurance did not exist either at the time of hiring or at some  subsequent time during the employment.There must also have been continuity in the employment. This means that  it was pursued uninterrupted, that is, without a lay-off, end of contract or  break in the employer-employee relationship, even for a short period which  required a re-employment. Continuity will not be shown when the employment had  been for an intermittent, sporadic, occasional or on-call basis (CUB  64431 and CUB  55172).There must be regularity in the pattern of work. Generally, this means  that the claimant worked according to a specific pattern, in terms of a  schedule, a number of given hours or days, and that this pattern regularly  repeated itself during the pursued employment (CUB  64431). What needs to be determined at this stage is what pattern of work over  an interval is representative of the claimant's employment.An interval could vary from case to case. One could conclude that in the  majority of cases, an interval of one week, that is, a period of seven days  starting on any day, would be representative of an interval of the employment  under question. This interval could be longer or shorter. In the case of a  person who was engaged to work one week in two, then two weeks would constitute  a representative interval.Once the representative interval is established, what must be examined  is the pattern of work during this interval and in what way it was repeated  during the period of employment. At the very minimum, one could consider that  there was regularity in the pattern of work when, during the claimant's  employment, that specific pattern prevailed for at least two successive intervals,  which would be for at least two successive intervals of seven days in the  majority of cases. It could just as easily be a pattern of part-time work rather  than full-time.The fact that the person had been employed, or even that they had  worked, is not sufficient. What is required, is the fulfillment of all three  criteria previously mentioned.If a claimant had intended to resume the previous employment at the end  of the stoppage of work, rather than remain employed at the most recent  employment, this may be sufficient to show that the claimant was regularly  engaged in other employment (CUB  39266). This factor has no bearing on the regularity of the  employment in question. It is therefore not a question of demanding that the  claimant demonstrate disinterest, distance or detachment from the outcome of  the labour dispute by severing all connection with the labour dispute employer.",52.19323127530368,13.649630566801624,15.021129683784007,17.9640350877193,15.491710526315792,10.06234817813765,56.24612010796221,7.833333333333333,3.1647731678830437,1.054294720190326,0.4530102602295867,0.0631540830353141,0.845930146134418,0.8555146645415913,4.56140350877193,4.0,2.969129549863786,30.875,32.5,15.516959807470878,1.45748987854251,1.0,0.8408521248004887,741,242,0.3265856950067476,3418,24,8.12.2,Regularly,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
582,582,"No matter what time of the year or what the field of activities, it is  inevitable that most firms do experience some movement on the part of their  work force. The same is true during a labour dispute, and even more so when the  stoppage of work lasts a long time. There are many reasons why employees, who  were part of the work force when the stoppage of work began or who would have  resumed their employment during the stoppage of work, may not return to work  once the dispute is over. For example, because the employment was temporary or  about to terminate, or there has been a lay-off, dismissal, resignation or  retirement, during the stoppage of work.The question to be asked in this regard is why the claimant is not  returning to their place of employment and not, why is the claimant unemployed  at the present time. Once a claimant has lost or is unable to resume employment  for reasons related to a labour dispute, they are disentitled from benefits (EI Act 36(1)).An exemption is possible only when one of the two circumstances set  forth in the legislation apply (EI Act 36(1)). This is so  even if, were it not for the stoppage of work, the claimant would have lost  employment for another reason (FCA  A-181-83,  CUB 7842 and FCA  A-209-04, CUB  59992).However, the claimant may still satisfy the exempting conditions (EI Act 36(4) and Digest  8.1.4), in which case a disentitlement may not be imposed, even  though the claimant has lost an employment or is unable to resume a previous employment,  due to the stoppage of work. It is possible for the disentitlement to no longer  apply if the claimant subsequently proves the existence of these exempting  conditions during the stoppage of work.  In  this case the disentitlement would be terminated on the day prior to the  fulfillment of these conditions (FCA  A-942-85, CUB 11403 and FCA  A-814-91, CUB 20138).  It is also important to note that if the  claimant does meet the criteria to be exempt from a disentitlement, they must  also meet all other entitlement provisions to receive benefits.  These other entitlement provisions include, but  are not limited to, having the required number of hours to establish a claim, having  a valid reason for separation, meeting availability criteria.",49.21534037052996,15.925372684187852,15.062637766997836,19.895217578629904,18.23250538560965,8.996682464454974,58.97975010771219,7.909090909090909,3.6602830818954057,0.7652040437083804,0.4588352283918734,0.0327088347016687,0.8801334500312805,0.8996528387069702,4.348341232227488,4.0,2.848377703593457,38.36363636363637,33.0,16.723813871638942,1.4028436018957346,1.0,0.7932125986924735,422,174,0.4123222748815165,1853,11,8.13.0,Termination of employment during a work stoppage,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
583,583,"When a claimant is disentitled from benefits pursuant to the labour  dispute provisions (EI Act 36(1)), there is  no automatic re-entitlement simply because the employer-employee relationship  has been completely and finally severed (FCA  A-814-91, CUB 20138, FCA  A-270-91, CUB 19037, FCA  A-942-85, CUB 11403 and FCA  A-741-87, CUB 14021).While there may be a complete and definitive severance of the  employer-employee relationship, it is not the rupture itself that is the  deciding factor leading to entitlement, but rather it is the absence of direct  interest, participation, and financing in the labour dispute, on the part of  the claimant (EI Act 36(4) and Digest  8.1.4).Moreover, such a separation is not necessary when the claimant otherwise  meets the exempting conditions, even while still maintaining, to some degree,  the employer-employee ties. On the other hand, there could be a complete and  definitive separation, but the direct interest, participation or financing  continue to be present. One of the questions to determine is whether the  severance is complete and final. This may not always be the case, even if the  employee has in fact informed the employer of their intention to resign, or if  the employer has notified the employee of a dismissal. The severance may only be  temporary and may last only until the dispute is resolved and operations resume.A number of indicators may confirm whether the severance is final:termination of individual employment,payment of amounts due on termination of employment,loss of all rights of recall and employment-related benefits,the employee's status in the company,the reasons for severance given by the employer (e.g. incompetence,       misconduct not related to the dispute) or by the claimant (ill health, relocation).The separation must not be the result of actions or intimidation  practices that often occur in labour disputes, or actions whose sole purpose is  to create entitlement to benefits.Other indicators may also cast doubt on the complete and final nature of  the severance, such as:the simultaneous resignation or lay-off of several workers,a long period of employment tied in with substantial benefits (such       as a pension),the fact that neither the employer nor the employee have taken       appropriate steps to make the termination of employment final, or,the claimant is still a member of the union in dispute with the       employer (FCA       A-139-88, CUB       14613).Even if the termination of employment appears to be a final severance,  it can happen that the claimant remains directly interested in the outcome of  the dispute or continues to be involved. For example, an employee who used all  avenues of recourse to ensure that their return to work is possible, or where,  because of the reasons giving rise to the separation, it is highly likely that  this worker's return forms part of the back-to-work agreement (FCA  A-209-04, CUB  59992).It cannot be said that a claimant who was dismissed during a stoppage of  work is not directly interested in the labour dispute, as long as there is the  possibility that they will subsequently return to work as a result of a return  to work protocol, or as a result of a grievance filed against the dismissal.  The fact that, following either the termination of the stoppage of work or a  judgment issued on a grievance, a worker will not be reinstated, does not  change the direct interest that the claimant had in the labour dispute, before  the final decision concerning their employment, was made. In such a case, the  disentitlement will not be retroactively terminated to the date of the  dismissal.It may happen, in the case of a dispute impacting such industries as  construction or logging, that an employee, who has been principally employed in  this occupation by several employers in the course of a year, and whose working  conditions are usually subject to general rather than to local agreements, decides  to quit employment with a specific employer, in the course of a generalized  stoppage of work in the industry. Even though such a termination of employment  may prove to be final, the employee nonetheless remains directly interested in  the outcome of the dispute affecting the industry and may also continue to  finance and participate in the dispute. Unless the employee has also decided to  no longer work in this industry (such as for reasons of retirement, health or  career change), it cannot be concluded that all the exempting conditions are met.Participating or financing, like direct interest, do not necessarily  cease with the termination of employment, even where the severance proves to be  final. A claimant may for one reason or another continue to participate in the  dispute or finance it. In either case the exempting conditions are deemed not  to be met (EI Act 36(4), Digest  8.1.4; FCA  A-209-04, CUB  59992).",23.276850014484356,23.41225304171495,19.412932280823824,27.60049246813442,27.467811413673232,11.027624565469296,81.1680909617613,14.6875,3.881753141213666,0.9969377722356212,0.4214438244683738,0.0507648653727998,0.9091529687245686,0.9096394905022211,4.6558516801854,4.0,2.9914493727889693,53.9375,36.0,41.542852498955824,1.522595596755504,1.0,0.8674020465655896,863,291,0.3371958285052143,4042,16,8.13.1,Complete and final severance of the employer-employee relationship,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
584,584,"Even when the employment in question is strictly temporary, with its  duration known in advance, it must not be taken for granted that the claimant  meets the requirements of the exempting conditions on the predetermined date where  the employment would have ended (EI Act 36(4); Digest  8.5.10). Depending on the circumstances, there are many factors at  play, including the fact that there is an ongoing stoppage of work attributable  to a labour dispute. These factors may modify the situation, thereby advancing  or postponing the originally set date of departure.Due to operational delays caused by the stoppage of work, it is possible  that the employer will attempt to extend an individual's period of employment,  or to postpone the planned lay-off date because of the anticipated need for the  employee's services when operations resume. It is not uncommon for the  temporary employment to be extended because the employer needs staff to replace  an employee who was supposed to return from leave but was unable to do so, or  because the employer feels that this is a skilled worker whom they wish to  retain, with a view to a permanent position in the future.On occasion, temporary employees retain a right of recall under the  provisions of a collective agreement, or an agreement or  contract of service, despite the stoppage of  work.  This is often the situation in the  case of seasonal workers.This means that the mere possibility or a simple statement that the  employment would have terminated in the near future, is not by itself  sufficient to conclude that the employment would have terminated during the  stoppage, and that there would have been a complete and definitive severance of  the employer-employee relationship (FCA  A-942-85, CUB 11403, and FCA  A-139-88, CUB 14613; Digest  8.13.0 and Digest  8.13.1).A worker in this situation cannot gain relief from disentitlement on  these grounds alone (Digest  8.13.0 and Digest  8.13.1; FCA  -181-83, CUB  7842). Nor can they be exempted from it unless it is proven that  at a precise date there is, on their part, an absence of direct interest,  participation and financing (EI Act 36(4) and  Digest  8.1.4).Finally, term employees discharged on the eve of a stoppage of work  attributable to a labour dispute could be exempted from disentitlement to  benefits, if they suffered a complete severance of the employee-employer  relationship (FCA  A-594-91, CUB  19771). Such an eventuality implies that the severance is complete and final,  not of a temporary nature, that there exist no recall rights, and there is no promise  or pattern of employment that guarantees they will be rehired once the dispute  is settled (FCA  A-1198-82, CUB  7454).",32.079966395112024,20.98262525458249,18.026119701940384,25.17971486761711,24.444501018329937,10.218818737270867,73.94725050916497,12.2,3.8455035438101817,1.1315110514579465,0.4546597160071761,0.0512179352663736,0.9026327199406096,0.8918410092592239,4.527494908350305,4.0,2.9331932852698404,49.1,49.5,27.613221470882387,1.476578411405295,1.0,0.8351745939046457,491,213,0.4338085539714867,2242,10,8.13.2,Temporary employment or employment about to terminate,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
585,585,"Unless it is for reasons that have absolutely nothing to do with the  dispute (such as incompetence or misconduct), it is rare for a final notice of  dismissal to be issued by an employer during a labour dispute. Dismissals often  form part of pressure tactics designed to expedite the settlement of the  dispute by deliberately targeting certain groups of workers.Apart from special instances or where there is a discontinuance of  business or permanent restructuring (Digest  8.11.4), it cannot be determined prior to the resumption of  operations whether a dismissal is permanent and whether the employer-employee  relationship  has been completely and  definitively severed in the way required by the labour dispute provisions (EI Act  36(4); Digest  8.1.4 and Digest  8.13.1). This is also true when a worker who has been dismissed lodges a  grievance or takes advantage of other avenues of appeal against the dismissal (FCA  A-209-04, CUB  59992; CUB  71732).A disentitlement must be maintained unless the complete and definitive  severance of the employer-employee relationship has occurred (FCA  A-181-83, CUB  7842 and Digest  Chapter 7), and the worker no longer has  a direct interest in the dispute, is no longer participating in it, or  financing it (FCA  A-942-85, CUB 11403 and Digest  8.13.1).",18.388269230769254,25.227564102564106,18.7741,28.52820512820513,29.498076923076923,10.757094017094015,85.42307692307692,15.75,3.56644592476489,0.9016765789200804,0.4724862852664577,0.0419435097413511,0.8962434530258179,0.8878338932991028,4.602564102564102,3.5,3.13379597071376,58.5,55.5,28.848743473503312,1.5256410256410255,1.0,0.8431375921773018,234,125,0.5341880341880342,1083,4,8.13.3,Dismissal,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes
586,586,"It is to be expected that some employees choose not to return to work  following a stoppage for many reasons; they may have found other employment, decided  to go back to school, or to change their career. Regardless of the reason, the  result is that the worker has submitted a resignation to the employer during  the stoppage, or one that will take effect during the stoppage.The intent to resign is not by itself sufficient, nor is resigning for  personal reasons, or as a mass movement to exert pressure on an employer and  affect the outcome of the dispute. If, on the other hand, the resignation is  genuine and is formally submitted to the employer, it may result in a complete  and definitive severance of the employer-employee relationship (FCA A-942-85 and FCA A-181-83, CUB  7842, CUB 11403; Digest 8.13.1). Consideration can then be given to terminating the  disentitlement from the date the resignation becomes effective, provided that the  claimant proves there is no longer a direct interest, participation or  financing of the dispute (EI Act 36(4); and Digest  8.1.4).For industries in which negotiations are conducted centrally and the  results are applied to the entire industry, the fact that the worker submits a  resignation to the employer during a stoppage of work which is having a  substantial impact on the industry, is not sufficient to cancel the disentitlement.  The worker must also prove that they have left the industry in question (Digest  8.13.1).",34.31831115335868,19.36203422053233,16.728156217252725,22.704435994930293,22.138339670468945,10.5548288973384,67.78770595690747,10.5,4.034163121920489,1.572169895803587,0.4242816083996526,0.0425534866305942,0.903944218158722,0.903415873646736,4.596958174904943,4.0,2.947756488219476,43.833333333333336,37.0,25.05604828291077,1.5133079847908746,1.0,0.8402955800189366,263,132,0.5019011406844106,1224,6,8.13.4,Resignation,Chapter 8 - Labour disputes

588,588,"To be entitled to benefits, it is not enough to have contributed to the Employment Insurance (EI) fund. Claimants must also prove that no circumstances or conditions exist that could result in disentitling or disqualifying them from receiving benefits (EI Act 49(1)).The legislation has always been intended to provide relief to insured persons who are involuntarily unemployed until they are able to find comparable employment (CUB 62318,  CUB 76022). There are a number of provisions in the legislation that address these  concepts, including a provision that requires claimants to apply for, accept  and take advantage of job vacancies or other opportunities for suitable  employment. More specifically, section 27(1) of the EIA indicates:A claimant is disqualified from receiving benefits under this Part if, without good cause since the interruption of earnings giving rise to the claim, the claimant:has not applied for a suitable employment that is vacant after becoming aware that it is vacant or becoming vacant, or has failed to accept the employment after it has been offered to the claimanthas not taken advantage of an opportunity for suitable employmenthas not carried out a written direction given to the claimant by the Commission with a view to assisting the claimant to find suitable employment, if the direction was reasonable having regard both to the claimant's circumstances and to the usual means of obtaining that employment, orhas not attended an interview that the Commission has directed the claimant to attend to enable the Commission or another appropriate agency:          to provide information and instruction to help the claimant find employment, orto identify whether the claimant might be assisted by job training or other employment assistanceOther provisions in the legislation require claimants to prove that they  are capable of and available for work and unable to obtain suitable employment  (EI Act 18(1)). For  this purpose the Commission may require the claimant to prove that they are  making reasonable and customary efforts to obtain suitable employment (EI Act 50(8)).Generally, those claiming regular benefits are required to seek and  accept all opportunities for suitable employment. Claimants are not expected to  seek or accept employment that is not suitable.The majority of this chapter deals with a claimant's expectations to apply  for, accept, or take advantage of opportunities for suitable employment. Employment that is not suitable is defined in section 6(4) of the EIA. The elements of suitable employment as they relate to the issue of availability  for work are discussed in chapter 10 of this Digest.As will be discussed later in this chapter, claimants are also expected to  explore and/or accept assistance in obtaining suitable employment, by carrying  out written directions of the Commission, attending scheduled interviews, and  attending any course, training program or employment activity to which they  have been referred by the Commission or an authorized representative (EI Act 27(1)(c) and (d) and 27(1.1)). If  a claimant fails to comply with any such written direction, fails to attend a  scheduled interview or has their referral to a course, program or employment  activity terminated by the Commission or authorized representative, they may be  disqualified from receiving benefits (EIA 28(1)(b)).",21.331910946196672,22.456920222634512,20.779040381047903,27.3922077922078,27.5987012987013,14.217736549165116,83.13729128014842,16.727272727272727,3.540067928928455,1.2460563556358295,0.4654660446232863,0.0610204770651899,0.8858223795890808,0.8526696960131327,5.207792207792208,4.0,3.205609436651234,49.0,38.0,50.44889403238597,1.6048237476808906,1.0,0.9246445019684394,539,212,0.3933209647495361,2838,11,9.1.0,Authority,Chapter 9 - Refusal of employment

590,590,"When the opportunity for work arises from the usual or last employer, it is sometimes difficult to make the distinction between a refusal of employment and voluntarily leaving employment. A detailed review of all the facts of the case must be conducted before a decision is made whether a refusal is considered a voluntary leaving, or if it is in fact a refusal of employment. Where the employment opportunity is with an employer for whom the claimant has never before worked, the case is clearly one of refusal of employment.The word employment is defined as the act of employing or the  state of being employed (EI Act 2(1)); it  therefore refers to that relationship which exists between an employer and an  employee. The inference is that the question will be one of voluntarily leaving  employment where the employer-employee relationship could have been maintained  without a break had the claimant accepted the opportunity to work; examples are  the refusal to accept a renewal of a contract of employment, or to accept a  transfer (EI Act 29(b.1)(i) and (iii)). Essentially,  if the refusal results in a complete severance of the employer-employee  relationship, the refusal will be considered under the principles of a  voluntary leaving (Digest   6).The issue is also one of voluntarily leaving employment where the claimant refuses to return to work following a gap, such as after a lay-off; upon settlement of a labour dispute; or at the end of a leave of absence without pay (EI Act 29(b.1)(ii)).Occasionally, instead of immediately refusing an offer of employment, a claimant may decide to try it out. These cases are treated as voluntarily leaving employment if the claimant, after having accepted employment, decides to leave the job because the duties or the working conditions turned out to be unacceptable to them (FCA A-57-06, CUB  65058A, CUB 67121, CUB 67365).Other than self-employment, the definition of employment is not restrictive, in the context of refusing employment. Any refusal to work in suitable employment for an employer, whether the employment is insurable, or whether it is in Canada or abroad, may lead to a 7 to 12 week disqualification. Although service in the Canadian Forces is employment, a refusal to enlist or re-enlist will not result in a disqualification.If  more than 1 opportunity of employment is refused, each refusal may result in  a separate disqualification, even where such opportunities are with the same  employer (FCA A-928-96, CUB 35473). However, in  practice, a maximum of 2 disqualifications will be applied where several  opportunities of employment are refused at the same time. What is to be  considered is any refusal of employment which has occurred since the  interruption of earnings giving rise to the claim for benefit, even when the  refusal precedes the claim itself.A claimant who, without good cause and since the interruption of earnings giving  rise to the claim, has not carried out a written direction given to them by the  Commission or an authority that the Commission designates, with a view to  assisting the claimant to find suitable employment, will be subject to a disqualification. The same is true where  a claimant has not attended an interview that the Commission or designated  authority has directed the claimant to attend, to provide information and  instruction to help the claimant find employment, or to identify whether the  claimant might be assisted by job training (EI Act 27(1)(c) and (d)).A claimant is also subject to a disqualification if the claimant has been  referred to a course or employment activity and the Commission or designated  authority has terminated the referral because, without good cause, the claimant  has not attended or participated in the course or activity, and is unlikely to  successfully complete it; the claimant has, without good cause, withdrawn from  the course or activity, or the organization providing the course or activity; has expelled the claimant (EI Act 27(1.1)).",26.515743045388035,21.680645262497386,19.7143461543385,26.424973854842086,25.60947500522904,11.865475841874083,79.97165864881823,15.214285714285714,3.61635027185822,0.846669267109694,0.4720818450319068,0.0504330739266031,0.920235771399278,0.888210654258728,4.808199121522694,4.0,3.2661075298680866,48.785714285714285,36.0,31.541760462301795,1.5461200585651538,1.0,0.9491440377133442,683,244,0.3572474377745241,3335,14,9.1.2,Applicability,Chapter 9 - Refusal of employment
591,591,"The legislation specifically stipulates that a claimant must prove that no circumstances or conditions exist that have the effect of  disqualifying the person from receiving benefits (EI Act 49(1)(b)).Where there is an indication that employment was refused in some way, it is up to the Commission to contact the employer to obtain  all relevant details of the vacancy, offer or opportunity, as well as any  action or inaction, on the part of the claimant in applying for or accepting  the vacancy, offer or opportunity.Once this is done, and if the vacancy, offer or opportunity appears suitable, it is then up to the claimant to provide evidence to support any contention that it was not suitable. It is also up to the claimant to show good cause for refusing the employment, if it was suitable. The resulting decision will hinge on the balance of probabilities, in other words the claimant will be either disqualified, or free of disqualification based on consideration of all the claimant's circumstances.",32.31867647058826,19.309705882352947,18.243605946275583,23.58823529411765,22.732764705882357,12.107999999999995,71.91176470588235,12.5,3.455169172932331,0.6765727430373351,0.4819131161236424,0.0284665334734125,0.8860048651695251,0.8393736481666565,4.864705882352941,4.0,3.3023059993729853,42.5,31.5,26.76284738214527,1.5529411764705885,1.0,1.0000692017578077,170,92,0.5411764705882353,841,4,9.1.3,Proof,Chapter 9 - Refusal of employment

However, a delay of more than 1 week between refusing and accepting  is not acceptable.

593,593,"When  an offer of employment is made but the person to whom it is made either refuses  it or fails to respond to it, the case falls precisely within the words used in  the legislation, has failed to accept the employment after it has been  offered to the claimant (EI Act  27(1)(a)). Whether the employment opportunity  was found through the claimant's own efforts rather than through the  Commission, is irrelevant since it does not alter the fact that there was a  refusal of employment.The  expression failure to accept also includes cases where a person  accepts the offer in the first place, but fails to report for work, as well as cases  where a person acts in such a manner as to prompt the employer to withdraw the  offer. The expression has not taken advantage of an opportunity is  broad enough in meaning to also include the above cases.Once  an offer of employment has been made, the claimant is entitled to a reasonable  period of time in order to make the necessary arrangements to enable them to  report for work. The length of that period of time can be affected by the  location of the place of work, the need to make new transportation or child  care arrangements, and whether the claimant has worked there in the past,  particularly on an on-call basis. Obviously, the question of refusal does not  arise where the employer, subsequent to an interview, simply decides to hire  someone else.",54.05258426966293,15.195826645264848,14.138980108339055,19.15227394328518,17.804462279293737,8.59565543071161,57.61851257356876,7.428571428571429,3.277717251401462,0.4687078674913226,0.4563505597340183,0.0334248430636325,0.9106271763642628,0.9294960260391236,4.280898876404494,4.0,2.671764264611339,38.142857142857146,35.0,12.506324930422451,1.348314606741573,1.0,0.7152871704627384,267,123,0.4606741573033708,1147,7,9.2.1,Offer of employment,Chapter 9 - Refusal of employment

595,595,"Rather  than wait for an offer of employment and flatly refuse the offer, a person  might report for an interview and reveal future intentions which do not meet  the prospective employer's needs. In these situations, although, a frequent  contention is that there was no refusal of employment since no actual offer of  employment was made, it is the claimant's level of interest and behaviour  towards the opportunity that must be examined.Claimants  are expected to take advantage of any opportunity of suitable employment, or  make good use of any favourable circumstances that might lead to immediate  re-employment. They do so by showing interest and prudence in their dealings  with potential employers, and by acting in a way that will encourage, rather  than discourage employers from offering them suitable employment. Where  claimants fail to report for an interview or, during the course of an  interview, either voluntarily reveal future intentions which may not meet the  employer's needs, or indicate an unwillingness to accept the conditions offered  by the prospective employer, it may be said that a refusal of employment has  occurred (CUB 57919).  More specifically, the applicant is said to have not taken advantage of  an opportunity for suitable employment.The expression has not taken advantage of an opportunity includes  situations where a claimant does not display the interest and prudence which  are to be expected from someone desirous of finding work as soon as possible.  This could include haggling over the employment offered, demanding a salary  which is higher than the starting rate for that type of work, restricting to  certain hours or to a certain type of work, or arriving late for the interview  (EI Act 27(1)(b)). Likewise, interest and prudence  are not shown by those who deliberately impose conditions on their hiring  during an interview (for example, vacations planned in the future, availability  limited to specific times, restricted to temporary employment), with the intent  to discourage an employer from offering them employment.This  is also the case for claimants who have been laid off from seasonal employment  (including school related occupations). Claimants seeking work during their  off-season are free to disclose their intention to return to their normal  occupation when the season resumes. Although they may have an assurance of  returning to their seasonal employment, claimants seeking work during their  off-season are expected to act in a manner that shows interest and prudence,  and which will not discourage prospective employers from offering them  employment. In fact, some employers may be looking for casual or temporary  assistance and hiring a seasonal worker during their off-season may be ideal.  It is up to the employer whether they will or will not hire an individual.A  refusal of employment will not always be said to occur where the claimant  advises the employer that they are available for only a limited period of time,  for reasons previously mentioned or because they are waiting for better  employment to become available. In some cases, employers may require new employees  to stay in their employ for a reasonable period of time, whether it is to  justify training expenses or for other reasons. The fact that a person has  acted out of honesty in disclosing future intentions would not automatically be  held against them. In these cases, claimants will not automatically be  disqualified from receiving benefits for the sole reason that they honestly  declare to their prospective employer that they intended to return to their  seasonal employment. Before a disqualification from benefits is imposed, all  circumstances of the case must be assessed.Finally,  there are cases where a person is neither offered nor referred to employment  but nevertheless has personal knowledge of an employment opportunity. A claimant  who fails to take reasonable steps to obtain the employment can be said to have  not taken advantage of an opportunity for suitable employment.  However, failing to resume an employment (EI Act  29(b.1)(ii)) at the end of  a lay-off period or at the end of a period of leave, which results in the  severance of the employee-employer relationship, is considered voluntarily  leaving employment and not a refusal of employment.",42.0999191580232,15.799905430140331,17.122413403193683,20.6327028676022,18.19832824893228,11.660402684563756,63.12538133007932,9.909090909090908,3.4282276121945667,0.8269981428907687,0.4548826740335618,0.0403885398923406,0.8809822655859447,0.8873977601528168,4.818791946308725,4.0,3.021741555881172,33.86363636363637,33.0,12.102950258456724,1.5409395973154365,1.0,0.8568722131333858,745,265,0.3557046979865771,3609,22,9.2.3,Has not taken advantage of  an opportunity,Chapter 9 - Refusal of employment
596,596,"The  claimant may be notified of a job vacancy, potential vacancy or opportunity, by  someone, or they may discover one while conducting their own job search. If  there is a contention that there was a misunderstanding regarding an offer of  employment or its refusal, or that all essential information was not provided  to the claimant, the Commission must clarify the actual events.An  argument that one was not properly notified of the possibility of employment is  not sufficient, where a claimant does not bother to ask for the particulars of  the job, or where a claimant expresses their refusal before being given all the  particulars (CUB 57919).The  telephone, among other methods, is still a proper and normal means of  communication. Where the claimant contends they did not receive a telephone call,  were not given a message, or did not understand the message, the question  becomes one of credibility.Provided  there is evidence supporting its issuance, any notice by mail is presumed to  have been received by the addressee in the ordinary course of mail delivery (EI Act  134(2)). Further, claimants should  reasonably know that, being unemployed and in receipt of benefits, they are  likely to receive notifications from the Commission. It is reasonable to expect  claimants to take the necessary steps to ensure that they can be contacted  without delay.Thus,  for claimants who do not pick up their mail every day or who absent themselves  from their residence without telling the Commission, it will be considered that  the notice was nevertheless received, although there may be extenuating  circumstances present.

599,599,"The  claimant's health and physical capability is one of the criteria used to  determine what constitutes suitable employment. Specifically, EIR 9.002(1)(a) states, the claimant's health and physical  capabilities allow them to commute to the place of work and perform the  work.Consequently, throughout the duration of the claim, whether the claimant's health and physical capabilities allow the claimant to commute to the place of work and perform the work involved, must be examined to determine if employment is suitable.In many cases, particularly when the claimant has performed the potential employment under similar or identical circumstances in the past, it may be difficult for them to prove the employment was not suitable. However, each situation must still be examined on its own merits, particularly if the claimant indicates that their health or physical capabilities were a factor in refusing the employment. The Commission must obtain all relevant facts to determine the extent to which the claimant's health and capabilities prevented them from pursuing the employment.If health reasons or physical capabilities place significant limitations on a claimant's ability to accept specific types of work, working conditions (including heavy or outside work or other aggravating conditions), hours of work (including shift work and night work) or daily commuting distance, then the employment becomes unsuitable.When a claimant indicates health or physical capabilities as the reason for not pursuing otherwise suitable employment, it may have to be supported by medical evidence. However, detailed and convincing explanations, first-hand observations, previous employment modifications and plausible or credible statements, including evidence concerning the claimant's age and previous work experience, may be acceptable when a physician has not been consulted. Pregnancy does not in itself render a person incapable of work and  therefore not available for work. Any employment offered during a period where  the claimant is claiming EI maternity benefits is not suitable. However, a  claimant's pregnancy does not render an otherwise suitable employment  unsuitable, if the claimant is claiming regular benefits. Consequently, an  offer of permanent work may be suitable for a pregnant claimant who is  available for only a few months; rather than refuse the opportunity outright  she should contact the employer and allow the employer to decide whether or not  to hire her. A claimant who refuses to return to work after the end of her maternity  leave is considered to have voluntarily left employment (EI Act 29(b)(1)(ii); Digest 6.3.6). Entitlement to regular EI benefits, if  requested, would be considered based on the voluntary leaving provisions as this  situation does not fall under the job refusal provisions.",38.48787755102046,15.194820861678007,17.277040344799307,20.104671201814057,18.389999999999997,14.55319727891156,66.13469387755103,10.8,3.510524529900997,1.0290412907939035,0.4235876537283405,0.052123715035122,0.9003040790557861,0.8942908598826482,5.333333333333333,4.0,3.111677952896103,29.4,28.0,9.322374518687107,1.63718820861678,1.0,0.9499374766138432,441,195,0.4421768707482993,2400,15,9.3.1.1,Claimant's health and physical capabilities,Chapter 9 - Refusal of employment
600,600,"The  extent to which the hours of work at a place of employment are compatible with  the claimant's family obligations or religious beliefs, is another criterion  used to determine what constitutes suitable employment. Specifically, the EIR 9.002(1) states, the hours of work are not incompatible  with the claimant's family obligations or religious beliefs.There is no reference in the legislation requiring a comparison of available hours of work to a claimant's previous pattern of work in the qualifying period. Consequently, with only a few exceptions, claimants are obligated to seek and accept any reasonable hours of work, including full-time, part-time, evenings, nights and shift work, as well as work that may involve inconvenient or long hours, or overtime.As  an exception, hours of work are not suitable if they are incompatible with the  claimant's family obligations. In order to avoid such an incompatible  situation, and to establish their availability for work, claimants are expected  to make arrangements for the care of family members, in order to allow them to  accept the hours of work that are available in the labour market. In some  instances, it may even be possible to make arrangements with the employer to  adjust the hours of work in order to accommodate a claimant's circumstances.  However, the fact that the employer cannot adjust the hours of work to  accommodate the claimant would not necessarily render the employment  unsuitable. It is not the employer's responsibility to adjust the hours, but  rather it is the claimant's responsibility to be willing to accept all  reasonable hours of work. Inability or unwillingness to make every attempt to make  alternate care arrangements could be an indication that an availability issue  exists. Availability is a separate issue that is considered based on all of the  circumstances of the case, and discussed in chapter  10 of this Digest.There may also be situations where certain hours of work or days of the week are incompatible with a claimant's religious beliefs. If accepting certain hours or days of work would be inconsistent with a particular religious belief or conviction, and again if it is not possible to adjust the hours or days of work, then the employment may be considered unsuitable.In  addition, there may be circumstances where certain hours or even days of work  are not suitable because one of the other criteria for determining suitability  of employment is not met. For example, a claimant may be able to work on a  part-time basis as they are physically incapable of accepting work on a  full-time basis (EIR 9.002(1)); or the  offered earnings for intermittent part-time work could be such that the  claimant would be put in a less favourable financial situation by accepting the  employment. In these circumstances the employment may not be suitable.An  offer of salary that is less than the salary last earned would not  automatically make the prospective employment unsuitable (CUB 80605).  This factor would nevertheless be taken into consideration in determining  whether there was good cause, should the employment be refused.The  fact that the employer's hours of work are incompatible with a claimant's  family obligations or religious beliefs, and that the incompatibility cannot be  resolved by the claimant, may indicate that the claimant's willingness and/or  ability to work are doubtful or that there are severe limitations on the  claimant's availability (FCA A-479-94; Digest 10.7.0).  All cases will be considered based on all of the claimant's individual circumstances.",48.65496951219514,14.11209349593496,15.710118619332857,18.60894308943089,16.530024390243902,11.432715447154472,56.60365853658537,7.95,3.222954584079967,0.7970340378361283,0.4739609891543357,0.0619968239254893,0.877920040958806,0.879562258720398,4.795121951219512,4.0,3.1746417417371577,30.75,26.5,13.79447353109208,1.5008130081300812,1.0,0.9263527515577388,615,206,0.3349593495934959,2999,20,9.3.1.2,The hours of work,Chapter 9 - Refusal of employment
601,601,"The  extent to which the nature of the work at the place of employment is contrary  to the claimant's moral convictions or religious beliefs is the third criterion  used to determine what constitutes suitable employment. Specifically, EIR 9.002(1) states,  the nature of the work is not contrary to the claimant's moral  convictions or religious beliefs.This is a criterion that is based on the claimant's personal situation and would not be based on  previous hours or pattern of work. What is considered is the individual circumstances of the claimant during the entire benefit period.When the claimant indicates that the nature of the work is contrary to their moral convictions or religious beliefs, it is the nature of the employment itself, the duties, hours, working conditions and environment that must be examined in this regard. It is only when one or more of these factors are clearly shown to be contrary to the claimant's moral convictions or religious beliefs, and that the employer is unwilling or unable to accommodate those convictions or beliefs, that the employment would be deemed unsuitable.Generally, the moral conviction or religious beliefs should be those recognized by society at large, and not something that is unsubstantiated. For example, working in a meat processing plant may be morally reprehensible to some claimants. Likewise, being required to work on a religious day of observance may be clearly contrary to the religious beliefs of some. In these instances, the moral conviction or religious belief is one that is recognized by society.However,  if the claimant's moral convictions or religious beliefs mean that a claimant  imposes significant restrictions on their ability or willingness to accept work,  this may indicate that there are more serious limitations on the claimant's  availability for work (Digest 10.7.0).",49.10119617224885,13.276339712918666,15.429909175157396,17.76507177033493,16.09311602870813,12.722368421052629,59.54425837320574,8.818181818181818,3.3495321022905973,0.7491312081121618,0.4807593906790107,0.0411147540537787,0.9072372674942016,0.8990835216310289,5.032894736842105,4.0,3.056308753945842,27.63636363636364,22.0,11.562264069516106,1.5328947368421053,1.0,0.8422851370394484,304,121,0.3980263157894737,1561,11,9.3.1.3,Moral convictions or religious beliefs,Chapter 9 - Refusal of employment

603,603,"Generally, work in an occupation that is the same or similar to work previously done by the claimant would be considered suitable. This could include one or more occupations.However, it is not only the occupation the claimant has worked in previously or the one the claimant wishes to work in at present that are necessarily relevant in determining what is suitable employment for a claimant. Rather, given the claimant's particular circumstances, what must be determined are the occupations in which the claimant is qualified to work and which include duties that are reasonable for that type of work. It is not essential that the claimant be qualified to work in a particular occupation when first hired. Rather, given the claimant's particular circumstances, what must be determined is in which occupation(s) the claimant is qualified to work, including those in which they could become qualified through on-the-job training.

604,604,"The  term prevailing rate is not contained in the legislation. It is  commonly used to refer to the rate of earnings recognized by good employers. Therefore,  employment is generally considered suitable if it is at a rate of earnings  equal to or higher than the prevailing rate (CUB 57919, CUB 80605).The prevailing rate consists of a range paid for a particular occupation. On some occasions, employment may be found unsuitable because it is paid at a rate lower than the prevailing rate. Clearly, employment is not suitable if it is at a rate of earnings lower than that provided for in a decree, ordinance or other applicable legislation. On the other hand, a rate of earnings must not be regarded as unsuitable merely because it is lower than that paid by big companies, or that recognized by unions.In this day and age, the rate of earnings and other working conditions of most employment are regulated, whether by labour agreement, by decree or by federal or provincial legislation. Employers who acknowledge their obligations and readily fulfill them should not be excluded as a good employer only because other employers offer more attractive working conditions.All claimants are expected to seek and accept suitable employment while claiming regular benefits. This may include being willing to accept employment with lower wages than initially desired or previously received. However, an offered wage that would pay less than the minimum wage in effect in the province or territory in which the work is offered, would render that employment unsuitable.",52.93327483327485,11.725545805545806,14.554592549557764,16.213548613548614,13.729059319059324,12.13853281853282,55.205686205686206,7.454545454545454,2.7403734847066223,0.634908028880581,0.4851749154848785,0.0593764282826189,0.8894421517848968,0.870146910349528,4.9652509652509655,4.0,2.9096346801214543,23.545454545454547,26.0,8.18383813449229,1.5366795366795367,1.0,0.8252799791715578,259,126,0.4864864864864865,1306,11,9.3.2.2,Prevailing rate of earnings ,Chapter 9 - Refusal of employment

This means that their union will advise them when work becomes  available through the union (Digest  10.6.4). The number of weeks during which a  claimant can restrict their job search efforts to a UHH is based on their  status with the UHH, and the number of years of experience they have in the  occupation with their union. Once the exemption period has elapsed, UHH members  are subject to the same job search requirements as non-hiring hall workers.

606,606,"A claimant, by accepting the earnings offered by an employer, should not be put  in a less favourable financial situation in comparison with the less favourable of:the financial  situation they were in while receiving benefitsthe financial  situation they were in during their qualifying periodFor  example, taking into account the claimant's EI benefits including any working  while on claim provisions, employment may not be suitable if accepting the  employment means that transportation and child care expenses are so high that  the claimant would be in a less favourable financial situation than the lesser  of what they are receiving on EI, and what they were earning during their qualifying  period.Assuming the claimant is normally entitled to $400.00 a week in EI benefits. If the claimant is offered employment earning $300.00 per week, after the working while on claim earnings of $150.00 are deducted, the claimant would receive $250.00 per week in EI benefits. However, if the claimant's transportation and child care expenses exceed $150.00 per week (or one-half of the offered earnings) the claimant could be in a less favourable financial situation by accepting the employment, therefore the employment may not be suitable.By not accepting the employment this claimant could be entitled to $400.00 in EI benefits. By accepting employment with expenses of $125.00 per week, the claimant would net $425.00 (EI benefits of $250 + $300 employment income minus expenses of $125). With net earnings of $425.00, compared to $400.00 if the employment was refused, the claimant is in a more favourable situation by accepting the employment and so the employment remains suitable.However, if there were expenses of $175.00 per week, the claimant would net a total of only $375.00 (EI benefits of $250.00, + $300.00 in employment income minus expenses of $175.00). In this latter circumstance the net income of $375.00 would be less than the $400.00 the claimant could be entitled to by not accepting the employment, thereby putting the claimant in a less favourable financial situation and making the employment possibly unsuitable.The Commission would then have to examine the financial situation the claimant was in during their qualifying period.

The concern by a worker that their inexperience could  result in injury may be well-founded, if the work could in fact be dangerous.However,  when danger is unlikely and the alleged fear appears to be more of a perception  than real, the refusal may be without good cause. Each case must be examined on  its own merits after appropriate fact-finding with both the claimant and the  employer.

613,613,"Moving  the entire family may not be desirable when the prospective employment at some  distance away is only temporary. The question then is whether it is more  reasonable to accept or refuse the offer, after considering the expenses  involved in travelling and maintaining 2 homes.It  often happens that both spouses are in the labour market. Keeping in mind the  principles applicable to voluntarily leaving employment, it will be assumed,  unless there is an indication to the contrary, that the area in which the  couple resides is the one that favours the career of one of them, a decision  they have already made and which must be respected. Acceptance of employment by  the other spouse would be influenced by these factors. When by reason of such  decision, the latter refuses to accept work at a place so far away that the  couple would be required to live apart for long periods, the refusal may be  with good cause. For example, a claimant may have good cause in refusing  permanent employment that would only allow seeing the other partner on  weekends. Generally, it is expected that spouses live together on a continuing  basis; if economic factors keep them apart, the situation must be exceptional  and the separation of a short duration (Digest 6.5.3).However,  if a couple takes up residence in an area where there are virtually no job  opportunities, they must be prepared to accept periods of separation, if either  of them, or both, intend to remain in the labour market.The legislation  does not specifically require claimants to move in order to accept suitable  employment. However, it does require claimants to: apply for and accept  suitable employment that is vacant or about to become vacant; take advantage of  any opportunity for suitable employment (EI Act 27(1)(a) and (b)); be available  for work (EI Act 18(1)); and make reasonable and customary efforts to obtain suitable  employment (EI Act 50(8)).In some occupational fields such as construction, mining, forestry, shipping, or other  specialized occupations, as well as other temporary and seasonal employment, a  claimant may be required to live apart from a spouse, children or an  established home residence for long periods of time. Living away from home is a  condition that workers in particular industries are expected to endure at  certain times (CUB 63327).  When choosing to work in these types of occupations claimants must generally  accept having to live apart from their families for rather long periods of  time, as long as they are not prevented from visiting their families at  reasonable intervals (CUB 56814, CUB 56893).In these types of situations, rather than be voluntarily unemployed, claimants are  expected to seek and accept all suitable employment opportunities that are  available in the area where their insurable employment was earned, assuming  again that by accepting any new employment in that area, they are not prevented  from visiting their families at reasonable intervals (CUB 78646, CUB 79985).  For example, a mining engineer who regularly lives apart from his family is  laid off from his employment in Saskatchewan. Given the nature of his chosen  profession, should he return to his home province, this claimant should be  willing to seek and accept all suitable employment opportunities that may arise  in Saskatchewan, as well as suitable opportunities in his home province.If immediate suitable employment is not available in Saskatchewan and the claimant  returns to his home province and the claimant would not be prevented from  visiting his family at reasonable intervals, the claimant should be willing to  return to work, if recalled to his former place of employment in Saskatchewan. The  claimant should also be willing to work in other geographical areas. A failure  to seek and accept such employment may lead to a disqualification for job  refusal, and may also raise a presumption of non-availability for work.",40.3330185758514,17.629250085999313,16.84529064763803,21.825111799105606,21.087690918472653,11.4287134502924,66.69728242174062,10.647058823529411,3.152788745151611,0.7646517375101413,0.4549097258080559,0.0386206648733867,0.8896753340959549,0.877054234345754,4.755847953216374,4.0,2.9839303058967426,40.23529411764706,28.0,29.45690653413141,1.4853801169590644,1.0,0.8505706728698005,684,252,0.3684210526315789,3278,17,9.5.3,Work away from spouse,Chapter 9 - Refusal of employment
614,614,"When the claimant has good reason to believe that an intolerable situation will occur at the prospective place of employment, namely a situation that cannot be  endured, the refusal may be with good cause. An intolerable situation is a  situation that is unusual, extreme or severe (CUB 41607).A simple inconclusive statement in this regard, is not enough. Fact-finding must be conducted with the claimant and the employer, and a determination made as to  the extent to which the work situation may have been so intolerable that a  reasonable person would not have accepted it.This may be the case where the evidence indicates that the claimant had worked for the employer previously and had been either dismissed or had quit, or when it  is established that the workplace was otherwise unsuitable. However, there may  be circumstances where the evidence shows that a reasonable person should have  accepted the employment despite the fact that the claimant did not previously  get along with the employer, the work would be at an older facility or the work  would be monotonous.",47.17100000000002,16.0208085106383,16.404322709996244,20.784680851063836,19.64228723404256,11.217659574468088,63.13191489361702,9.6,3.4802889738607155,0.543837245835439,0.4200341065983892,0.0251756353997828,0.8987968266010284,0.9249155720074972,4.72872340425532,4.0,2.8779840144317306,37.6,38.0,8.333066662399863,1.4361702127659577,1.0,0.819425209006456,188,92,0.4893617021276595,895,5,9.5.4,Place of employment,Chapter 9 - Refusal of employment
615,615,"A person has the right to become a member or refuse to join a particular  association or union of workers. This right should not be infringed upon by an  employer or a union of which the claimant is not a member. Once a person has  joined an association or union, they have the right to observe the lawful rules  of the association or union.Section 35 of the Act states:Notwithstanding  anything in this Part, no claimant is disqualified or disentitled under  sections 30 to 33 from receiving benefits only because the claimant left or  refused to accept employment if, by remaining in or accepting the employment,  the claimant would lose the rightto become or refrain from becoming a member of an association, organization or  union of workers, orto continue to be a member and to observe the lawful rules of an association,  organization or union of workers (EI Act 35)Although, upon first glance, section 35 of the legislation appears to apply to cases  where claimants refuse employment due to union pressure, this is not the case.  This right does not provide any protection against restrictions often imposed  by unions on their own members; rather, the loss of the  right referred to in section 35 is intended to apply to the loss of a legal right  related to membership in a union and observance of lawful rules. It is not intended to apply to the  application of internal union policies, by-laws, constitutions, etc. that may  result in a claimant being threatened or in fact fined or expelled from their particular union.Section 35 of the EIA  is intended to  protect the legal right of a claimant to:become (or not become) a member of an association, organization or unioncontinue to be a member and observe the lawful rulesIn other words, claimants are not disqualified for  refusing employment when accepting that employment would cause them to lose  their right to join a union, quit a union or to refuse membership in a union.Consequently,  a refusal of otherwise suitable employment is with good cause only when  acceptance of the prospective employment means the claimant would lose the  right to become a member of the union which one wishes to join, or to continue  to be a member and observe its lawful rules, or to refrain from becoming a member of the union recognized at the employer's place of business. It is up to  the claimant to show that one's rights would have been infringed upon.The  Courts have consistently held that threats or pressure exerted by a union on a  claimant to leave or refuse employment is a personal matter between the  claimant and the union.",34.48313157894738,20.249947368421054,16.647925096878797,23.71578947368421,23.27206315789473,9.73355789473684,70.23684210526315,10.8,3.1893561128102124,0.547554877378957,0.4550222447165807,0.0429736651464771,0.9225496782196893,0.9260802268981934,4.448421052631579,4.0,2.917636504104496,47.5,35.5,31.26739515853535,1.4673684210526317,1.0,0.8287520237667639,475,163,0.3431578947368421,2126,10,9.5.5,Union membership,Chapter 9 - Refusal of employment

617,617,"Claimants  have good cause for refusing an employment offer in any period during which  their self-employment in farming is not minor in extent (EIR 30(2) and 30(4)). However, because of their self-employment, such claimants are considered to be working full work weeks and are therefore not  entitled to benefits (EIR 30(1)).When  the farm is small, claimants will often say that they are willing to accept  other work during the farming off-season and sometimes even during the farming  season. In such a case, farm chores cannot be used as justification for  refusing suitable employment that would normally be acceptable by a claimant under other circumstances.Farm  operators who wish to remain in or return to the labour market must first make  the necessary arrangements that will relieve them from farming responsibilities  in the event an opportunity for employment arises. Where an offer is made for  suitable employment some distance away, but still within a reasonable commuting time, the requirement that the claimant be home at a certain time or their  inability to leave earlier in the morning would not amount to good cause for  refusing that employment (Digest 9.3.1.2).",41.82780487804882,17.610731707317075,15.381575749822971,20.887804878048783,21.58609756097561,11.587317073170729,65.39024390243902,10.0,3.707229910264167,0.6856948833214329,0.4164444696511394,0.0331074094110475,0.8709734976291656,0.868013858795166,4.780487804878049,4.0,2.850008088323578,41.0,37.0,11.882760622010355,1.4585365853658536,1.0,0.8171860133218312,205,114,0.5560975609756098,988,5,9.5.7,Farming activities,Chapter 9 - Refusal of employment

621,621,"The  assurance of obtaining better paying, full-time employment in the immediate  future may amount to good cause for refusing an offer of suitable employment.  What is required is not an absolute certainty but a reasonable assurance that  another employment will materialize as promised. There must be an actual offer  of employment, including some type of assurance, and it must come directly from  the employer. As a general rule, any statement by the claimant to this effect  should be supported by documentary evidence; the fact that one subsequently  obtained the employment within the expected time may serve as an indication  that there was a promise of employment.What  is meant by immediate future is a period of up to 4 weeks from the date the  job was offered. However, regardless of the length of time between the offer  and the start date of employment, all factors must still be considered when  determining if good cause exists for the refusal. If the other employment is not  starting immediately, the Commission would also have to examine whether or not  the claimant's availability for work is still in order (Digest  10.8.2).Situations  may occur where the claimant has accepted employment with 1 employer, but the  start date is more than 4 weeks after the date the job offer was made. Should the claimant receive an offer from  another employer prior to starting the first job, the claimant should explore  the possibility of refusing the first employer, in order to immediately put an  end to their period of unemployment. All terms and conditions of both offers would need to be reviewed before determining  whether good cause existed, if the claimant refuses the second offer.Situations  may also occur where there is an assurance of higher paying full time  self-employment in the immediate future. Again, what must be examined is  whether or not this employment will commence within 4 weeks from the date of  the job offer.A  promise of other employment of short duration or a promise of a recall to  seasonal work is not good cause to refuse an offer of employment, where the  offered employment would be of long duration. Little weight will be given to a  promise of employment if, when the time comes, the claimant does not accept  that very employment. On the other hand, good cause is not shown where  acceptance of employment offered for a short duration (for example, 2 to 3 weeks) would not jeopardize the possibility of later obtaining the desired employment.",49.34339285714289,14.326607142857146,15.6264611214528,18.78214285714285,16.080401785714287,10.128749999999997,55.88392857142857,7.642857142857143,3.2817094519229464,0.5415213267110487,0.4557893573733959,0.0426954425565156,0.8836704859366784,0.9100946386655172,4.566964285714286,4.0,2.844948166514297,32.0,27.0,11.250396818398388,1.4776785714285714,1.0,0.8288556893853903,448,168,0.375,2053,14,9.5.9.2,Promise of employment,Chapter 9 - Refusal of employment

624,624,"A  definite disqualification of not fewer than 7, and not more than 12  weeks of benefits (EI Act 27(1)(a) and (b), EI Act 28(1)(a)), will be imposed if, without good  cause, and since the interruption of earnings giving rise to the claim, a  claimant:has not applied for suitable employment that is vacant, after becoming aware that it is vacant or is becoming vacanthas failed to accept such employment after it has been offered to the claimanthas not taken advantage of an opportunity for suitable employmentThe number of weeks of disqualification will be based on all of the circumstances surrounding the refusal, and the willingness and interest shown by the  claimant, in attempting to secure employment (CUB  58114).An offhand or cavalier refusal of suitable employment may result in the maximum 12 week disqualification; a reason that is accompanied by extenuating  circumstances would generally result in less than the 12 week maximum. All  circumstances of each case must be examined in detail, to determine if  extenuating circumstances exist, and if so, to what extent they should reduce  the period of disqualification.If 1 or more of the criteria for determining suitability were present, but were not significant enough to render the employment unsuitable, a reduction in the  period of disqualification would be in order. For example: the claimant's  health was an issue, but it was not so significant that it did not allow the  claimant to commute to the place of work, and to perform the work (Digest 9.3.1.1); there were  daily expenses involving commuting to work and child care arrangements, but  they were not so high that they would have put the claimant in a less  favourable financial situation (Digest 9.3.3) by accepting  the employment; the daily commuting time to and from the place of employment  was within reason, but the total hours of the work day would have meant less  than usual time with a claimant's young family in the evening. In addition, if  the duration of the employment is 7 weeks or less, the minimum 7 week  disqualification is appropriate (EI Act 28(1)(a)). Short term work is preferable to  no work at all, so a refusal of even 1 day of suitable employment could  result in the minimum 7-week disqualification.If the duration of the employment refused is longer than 7 weeks, the length of the disqualification should not exceed the number of weeks that the  employment would have lasted, had the employment been accepted, and will never  exceed 12 weeks (EI Act 28(1)(a)). The suitability of hours of work for prospective employment is not linked to the hours the claimant worked prior to the start of their claim. With few  exceptions, claimants are obligated to seek and accept all hours of work,  including part-time and full-time work (Digest 9.3.1.2). Consequently,  the length of a disqualification is not affected by the fact that the  employment opportunity may be less than full-time. It is the suitability of the  employment opportunity itself, and the circumstances surrounding the actual  refusal, that are relevant, not the fact that the claimant may have worked  either part-time or full-time in the qualifying period.",29.83011424840869,21.67811000489636,18.821437475804725,26.21504814754365,25.814627060551658,10.988581687612209,73.07801534192916,11.363636363636363,3.698888391548616,1.0081641747180172,0.4813612426747471,0.0682672394937391,0.8700754344463348,0.8929951190948486,4.655296229802514,4.0,3.171862626983736,50.63636363636363,32.0,42.40127083702848,1.4847396768402157,1.0,0.9838190774299692,557,198,0.3554757630161579,2636,11,9.6.1,Job refusal: 7 to 12 week disqualification,Chapter 9 - Refusal of employment

As such they are to be served during weeks after the waiting  period and in weeks for which at least $1  of benefits would have been  payable if the disqualification had not been imposed (EI Act  28(2)). A week of disqualification cannot  be served if there is no entitlement to benefits in a particular week, because  of an indefinite disqualification (voluntary leaving without just cause or  dismissal due to misconduct), a disentitlement, or an allocation of earnings,  all of which would prevent the payment of any benefits.If  the event that led to the definite disqualification occurred after the start of  the benefit period, the definite disqualification will only start from the week  of that event. The length of a definite disqualification is not affected by any  subsequent loss of employment during the benefit period. If 2 definite  disqualifications are imposed, they must be served consecutively and not  concurrently (EI Act  28(2)).Any weeks  of definite disqualification not served when the claimant's benefit period  ends, shall be served in any benefit period established within 2 years after  the event that resulted in the definite disqualification (EI Act  28(3)).However,  a disqualification shall not be carried forward against a claimant who has  accumulated at least 700 hours of insurable employment, since the event giving  rise to the disqualification (EI Act  28(4)).In  addition, a definite disqualification is deferred if the claimant is otherwise  entitled to special benefits, or has been referred to a course of instruction,  or to an employment activity by the Commission or a designated authority (EI Act  28(5)).Any  week in which a definite disqualification is served is considered a week of  benefits paid, and therefore reduces the number of weeks of regular benefits potentially  payable in the benefit period (EI Act  28(6)). However, a week of definite  disqualification served will not prevent a claimant from requesting that a  benefit period established with less than 600 hours of insurable employment  (minor attachment claimant) (EI Act  6(1)) be cancelled so that a benefit  period can be established with 600 or more hours of insurable employment (major  attachment claimant) (Digest 1.2.8), to enable the claimant to qualify to receive special benefits (EI Act 28(7)).",11.0961445783133,26.43986230636833,21.703370914358928,30.846815834767643,30.775459552495697,11.868048192771084,87.23752151462995,16.571428571428573,4.049495354476527,1.294214289007129,0.4488354230191375,0.0427597332246052,0.8648160596688589,0.8117504715919495,4.790361445783133,4.0,3.649314656167428,59.285714285714285,42.0,50.87158703389289,1.6024096385542168,1.0,1.1713421303842535,415,150,0.3614457831325301,1998,7,9.6.3,Serving the disqualification,Chapter 9 - Refusal of employment
627,627,"The  primary purpose of the Employment Insurance (EI) program is to provide  temporary financial assistance to workers in case of involuntary unemployment.  Simply having paid into the plan is not sufficient in order to be entitled to  benefits (CUB  70549). A claimant must prove there are no circumstances or conditions that  exist that have the effect of disentitling or disqualifying the claimant from  receiving benefits (EI Act 49(1)(b)). There are 3 basic  requirements in the legislation, which must be met in relation to a claimant's  availability for work (CUB 75971).The  legislation states that a claimant is not entitled to be paid benefits for any  working day in a benefit period, for which the claimant fails to prove that on  that day, the claimant was:capable of and available for workunable to obtain suitable employment (EI Act 18(1)(a))In order to reinforce these 2 requirements, the  necessity to personally seek employment was explicitly added in 1971, so that  waiting passively for an offer of work is generally considered insufficient to  prove availability (CUB 72119 and CUB 75031). Consequently the Commission may  require the claimant to prove: they are making reasonable and customary efforts to obtain suitable employment       (EI Act 50(8))These requirements are directly linked to the meaning of suitable  employment. Claimants are not required to be available for and seeking  employment that is not considered suitable pursuant to section  6(4) of the EIA and EIR 9.002.The legislation includes the following specific criteria that are used to determine  whether an employment opportunity is suitable for a particular claimant (EIR 9.002):the claimant's health and physical capabilities allow them to commute to the place of work and to perform the workthe hours of work are not incompatible with the claimant's family obligations or religious convictionsthe nature of the work is not contrary to the claimant's moral convictions or religious beliefsThese criteria will apply for the duration of a claimant's benefit period, regardless  of the length of time the claimant is unemployed or the number of weeks of regular benefits the claimant receives. Other factors that are taken into  consideration when determining what constitutes suitable employment for a  claimant are, the claimant's previous occupation(s), wages, working hours and  conditions, the terms of employment, commuting times, and labour market  information.Claimants are expected to make sustained job search efforts that are directed towards obtaining suitable employment. The legislation sets out specific criteria to be considered when determining whether the efforts the claimant is making to  obtain suitable employment, are reasonable and customary. Those criteria include  9 activities that can be conducted to assist in obtaining suitable  employment (EIR 9.001(b)):assessing employment opportunitiespreparing a resume or cover letterregistering for job search tools or with electronic job banks or employment agenciesattending job search workshops or job fairsnetworkingcontacting prospective employerssubmitting job applicationsattending interviewsundergoing evaluations of competencies",15.751085020242954,23.334704453441294,21.463366851990568,28.10008097165992,28.898502024291496,15.595627530364368,85.63481781376518,17.9,3.565253978819462,0.9220889105678616,0.4823956103123343,0.0278510002154312,0.8846644560496012,0.8904869258403778,5.441295546558704,4.0,3.738355082976658,49.4,33.0,38.756160800574655,1.665991902834008,1.0,1.0759504450755726,494,215,0.4352226720647773,2706,10,10.1.0,Authority,Chapter 10 - Availability

It implies that the claimant is unable to obtain suitable employment and  sincerely wishes to return to the labour market as soon as possible, as  demonstrated by an active search for employment (EI Act 18(1)(a), EI Act 50(8)).For  the above principles to apply, an individual must first be capable of work. Being  capable of working refers to the physical strength and/or experience required to perform the duties of employment in an occupation that is considered to be  suitable under the legislation (EI Act 18(1)(a); CUB 70880, CUB 77047A).While  being available may imply that an individual sincerely wants to work, a  willingness to work is not synonymous with being available for work. Availability for work is primarily a subjective matter which must be considered in light of a claimant's intentions. This can be done by examining statements,  actions and restrictions, as well as the concern shown by an individual towards  finding employment (CUB 55457B, CUB 72881). However, it must also be viewed objectively by  examining a person's prospects of employment in relation to any restricting circumstances,  whether created deliberately or not (CUB 63214). This includes any limitations caused by partial  incapacity, transportation difficulties and personal or family constraints (CUB 70961).A  claimant is not required to accept a job which is recognized as unsuitable. To  determine if a particular employment is suitable, reference should be made to  the legislative criteria that define suitable employment (EI Act  6(4); EIR 9.002).",37.71429435483873,16.662862903225804,16.52667757954773,20.25824372759857,19.928897849462366,13.214910394265228,67.49148745519713,11.375,3.2977591036414564,0.5473229156258631,0.4836134453781512,0.0408805272300943,0.8982195343290057,0.8877772887547811,5.078853046594982,4.0,3.305401917864112,34.875,28.5,14.641016870422629,1.5806451612903225,1.0,0.8918899506807623,279,140,0.5017921146953405,1442,8,10.1.2,Availability defined,Chapter 10 - Availability

631,631,"When  a claimant fails to prove they are capable of and available for work, and unable to obtain suitable employment, the claimant is disentitled from  receiving benefits from that date until the claimant can prove that the circumstances  preventing them from being available no longer exist. This includes situations  where the claimant fails to prove they are making reasonable and customary  efforts to obtain suitable employment (EI Act 18(1)). Such a disentitlement can be imposed concurrently with  another disentitlement for a separate reason, and can also be imposed at the  same time as a disqualification.A  disentitlement for non-availability, like any other disentitlement, starts and ends on 1 of the 5 working days between Monday and Friday. Any Statutory Holiday falling between Monday and Friday is still considered to be a working  day. It is not possible to disentitle a claimant for a half-day, nor can  extenuating circumstances reduce the length of a disentitlement (EI Act 20, EIR 32; CUB 77075).Once  a condition of entitlement, such as availability for work, is not met, an indefinite disentitlement is imposed as of that working day (EI Act 50(1)). If the claimant is no longer available for work as of a  Saturday or a Sunday, then the indefinite disentitlement is imposed as of the  following Monday. For example, if a claimant leaves his home area for the  purpose of a vacation on Saturday, May 25, 2019 the indefinite disentitlement  would be imposed as of Monday, May 27, 2019.An  indefinite disentitlement can terminate only on the working day before the day the condition of entitlement is met. If the same claimant returns from his vacation and is available for work as of Wednesday, June 5, 2019, the  disentitlement would terminate on Tuesday, June 4, 2019, and benefits would  become payable as of Wednesday, June 5, 2019.A disentitlement for non-availability can also be imposed for a definite period of time if it is known when the condition resulting in disentitlement ended.No  benefits can be paid for any working day of disentitlement. If a claimant is disentitled for a day in the waiting period, one-fifth of the weekly rate of  benefit is carried forward and deducted during the first 3 weeks in which  benefits become payable (EI Act 20(1)). If the working day of disentitlement occurs after the  waiting period has been served, one-fifth of the weekly rate of benefit is  deducted from benefits payable for that week (EI Act 20(2)).A  disentitlement that covers a full week (Monday to Friday) is not considered to be a week of benefits paid and therefore does not, by itself, reduce the potential number of weeks of benefits that could be paid in a benefit period.  Any week in which at least 1 dollar is paid, counts as a week of benefits  paid, and reduces the total number of weeks potentially payable.",40.75208791208793,17.2065873015873,16.194650593361626,20.904517704517705,19.644913003663,10.51484126984127,63.57081807081807,9.615384615384617,3.301159483690545,0.6986008039382828,0.4713230756021213,0.0305329640671817,0.824088121453921,0.8483999100598422,4.60515873015873,4.0,3.171183053519888,38.76923076923077,29.0,19.28392653183493,1.498015873015873,1.0,0.9718232903591864,504,177,0.3511904761904761,2357,13,10.1.4,Imposition of and duration of disentitlement,Chapter 10 - Availability
632,632,"Entitlement  to benefits does not depend solely on the fact that one states they are  available for work, but rather on proving it (CUB  56308, CUB 70577, CUB 76016).

As  the onus of proof is on the claimant,   it is not  up to  the  Commission to   produce evidence that a   claimant is not available for work, before issuing a notice of  disentitlement.An  argument  that another person was  considered entitled to benefits in a similar situation is not relevant. If  another  claimant in a similar situation was granted benefits in error , it does not exempt other claimants from proving  their own availability for work. Similar reasoning would apply to a contention  that a claimant collected benefits the year before under identical  circumstances.

633,633,"A  claimant  who admits  not  being available for work  does  not, of course, meet the availability requirements  under the act.

The receipt of benefits depends on evidence that  the claimant is available for work, not on the reason for being unavailable.Extenuating  circumstances, the claimant's good faith, financial need,  sympathetic  situations, errors by Commission staff, or even the fact that the Commission  did not warn the claimant in advance to expand their job search,  have no impact on the  requirement of proving availability for work, nor can  it shorten the period of disentitlement (FCA A-686-93; FCA A-652-93).",45.75822448979595,16.615346938775513,14.836745963215662,19.965714285714288,19.14872448979592,9.634897959183672,62.66938775510204,9.2,3.5006744051615017,0.8900632883501324,0.5125330264432353,0.0826923204100832,0.871482640504837,0.8880339662233988,4.454081632653061,3.0,3.071085308637314,39.2,28.0,16.749925372968082,1.433673469387755,1.0,0.8272703920369836,196,106,0.5408163265306123,879,5,10.2.1,Evidence of non-availability,Chapter 10 - Availability

Such statements introduce doubts   rather than clarify a doubtful availability. An  example of such statement is that of a claimant who puts  the responsibility   of finding work on the Commission. Another example is that of a person who refuses to  disclose suitable arrangements made regarding personal or family obligations  which might prevent them from looking for work. Any  time an agent is in contact with a claimant on regular or fishing benefits, the claimant's  availability should be reaffirmed. Depending on the information the claimant provides, they may have to provide a  detailed  list of  the efforts made to find work (EIA 50(5), EIA 50(8)) and whether they have, without their own knowledge,  imposed any restrictions that may  result  in  difficulty   obtaining employment.",43.796239669421496,15.739138134592682,16.084390811093357,19.778984651711923,18.257408500590323,11.310247933884298,65.97638724911452,10.857142857142858,2.886138129001389,0.6270696023324585,0.5174299948498128,0.0367047811695612,0.8586525420347849,0.8704104781150818,4.756198347107438,4.0,3.163986202234636,34.57142857142857,29.0,16.317012531685563,1.512396694214876,1.0,0.8635473875634065,242,133,0.5495867768595041,1145,7,10.2.2,Mere statement accepted,Chapter 10 - Availability
635,635,"Presumption  of non-availability refers to the natural inference which arises from a  confirmed  fact which casts doubt on a  claimant's availability for work. Where a particular  situation may initially cast doubt on a claimant's availability,  this would not be the case where, despite the claimant's  situation,     their   actions or behaviour strongly  indicate their intent is to become  re-employed. A presumption of non-availability arises whenever the  claimant does not act as a reasonable person who is desirous of working would,  under similar circumstances. A claimant's availability is also questionable  when the reason given  for voluntarily  leaving a job appears more  of a personal  reason that affects the  employee's availability to work.An  example  would be  an employee who, after numerous years of service with the same employer,  terminates employment because of difficulties concerning baby-sitting  arrangements, but a few weeks later alleges to be again available for work  after  making  new child care arrangements.   Although a claimant in this situation may not  be disqualified for voluntarily leaving  their employment, they would be subject to a disentitlement from benefits for  failing to prove availability for work, until new child care  arrangements were made.  Once the barrier to  being available no longer exists, benefits could become payable (FCA A-479-94; FCA A-736-95; CUB 71883).On  the other hand, no such presumption arises when an employee leaves employment  by reason of poor health and contends to  still be capable  of less strenuous duties. In this case, the only issue is whether that person  may be considered capable of and available for work despite the partial  incapacity. A presumption of non-availability  or incapacity would arise if the  duties that person claims to be still capable of performing, were the  same or very similar to those  required in the employment left. In this case,   the reason given for leaving would appear incompatible with  the  leaving itself.Numerous  actions can lead to a presumption of non-availability. They may include:  voluntarily leaving employment for a reason incompatible with the concept of  being available; requesting to be laid off in lieu of another employee or  failing to make use of bumping rights (CUB 79725); requesting a leave of absence (CUB 72299) or failing to return to work upon expiry of such leave, for  any number of reasons ; moving to an area where there are no  employment opportunities, even though there was no necessity for doing so;  voluntarily retiring from employment even though there was no necessity or  desire to do so   (CUB 77508, CUB 78523). Additional  examples are: neglecting to avail oneself of an employment opportunity which  would offer valuable benefits, or refusing an offer of suitable employment (FCA A-1692-92; CUB 40393),  particularly after several months of unemployment; acting in such a way as to  deliberately get  dismissed; losing employment by reason of numerous absences due to poor health;  being in receipt of an allowance or benefit from  the employer which one would lose if employment was accepted at other premises;  giving outward signs of a person whose physical condition is greatly impaired;  making no personal efforts to find work; going away from one's place of  residence for a reason other than looking for work; attending a full-time  course of training or instruction not referred  by the Commission or delegated authority (FCA A-566-04; CUB  69536, CUB 72250, CUB 79278, CUB 80001); or not going to work while there is a labour dispute.A  mere statement that the claimant is available for work falls short of the proof  required and is never acceptable as evidence of availability where a  presumption of non-availability has arisen (CUB 75171). That presumption can of course be rebutted by more  convincing evidence. It is up to the claimant to provide plausible explanations  to that end such as providing specific details to clarify availability when  requested to do so, or demonstrate a sincere desire to work by  conducting an ongoing job search (FCA A-512-07, CUB 67165; CUB 78220, CUB 71781).",35.5239984101749,19.118362480127185,17.461283631500777,23.195548489666137,22.19165182829889,10.806378378378376,69.61049284578696,11.352941176470589,3.8133349597738913,1.834834873422728,0.4800375331121316,0.0492888593048862,0.8723738864064217,0.8723538239796956,4.640540540540541,4.0,3.039466476961488,43.52941176470589,34.0,36.38861755946869,1.502702702702703,1.0,0.8470892886618674,740,300,0.4054054054054054,3451,17,10.2.3,Presumption of non-availability,Chapter 10 - Availability

639,639,"A  person whose work permit includes a restriction that only allows them to work for  a specific employer, is not normally considered to be available to accept work,  and may be disentitled from collecting benefits. However, the simple fact that  the work permit restricts the worker to one employer is not the only factor to  be considered when determining the claimant's availability.It  is important to fact find and take all factors into consideration before  determining that a foreign worker is unavailable because their work permit  restricts their employment to one employer. Before making a determination, it  is necessary to obtain a declaration from the claimant regarding their  availability. In addition, the claimant must  agree  that once they receive an offer of employment from a new employer,  they  will  contact IRCC and apply to have the restriction on their work permit removed (CUB 63940).",43.66743396226414,15.068603773584908,15.6451,18.757735849056605,16.835094339622643,11.189937106918237,57.58616352201258,8.2,3.2883156270638336,0.476556178215558,0.4308890426089135,0.0210706290106574,0.9337983578443528,0.9206965366999308,4.748427672955975,4.0,3.079591072786517,31.8,33.0,7.467261881037788,1.5471698113207548,1.0,0.8951168238821231,159,81,0.5094339622641509,755,5,10.2.4.3,Restricted to one employer,Chapter 10 - Availability

When a claimant indicates they are available for  work, and there is no issue with the work permit, or any contradictory evidence  on file concerning the claimant's availability, entitlement to benefits must be  considered the same as for any other claimant.Once  the work permit has expired, if the claimant cannot show that they applied for  an extension prior to the expiry date, the claimant no longer has any status in  Canada. In these situations, the claimant cannot prove they are available for  work, and a disentitlement is warranted (CUB 62726).

641,641,"A  person's intentions may be determined by words and actions. Actions often speak  louder than words, and initial verbal statements  should  certainly be given more weight (FCA A-500-01; CUB 67726).In  fact, a person who is not really looking for work will not always say so.  Unwillingness to work is sometimes disguised by undue restrictions which make  it very difficult to find work and is characterized by a passive attitude  toward one's responsibility in looking for work. The circumstances surrounding  a voluntary separation from employment and a failure of claimants to   make themselves   available   for  new  job opportunities  are  other indications of non-availability, where the reasons given may appear   to be an   excuse for not wanting to work.This  type of situation becomes a question of credibility and must be decided on the  balance of probabilities. Where the claimant's actions are not  consistent  with  being available   and the statements made lack credibility, a disentitlement may be imposed. As  previously mentioned,  under the legislation, the onus of proving availability lies with the claimant (CUB 76016, CUB 77869). Proof beyond any reasonable doubt is not required, but  rather the evidence must lead the adjudicator to believe that the claimant is  available rather than tend to indicate the contrary.It  is erroneous to believe a disentitlement to benefits may not be imposed until  the claimant has turned down a suitable job offer. On the other hand, the  absence of a job refusal or good cause for not accepting an offer of suitable  employment,  would not result in a  denial of benefits.  The claimant must show  that they  are sincerely  attempting  to put an end to the period of unemployment as quickly as  possible, and that the labour market situation is unfavourable, despite one's  willingness to work, ability and skills. The best evidence that can be provided  to this end   is a detailed account of one's personal efforts  made in all areas of the labour market in which there is a reasonable hope of  obtaining suitable employment (FCA A-598-03, CUB  58986). There are no legislative provisions which govern the  number of applications that must be made, or the format to be used  for a claimant's record of job searches. The legislation only requires that a  claimant be able to prove they are making  reasonable and customary efforts to obtain suitable employment (EIA 50(8); CUB 73580, CUB 79043). Availability must be examined objectively in light of  the claimant's intentions, as shown by their efforts, and in light of the  possibilities of employment in the kind of work sought and the region where  they reside or are seeking work (CUB 76310, CUB 76450).",50.769829268292696,14.32639024390244,13.968273953766031,17.510243902439026,16.279878048780482,9.900975609756095,56.9869918699187,7.933333333333334,3.242742225274512,0.7262184235879457,0.4779115272673145,0.042374156111349,0.8587889543601445,0.8566082119941711,4.524390243902439,4.0,3.0566159475736776,32.8,32.0,11.202380699357317,1.451219512195122,1.0,0.8551960602153708,492,215,0.4369918699186992,2229,15,10.2.5,Subjective considerations,Chapter 10 - Availability
642,642,"Canadian labour market information is available through a wide variety of internet and other media sources, and details on employment opportunities can be obtained quite easily. Where the required information has not been reviewed, it is difficult to know whether reasonable employment opportunities exist. As such, a disentitlement for non-availability would be difficult to support, particularly if the claimant's expectations do not appear unreasonable (CUB 51749). A simple assumption that employment opportunities are limited to some extent since the claimant has made specific demands, is not enough to support a finding that their expectations  are  unduly limited (CUB 52209).Where  the labour market information regarding employment opportunities is inadequate  but the claimant's expectations appear very restrictive in nature, although  they might not be qualified as extreme restrictions, the claimant should be  advised that they must seek and accept employment that is consistent with the  legislative definition of suitable employment (CUB 54389). This would  include   the requirement to seek and accept less favourable earnings and occupations,  particularly if a reasonable period of  time had already been  granted to allow the claimant to restrict  their availability for  work  (CUB 70715). If the claimant disregards this advice and chooses to  neither seek nor accept such work,  assuming  there is such suitable employment available for the claimant in the labour  market, the claimant is subject to a disentitlement for non-availability (Digest 10.4.2,  Digest 10.4.3.1, Digest  10.5.1, Digest  10.6.1).Finally,  in cases where the demands appear to be unduly restrictive or cast doubt on  one's interest in seeking employment  or  their desire to find work as quickly as possible, a finding that  availability has not been proven may be proper, even in the absence of detailed  labour market information. It will be up to the claimant to remove those  limitations, and prove their availability and willingness to  work (CUB 68636, CUB 70133).The  above principles also apply to a claimant whose restrictions arise out of a  real constraint, such as personal or family obligations or lack of  transportation, rather than mere personal  restrictions.  Should the restrictions  imposed be so serious as to make  employment  opportunities virtually non-existent, then it will be up to the individual,  to find a solution that  will make it possible to accept any suitable  employment opportunity  that  may arise. Only then could they become entitled to benefits.",24.947039627039658,21.621445221445217,18.94697817629153,25.500233100233103,26.052144522144523,13.10237762237762,77.27039627039628,14.11111111111111,3.397275100648457,0.8459811941223905,0.4642567925750152,0.054955538749983,0.925497069954872,0.915477122579302,5.020979020979021,4.0,3.3382753069812723,47.66666666666666,45.0,32.20075913528886,1.578088578088578,1.0,0.9663740807517522,429,186,0.4335664335664335,2159,9,10.2.6,Objective considerations,Chapter 10 - Availability

Conversely a statement which appears to be based solely on self-interest and  which has not been supported by any action, documentary evidence or plausible  explanations, may be considered doubtful (CUB 76010).Once  notified that a statement has resulted in a disentitlement, the claimant will frequently supply another statement in an attempt to re-establish entitlement  to benefits.

645,645,"Frequently,  an individual who has been interviewed and has made a self-disentitling statement will later deny that part of the statement which led to the  disentitlement from benefits. A signed statement constitutes prima facie  evidence of its authenticity and accuracy, and even an unsigned statement must  be given greater weight than a mere subsequent denial. It is not enough to  contend that the initial statement did not reflect what one really had in mind  or that one did not understand its contents (CUB 71390, CUB 77238).The subsequent statement is even less convincing where the initial statement is simple and straightforward or unambiguous; where there are indications that it  was objectively taken; where it agrees with other facts reported or with  information obtained from another source; or where the claimant had ample  opportunity to clarify anything in it that was allegedly incorrect (CUB 65343). Unless there are extraordinary  circumstances, such as the initial statement being implausible or indications  that it was obtained under duress, the first statement retains full value in  spite of subsequent denials by the claimant.Based on these principles, any subsequent statement which clearly contradicts a prior statement or is intended to minimize the weight to be given to that prior  statement is suspect. As a general rule, a spontaneous statement made before  the individual had a detailed appreciation of the impact of that statement on  benefits, will be preferred over a statement made after that individual has  become aware of the reason benefits were denied (CUB 75121A, CUB 78284). This is simply a common sense rule  and not an absolute principle. It may be departed from as often as  circumstances warrant, for example by reason of the claimant's age, education,  cultural background or state of health.In  cases where contradictions are combined with language difficulties, a hearing impairment, or misunderstanding, it becomes even more difficult to determine which  statements represent the claimant's actual state of mind (CUB 66501). It is up to the claimant to  make any subsequent explanation plausible and credible so that prior statements  could logically be set aside. It would be even more credible if the claimant  could provide documentary evidence or show that the subsequent statement can be  supported by verifiable facts (CUB 73486).",44.4747675749943,16.02197847492558,15.429909175157396,19.5749026791848,20.129862605907952,12.735415617128464,65.31005266773529,10.545454545454543,3.3222710703558174,0.5426710976554494,0.4509241382282678,0.0548253743395477,0.8632973253726959,0.868568115764194,4.992443324937028,4.0,3.1602766395085897,36.09090909090909,30.0,19.801076855264693,1.486146095717884,1.0,0.8295150529005094,397,192,0.4836272040302267,2000,11,10.3.2,Contradictory statements,Chapter 10 - Availability

648,648,"In  order to determine whether the claimant's availability is restricted to some  extent, it is first necessary to establish a basic definition of what standard availability  is. Standard availability at any time during the benefit period is described in  the following paragraphs, in light of relevant jurisprudence.Availability  is the willingness to accept immediately, any employment opportunity, anywhere  in one's work area, by using any available means of transportation, without  demanding anything more than what is suitable under the legislation in terms of  type of work, wages or salary, hours of work and other working conditions.The  work area refers to the geographical region in which the claimant is normally  gainfully employed. It is not limited to the claimant's municipality but is  comprised of all surrounding communities to which local residents would usually  commute.It  should be pointed out that this definition does not take into account local  economic conditions or the extent to which the work area is industrialized.  These are factors which should not be used in assessing availability for work.  Rather, availability should be determined on the basis of one's willingness to  work, personal efforts to find work and any restriction which reduces chances  of finding employment (FCA A-57-96; CUB 65548, CUB 76168A, CUB 79303).Entitlement  to benefits should not be denied simply because a claimant's normal place of  residence and work is in a region of higher unemployment. Such a position would  imply that people should leave rural or isolated areas. Much to the contrary,  the current legislation provides for a longer period of benefits in cases of  claimants residing in an area of high unemployment, not a shorter period (EIA 7; EIA 12; Schedule  I; EIR 17).Finally,  it must be kept in mind that the above definition of work area is valid in  assessing a claimant's availability for work. It is not necessarily applicable  when considering a refusal of a job offer. It is possible that a  disqualification may be imposed for refusing an otherwise suitable job offer outside  one's work area, but a disentitlement for non-availability would not be imposed  based solely on this reason.",44.08071116928448,15.019240837696335,15.688483145680364,18.806631762652707,17.05027923211169,11.43874345549738,58.79668411867364,8.583333333333334,3.209981885487497,0.6887764698266181,0.4674380362526862,0.0759430484805549,0.8838297670537775,0.8810476422309875,4.790575916230367,4.0,3.278218642703323,31.83333333333333,26.5,17.859793454075056,1.5418848167539267,1.0,0.9473438244963408,382,182,0.4764397905759162,1850,12,10.4.1,Standard availability defined,Chapter 10 - Availability
649,649,"A  claimant must prove they are available on a day-by-day basis for every working  day, as prescribed in section 18(1)(a) of the EIA. Furthermore, an  unemployed person must be in a position to accept any opportunity for suitable  employment immediately, or within a very short time. This demonstrates the ongoing  concern any unemployed person must have to end a period of unemployment as soon  as possible (FCA  A-683-01, CUB  52330A).Some  individuals can be available to report for work within a few hours, whereas  others may require more time to free themselves from ongoing or occasional  constraints or obligations.If a  lengthy period of time is required before a claimant can accept an offer of  suitable employment, this may cast doubt on the claimant's actual availability.  The issue then is what period of delay is acceptable before availability becomes  questionable. Under the act, a claimant must be available on a day-to-day  basis. This implies that persons who sincerely want to work should make  arrangements so that if any opportunity for suitable employment arises, they  are able, without delay, to report for work that same day, or at the latest,  the following day (CUB  74558).However,  some employments will require the individual to be on call or available with  very little notice. In such cases, a claimant who cannot resolve the problems  which prevent the immediate acceptance of any opportunity for suitable  employment on the same day or, at the latest the following day cannot be  considered available for work.There  is no question that, during a period of availability, there may be occasional  isolated working days when a claimant devotes time to personal activities,  leaves the immediate area to visit family or friends, or fulfills civic, legal,  moral, religious or family obligations. On such occasions it must be ensured  that the claimant has remained available and could have reported for work, at  the latest, the day following an offer of employment.Obviously,  a working day devoted to personal activities cannot be considered isolated if  it happens frequently or at regular intervals. If it does, then it restricts  the claimant's overall availability. The question then becomes to what extent  this restriction affects the claimant's opportunities for employment,  considering the occupation and terms of employment. These situations will be discussed  in more detail in the next section. Generally, a claimant's availability will  not be doubted if they are absent from their area for a short period (a week or  less), and have otherwise proven their availability,  and provided they have made the necessary  arrangements to be reached without delay. The claimant must also be able to  return within 24 to 48 hours if informed of an opportunity for employment.For  example, a claimant could be occupied on an isolated occasion during a period  of availability, for several consecutive working days, as a result of  obligations, constraints or merely out of personal choice.The  question then is whether the claimant, given the circumstances, is acting as a  person who is anxious to accept every opportunity for suitable employment, as  soon as possible. A mere statement of availability may not be sufficient. The  claimant must have made specific arrangements to be reached and informed  without delay, if an opportunity for suitable employment should arise. They  must be willing and able to return from their absence or to free themselves  from obligations, and report for work within 24 hours or at the most, 48 hours.The  arrangements must be specific and credible, and must demonstrate that the  claimant can respond quickly to every opportunity for suitable employment. In  such a situation, if a claimant states they have not made or have been  prevented from making personal attempts to find work, this would raise doubts  as to the claimant's availability. The agent must determine if the length of  time the claimant indicates this situation would continue seems reasonable and still  supports their desire to find and obtain employment. Benefits may be allowed  for a short period of time in such situations. On the other hand, the  availability of a claimant who is not in a position to actively seek work for a  longer period will be in doubt.This  approach regarding immediate availability assumes that the claimant remains  available for work despite the situation. It does not apply to an individual  who, for example, takes a period of rest (CUB 76457, CUB 79725), a vacation or an unpaid leave from  an employer (CUB 72391), but who claims that such a period  of rest or leave could be interrupted at any time within 24, or at the most 48  hours, if an opportunity for suitable employment arose. Such a situation cannot  be interpreted as being synonymous with availability.It  must be emphasized that this general approach applies in many situations, some  of which are the subject of specific sections in this chapter:Digest  10.7.0 Hours of work; family obligations and religious beliefsDigest  10.11.1 Visiting family or friendsDigest  10.11.2 On vacationDigest  10.11.4 Sickness or death in familyDigest  10.11.5 Staying at the cottageDigest  10.14.5. Jury duty or court ordersDigest 10.11.8 Out of CanadaFinally,  an individual who has actually missed an opportunity for suitable employment because they were unable to respond to an employer within the time required by  the employer must demonstrate that there was a valid reason. Such a case will  be evaluated based on the principles in chapter  9 of this Digest.",54.7587217418334,12.405046625974908,13.6886701853816,15.927308692212051,14.277843901887644,10.64968463886063,54.26384650163898,7.361111111111111,3.11036313693637,1.1563097876911153,0.4441943701632869,0.0985994369680457,0.780846221106393,0.7632833622834262,4.682604272634792,4.0,3.064078713948399,27.30555555555556,24.5,15.7353449357462,1.4699898270600202,1.0,0.8407625637506394,983,312,0.3173957273652085,4633,36,10.4.1.1,Immediate availability,Chapter 10 - Availability

653,653,"If a  claimant does not place any restrictions on their availability, the question of  a reasonable period of time does not arise. The claimant's statements at the  time of their application for benefits, and throughout their bi-weekly  reporting regarding their availability can be accepted for the duration of  their benefit period. However, where the Commission becomes aware that a claimant's  availability is restricted in some way, the claimant must be advised of what is  expected of them in terms of their job search efforts and the types of work  they should be seeking.  Depending on the  severity of their restrictions, a reasonable period of time may be granted to allow  the claimant to explore the labour market and find employment within those  expectations and capabilities (CUB  70753, CUB  74362).A  determination that the chances of finding employment are limited in a particular  case is not necessarily sufficient to conclude that a claimant is not available  for work. It is the extent of the limitations that must be determined, such as the  claimant's restricted availability should be compared to the standard availability  for that type of employment, in order to assess the degree to which the chances  of finding employment are jeopardized.

654,654,"Generally,  when a reasonable period of time applies, it should be granted for a number of weeks varying from a few weeks up to a maximum of 12 weeks, depending on the  circumstances and the extent of the claimant's restrictions. This period can  then be increased or shortened depending on additional factors, including the  claimant's behaviour, which will be discussed under some of the following  headings.The  reasonable period begins with the start of the benefit period or date an  existing claim is renewed (reactivated). Any week within the benefit period, during  which the claimant is incapable of work or not available for work for any  reason, is counted as part of the reasonable period of time allowed. That is,  where a period of 12 weeks has been granted to look for work within a  claimant's restrictions, if the claimant is not capable of working at week 6 and  7, the 12-week period is not extended by 2 weeks.Where  a claimant's availability is restricted, the reasonable period of time will be  based largely on how much time has elapsed since the start of their claim and  the possibilities of the claimant obtaining employment. Given the various  factors and considerations at issue, a claimant is not expected to determine what  their own reasonable period of time ought to be or what effect this reasonable  period of time has on their entitlement to benefits.Although  the granting of a reasonable period of time is not mandatory under the act, the Commission will try, whenever possible, to inform the claimant whose  availability is restricted in some way, of the reasonable period of time  allowed to explore the labour market within their expectations and capabilities.  This will allow the claimant to make adjustments to their restrictions, to  prove availability. This would be even more appropriate in the case where the  claimant, by continuing to receive benefits, is led to believe that their  search for employment or the conditions placed on the acceptance of employment  are acceptable (CUB  70740; FCA  A-134-95).The  objective is to clearly inform claimants of their expectations and, if applicable, the reasonable period of time during which they can limit their availability  to employment within their restrictions.It  may happen that the reasonable period is about to terminate, or has already terminated when the claimant is so informed by the Commission; the claimant may  then be provided with a short period to comply with their obligation regarding  their job search. Two weeks could be allowed to enable them to correct the  situation of availability which is at issue. This period would only be given if  there is an indication that the claimant intends to broaden their availability  and to modify the conditions initially set.The  pertinent labour market information, as well as the information provided to the  claimant as to the reasonable period of time with respect to their situation,  should be clearly documented in the claimant's file. Finally, it is not a  matter of automatically accepting subsequent actions or statements by the  claimant after being informed of their responsibilities. The agent should  follow up with the claimant at a later date to ensure they fully understand and  are complying with their obligations for job search and availability. Such  actions or statements are subject to the usual rules of assessing credibility (Digest 10.3.0  to Digest 10.3.3).The  intent of providing a warning is to ensure fairness in the adjudication of EI claims, for claimants who are and continue to be capable of and available for  work. It does not apply to claimants who have no intention, possibility or  capability of accepting employment, or to claimants who have set conditions on  accepting employment that are so restrictive that they cannot reasonably expect  to find work within those restrictions. These claimants cannot be considered  available for work.Finally,  the fact that a person who is not available for work for one reason or another, has not been warned to expand their job search cannot entitle this person to benefits  or require the Commission to revisit its decision disentitling the claimant  because of unavailability (FCA  A-134-95, CUB 26680).",44.11006451612904,16.348376344086024,16.03029750255766,20.36387096774194,19.30193548387097,11.033978494623655,62.73763440860216,9.5,3.132172005425725,0.6819130290725867,0.4901212171406481,0.0384558578736389,0.8990303874015808,0.9022105601098802,4.698924731182796,4.0,3.0437135857672395,37.2,37.5,15.673544589530474,1.4771505376344083,1.0,0.8563579098785384,744,257,0.3454301075268817,3513,20,10.4.2.1,Length of reasonable period,Chapter 10 - Availability
655,655,"Restrictions  fall into 2 categories depending on whether they are voluntary or  involuntary. A voluntary restriction consists of a demand arising out of one's  own choice, while an involuntary restriction is a constraint over which the  individual has little control. Both types of restrictions must be taken into  account when determining a claimant's availability for work (CUB 75825).Whether  they are voluntary or involuntary, restrictions have the same effect in that  they reduce the chances of obtaining employment. However, looked at in another  way, voluntary restrictions are clearly different from involuntary restrictions.  Voluntary restrictions generally cast doubt on the claimant's eagerness to find  work, while involuntary restrictions may exist regardless of the claimant's desire  or need to obtain employment. This distinction may support the view that in  principle, a longer reasonable period of time may be allowed in the case of an  involuntary restriction.",42.1565384615385,13.83846153846154,16.92669308720184,19.374358974358977,16.32769230769231,13.96923076923077,59.33333333333333,8.666666666666666,3.0059189902656325,0.6527815822785962,0.5105750678289245,0.0403926298969095,0.8374571919441223,0.8500751405954361,5.256410256410256,4.0,3.5079978124569147,26.0,28.0,8.524474568362947,1.6346153846153846,1.0,0.9546548474249904,156,89,0.5705128205128205,828,6,10.4.3,Restrictions,Chapter 10 - Availability
656,656,"When  considering a claimant's restrictions, the first question is whether the expectations  are clearly restrictions or just preferences. It is quite normal for an  unemployed person to be more interested in and to prefer employment in the same  occupation in which they previously worked, and which would pay as high a wage  as possible. Such interest should not necessarily be construed as a  restriction.Restrictions  of a voluntary nature generally relate to type of work, wages or salary, hours  of work, commuting distance and the type of industry involved. These  restrictions are detailed later on in this chapter. Once the restrictions have  been clearly identified and the extent of a claimant's availability has been  determined, the chances of obtaining employment within those restrictions will  be assessed as accurately as possible.",55.91333333333334,11.340000000000003,14.790194502661404,16.50892018779343,13.754319248826292,12.10084507042253,53.24413145539906,7.0,2.8535183950657093,0.7768113399307346,0.4324622581301676,0.0740345503492181,0.8103933334350586,0.8190630376338959,4.957746478873239,4.0,3.3354122988519235,23.666666666666668,23.5,11.070481270277076,1.5,1.0,0.8619499675032614,142,86,0.6056338028169014,708,6,10.4.3.1,Voluntary restrictions,Chapter 10 - Availability

In this case, it is important  to obtain information concerning the prevailing rates of pay in the area where  work is being sought, as well as concerning the occupation the claimant is  prepared to accept.If a  claimant restricts their availability for work to a level of earnings that is  not within the prevailing wage rate in the claimant's area of work, for the  type of work being sought, they will be disentitled from regular benefits until  those  restrictions are  removed  if: this is an actual restriction and not just a preference (Digest 10.4.3.1)they have been warned that such a restriction is unacceptable (Digest 10.4.2)they are unwilling to change their expectations",43.96538461538464,16.815726495726498,17.122413403193683,21.753846153846155,20.09025641025641,10.93128205128205,64.21367521367522,9.833333333333334,3.3512224137512288,0.507027042968507,0.4512427340381816,0.0451765489859975,0.8975944995880127,0.8721959143877029,4.675213675213676,4.0,3.069923186847893,39.0,31.0,20.256686138984666,1.4572649572649572,1.0,0.8219027579177851,234,111,0.4743589743589743,1090,6,10.5.0,Earnings,Chapter 10 - Availability
660,660,"In response to  a question  regarding the level of earnings a claimant is prepared to accept, it is  not uncommon for a claimant  to  respond by specifying earnings that are consistent with or close to past  experience and qualifications. One should avoid drawing hasty conclusions from an answer to such a question. This  does not necessarily mean that the claimant is imposing an absolute restriction  and will not accept anything less (Digest 10.4.3.1). It is quite normal for a person to look for gainful  employment and start with high expectations, leaving room for later  concessions.Similarly,  in an effort to reply to direct and specific questions on a form or  questionnaire, or to give the information within the limited space provided, a  person may not have had the opportunity to clarify what appears to be a  somewhat definite and  firm answer.Personal  efforts made to obtain employment at a lower level of earnings, or the  acceptance of employment at a lower  wage,  may be an indication that the  wage originally  specified was a preference rather than a restriction.As  indicated in section 10.4.2 of this Digest, the Commission will continue its long-standing  practice of warning claimants whose availability may be restricted in some way, of  the implications of those restrictions. Depending on the  severity of those restrictions, a reasonable period of time to look  for work within those restrictions may be granted. The claimant  will be advised of the specific period  of time, if  any, during which they may restrict their availability to within  their expectations, and that once that period ends, they will be expected  to remove their restrictions.

If they  continue to  insist   on a rate of pay as high as  their last  employment, this will generally be considered  unreasonable.

In fact, a restriction to a rate of pay which one has no reasonable hope of obtaining could imply that one  has little or no  interest in becoming re-employed.  In these cases, a disentitlement would be imposed from the start date of the benefit period, if the claimant was not willing to remove the restriction.For example, where a claimant who is restricting to their previous wage after leaving employment in an industrial city to move to an area where the wage rates are much lower; a claimant retired from employment which paid the highest rates in the area; a claimant is seeking employment following a lay-off from seasonal employment, and expects a rate which they have no chance of obtaining during the off-season; a  claimant left highly paid employment in a line of work so limited or specialized  that there are no other such opportunities in the area (CUB 51724).",43.48630414746548,17.97563133640553,16.647925096878797,22.521290322580644,21.43244239631337,9.937327188940092,66.44147465437788,10.0,3.465447014412532,0.6652715032695817,0.4905549624859969,0.0529997745650511,0.9085898101329803,0.9204012950261434,4.493087557603687,4.0,2.8400035952274947,43.4,33.0,28.63983240174425,1.4101382488479262,1.0,0.8103526451235193,217,112,0.5161290322580645,987,5,10.5.3,Exceptions,Chapter 10 - Availability

Claimants who are granted a reasonable period of time to look  for work within restrictions will be  required  to expand their willingness to seek and accept  any  type  of suitable employment   at the end of that  period.The fact remains that a restriction as to the type of work the claimant is willing  to seek or accept cannot continue  indefinitely, regardless of the size of the geographical area in  which  a claimant is  prepared to accept work (CUB  70753, CUB  76801). Provided their  restrictions are reasonable,  claimants  will  be granted a  reasonable period of time from the start of their claim, to  restrict their job search. In the event of a renewal or subsequent claim, if the  claimant has not worked, or worked very briefly,  since the beginning of their  benefit  period, the reasonable period  of time  will not  start over.The fact that a claimant has been unable to secure employment by the end of the reasonable period of time to restrict their availability  is a significant indicator of the  likelihood of   finding  work  within their restrictions (CUB  51724, CUB  71023). Claimants should not be content to remain unemployed  and must expand their willingness to work to include other occupations which  would increase the short-term possibilities of obtaining employment. At  the end of the reasonable period of time,  claimants   must be  prepared to  immediately accept any  employment for which they are suited by skills, training or aptitudes. However,  the refusal to consider employment opportunities in a particular occupation is  not in itself conclusive. What is relevant is not so much the types  of work a person is not willing to   accept, but rather what they will accept, so as to assess the actual  possibilities of obtaining employment.The question to determine is whether the restrictions imposed concerning the type of work the claimant will accept seriously jeopardize their chances  of obtaining employment in the near future.

To establish their availability for work,  claimants are expected to make every effort to remove barriers to accepting  work, such as family obligations and other personal responsibilities, so that  they are able to seek and accept the hours of work that are available in the  labour market (FCA A-250-11, CUB  76930). Other than situations where a claimant is unable to work certain  hours or days of the week because of their religious beliefs, the claimant must  still be available for all other hours of work. In some instances, it may be  possible for claimants to make arrangements with employers to adjust the hours  of work in order to accommodate the claimant's family obligations, personal  responsibilities or religious beliefs. Claimants are expected to try and make  these arrangements before determining that the hours of work for certain types  of employment are not suitable.Claimants  who have not attempted to make arrangements to free themselves of family  obligations or other personal responsibilities to allow them to seek and accept  all available hours of work, may not be able to prove they are available for  work (CUB 63006A, CUB 72532).",43.245636363636365,15.972090909090912,15.903189008614271,19.761818181818185,18.863636363636367,11.689999999999998,61.33636363636364,9.2,3.3532540456951585,0.4676935473989078,0.5020912442200622,0.0313874663909063,0.8965300387806363,0.909467302262783,4.818181818181818,4.0,3.1669294511814328,35.2,36.0,11.285388783732706,1.5113636363636365,1.0,0.9138370426371802,352,124,0.3522727272727273,1710,10,10.7.1,The legislative requirements,Chapter 10 - Availability
671,671,"There  is no reference in the legislation to hours of work in relation to a claimant's  previous pattern of work in the qualifying period. In addition, the criteria  related to hours of work, in the legislation, is not based on the length of  time a claimant has been unemployed or receiving benefits (EIR 9.002(b)).Consequently,  notwithstanding any pattern of work in the qualifying period, claimants may not  restrict their willingness to work to only certain hours of the day or days of  the week. Rather, from the beginning of their claim they are obligated to be  available for, and must seek and accept, all hours of suitable work that are  available in the labour market. This may include full-time, part-time,  evenings, nights and shift work, as well as work that may involve inconvenient  or long hours, or overtime. The fact that a claimant is not willing or  available to work certain hours does not necessarily render employment that is  otherwise suitable, unsuitable.

672,672,"What  must be examined are the claimant's individual circumstances. Is the claimant  avoiding otherwise suitable employment because of an unwillingness to work  certain hours? If so, a disentitlement may be in order.For  example, a claimant seeking work as an accountant or high school teacher would  not be considered to be limiting their chances of obtaining suitable employment  if they are unwilling to work evenings, where there are limited opportunities  for such work in the evenings.A  claimant who is seeking work as a nurse as well as work in similar occupations,  but is unwilling to work at night for personal reasons, could be considered to  be limiting their chances of obtaining suitable employment by imposing such a  restriction. A disentitlement for non-availability could be in order, in this  scenario. However, if such a claimant has family obligations that are in fact  incompatible with working at night, and the claimant is unable to make arrangements  regarding those obligations, then nightshift work would not be suitable, and  the claimant would not be obligated to seek or accept such work. The onus of  proving availability is on the claimant. Therefore, in order to be considered available  for work the claimant would need to establish that they are available for work  in the labour market under conditions that afford reasonable opportunities for  re-employment. As such the claimant would need to be available for work as a  nurse as well as in other occupations outside of nightshift work.A  claimant who was previously employed as a teacher and who is seeking work as a  teacher, as well as any other occupation in which they are qualified to work,  would be considered unavailable for suitable employment if they are unwilling  to work mornings. A disentitlement for non-availability could be in order for  imposing such a restriction. However, if this claimant can prove that they have  family obligations that are in fact incompatible with working mornings, and  they are unable to change those obligations, then opportunities for work that  include hours in the morning would not be suitable, and the claimant would not  be obligated to either seek or accept such work. In order to be considered  available for work, the claimant would need to establish that they are  available for work in the labour market under conditions where reasonable  opportunities for re-employment exist. As such the claimant could be available  for work as a teacher, but would also need to be available in other occupations  during other hours.Each  of these cases must be examined on its own merits. What must be considered is  whether the claimant is placing a restriction on their availability, or if they  simply prefer certain hours, and the extent to which the claimant's family  responsibilities are in fact incompatible with certain hours of work. Labour  market information should be considered in these cases, particularly if the  evidence is unclear as to the availability of suitable employment during  certain hours. This will assist in deciding if the claimant is avoiding  suitable employment by restricting their hours of work, or if the conditions  under which the claimant is willing to work afford reasonable opportunities for  re-employment. As well, the extent of any restrictions and whether there exist  opportunities for work within those restrictions, will determine whether a  reasonable period of time should be granted to allow the claimant to find work  within those restrictions.",49.46342508143326,13.986908794788274,14.410869940926824,17.3614332247557,16.311677524429967,11.189771986970683,57.73583061889251,8.3,2.9973728810977742,0.8043901391053118,0.4766589406715413,0.0371711038096104,0.857589348366386,0.8676551745997535,4.754071661237785,4.0,3.162757842058589,30.7,32.0,15.80221503460828,1.49185667752443,1.0,0.9001079227616414,614,157,0.255700325732899,2926,20,10.7.3,Application,Chapter 10 - Availability
673,673,"Claimants requesting regular benefits who are  unwilling or unable to accept any work on certain working days of the week (as  opposed to just hours) because of family obligations, personal responsibilities  or other circumstances may be subject to a disentitlement for non-availability.For example, a person claiming regular benefits  may be obligated to care for a family member on a Thursday and Friday for a week or 2, and is unable to make arrangements to free themselves from those  obligations. The basic availability requirements of the legislation require  that the claimant be available for work on every working day from Monday to  Friday (EIA 18(1)( a); EIR 32). Consequently, this claimant may be  disentitled for non-availability for those days (EIA 20). However, should the condition no longer  be temporary and continue beyond that short period, an indefinite  disentitlement would apply until they are able to free themselves of those  family obligations and are able to accept work. As previously stated, each case  must be examined on its own merits.In addition, the claimant may also be subject to a 7 to 12 week disqualification if they fail to apply for, accept, or take  advantage of an otherwise suitable employment opportunity that includes working  on a Thursday or Friday (EIA 27(1)(a) and (b); Digest 9.1.0).A claimant who has been in receipt of sickness benefits and who is then capable of working, but for less than 5 days per week would not be able to establish entitlement to regular benefits for all 5 working days in that week. For example, a claimant who has received less than the maximum weeks of sickness benefits may recover to the extent that they can now work, but for only 3 days a week. If the claimant has met the conditions of entitlement to sickness benefits for the other 2 days of the week, they would not be entitled to regular benefits but would be entitled to their remaining weeks of sickness benefits, up to the  maximum weeks of entitlement in their benefit period  (Digest 11).A claimant who has already received the maximum weeks of sickness benefits but has recovered to the extent that they can now  work, but for only 3 days per week, could receive regular benefits but would be  subject to a disentitlement for the 2 days they are incapable of working each  week.Before considering a disentitlement for only  part of a week the underlying condition as to why the claimant is unable to  seek and accept suitable employment for the entire week must be closely  examined. A disentitlement for only part of the week would be appropriate only  when the underlying condition is due to incapacity, or when the condition is  only temporary, for 1 or 2 weeks, and the claimant has proven availability for  work for the other working days of the week. In many situations the underlying  condition that led to the claimant avoiding suitable employment is continuing,  in which case an indefinite disentitlement would be appropriate. As mentioned  above a claimant who does not have child care arrangements in place for 2 of  the 5 working days each week is subject to an indefinite disentitlement as this  is a self-imposed restriction which affects their overall availability for work  and likelihood of finding suitable employment.Claimants attending non-referred courses of  instruction may also claim they are available for work on days they do not  attend classes. The underlying condition that led to the non-availability, in  other words, the claimant's attendance at a course of instruction, continues  even though the claimant may not be attending classes on a particular day; in  fact, it continues until the course is either completed or abandoned. These  situations must first be examined in light of the principles in section 10.12.0 of this Digest. Claimants attending a non-referred course  must rebut a strong presumption of non-availability during the period of the  course. Attendance at classes is only one of many factors that must be  examined. If the claimant has not completed or left the course the  disentitlement for non-availability will be for the entire week even though the  claimant may not be required to attend classes on one or more days each week.  In addition, claimants who refuse to apply for, accept, or take advantage of a  suitable employment opportunity because of attendance at a non-referred course  of instruction may be subject to a seven to twelve week disqualification (Digest 9.6.0).",41.12756329113927,17.33575949367089,16.404322709996244,21.26835443037975,20.21255696202532,10.781468354430377,65.70253164556962,10.35,3.4545524600529305,0.7100916897307329,0.4414678269537327,0.0412849403756186,0.8675250285550168,0.8451536761389838,4.648101265822785,4.0,3.071339985446243,39.5,38.0,23.31201407000262,1.4848101265822784,1.0,0.91632018719827,790,231,0.2924050632911392,3705,20,10.7.4.1,Not available for a working day,Chapter 10 - Availability
674,674,"Claimants  who are available for work every day from Monday to Friday, but  on a part time basis only, are subject to the  same conditions.

Again what must be examined  is whether or not the claimant is avoiding otherwise suitable employment by  restricting the hours they are willing to work to less than a full day of work.  A disentitlement for part of a working day is not possible under the  legislation. Consequently, if a claimant is avoiding otherwise suitable  employment because they are not available for full time work, a disentitlement  for non-availability may be appropriate for the entire week.For  example, a claimant restricting to part time work, mornings each day (Monday to  Friday) may be subject to a disentitlement for the entire week. If this is an  actual restriction or if there is a lack of effort on the claimant's part to  look for and accept other hours of work, and there is a strong likelihood that  otherwise suitable employment opportunities would be available during other  hours of the day, the claimant would not be considered available for work, and  a disentitlement for the entire week may be appropriate.",52.58146897810221,14.433923357664238,13.624085052395262,17.64160583941606,16.752481751824817,9.624087591240873,56.14781021897811,7.5,3.5302956456125303,0.8027086133509889,0.464407142524028,0.0383895347580961,0.8622543641499111,0.8723099331061045,4.470802919708029,4.0,3.0436402663009323,34.25,30.0,15.57040461902002,1.4124087591240877,1.0,0.8423069863139868,274,104,0.3795620437956204,1238,8,10.7.4.2,Available for each working day but not full-time,Chapter 10 - Availability

Consequently, if a claimant is unable to work for one of those reasons on one  or more of the working days between Monday and Friday, the claimant may still  be entitled to benefits for those days.

676,676,"As a  general rule, working part-time while receiving benefits should not be seen as  an obstacle to full-time availability for work since the acceptance of any type  of employment is the best evidence that can be used to prove availability. The  fact that a claimant is working part time does not necessarily mean they are  imposing an undue restriction on their availability. Rather, the acceptance of  an offer of part time work usually indicates the person is in fact available  for work, at least to the extent required by the part-time job. Nevertheless,  the 3 following situations should be distinguished:the claimant considers part-time employment sufficient and would be unwilling to work more hours or days per weekthe claimant is prepared to leave the current part-time job to accept a full-time positionthe claimant is limiting availability to a second part-time job which, with the current one, would amount to a full work weekIn  the first case, the claimant is considered to be employed to the fullest extent  of their availability and is avoiding other suitable employment, therefore, a  disentitlement would apply for the entire week (CUB 73957, CUB 78294).In  the second case the claimant's willingness to abandon their part time  employment in favour of full time work, establishes the claimant's availability  for work in general. However, the claimant could be asked to provide proof that  they are making reasonable and customary efforts to obtain suitable full time  employment.In  the third case the claimant cannot avoid otherwise suitable employment, because  it is full time. Assuming there is suitable full time employment in the labour  market for the claimant, a disentitlement for non-availability would be  appropriate if the claimant insists on such a restriction.However,  claimants who refuse to accept a full-time job may still be able to prove they  are available for work, if they have good reasons to believe their current job  will become full-time in the near future.

678,678,"Where  an employee has accumulated several years of seniority with one employer it is natural to want to retain those rights and to limit their availability to work  that will allow them to return to their former employer as soon as a recall  occurs. It is reasonable for a person to consider the promised recall as the best  opportunity to obtain suitable employment in the short term, and to act  accordingly. Informing a potential employer of the possibility of recall to a  previous employer, at the risk of losing out on a job opportunity does not necessarily  mean that the claimant deliberately prevented a potential offer of employment.However, claimants cannot restrict their re-employment to only their former employer if there are other suitable permanent or temporary employment opportunities  available in the labour market. To do so would impact negatively on employers  who contribute to the fund and who require workers on either a permanent or  temporary basis. Generally then, claimants must be willing to seek and accept  all permanent and temporary work with other employers as long as the employment  is suitable (EI Act 6(4); EIR 9.002(1)).Employees sometimes request that their employer lay them off instead of other employees with less seniority or, they may request that their recall date be delayed (CUB 66701, CUB 66926A). Such request is evidence that one  may not be available for work. It would also be reasonable to conclude that  claimants in this situation do not prove that, within the meaning of the  legislation, they are unable to obtain suitable employment (EI Act 18(1)(a); CUB 78616).",41.69071428571428,16.139285714285716,16.975882523387877,20.714285714285715,18.560250000000003,11.431285714285714,61.785714285714285,9.375,3.674873515595677,0.8099064067872194,0.4301680425338864,0.0827366109424404,0.8680650421551296,0.8722964922587076,4.775,4.0,3.0064365475236148,35.0,32.5,13.573871960498227,1.5321428571428573,1.0,0.8571354166343726,280,141,0.5035714285714286,1348,8,10.8.1,Lay-offs from work,Chapter 10 - Availability
679,679,"There is no reason to believe that workers who are laid off for a short period of time are not available for work during the lay-off. However, like all other  individuals claiming regular benefits, claimants who have been laid off from  work, even for a short period of time, and even with a promise of either a  recall with their former employer or employment with a new employer, must be  willing to seek and accept suitable employment elsewhere. There are several  criteria that are used to determine whether an employment opportunity is  suitable (EI Act 6(4); EIR 9.002(1)).Assuming employment that  meets those criteria is available, claimants who have an assurance of either  returning to work with their former employer or of starting work with a new  employer in the near future, must be willing to seek and accept suitable  temporary work in the meantime. In addition, such claimants must continue to be  willing to seek and accept suitable temporary or permanent work elsewhere until  they are scheduled to return to their former employer or start the new  employment.In this regard what is required is not an absolute certainty, but a reasonable assurance that the recall or other employment will materialize as promised.  There must be an actual offer of re-employment or new employment, including  some type of assurance, which must come directly from the employer (FCA A-104-07, CUB 67542; FCA A-123-03). Any statement by the claimant to this effect may have to be supported by documentary evidence; the fact that one subsequently started the employment within the expected time is a strong indication that there was a promise of employment. This does not mean that claimants who have a definite job to go to shortly are exempted from proving  that they continue to be available for work.Claimants  who admit that they are not available for or seeking other work while awaiting  a recall or waiting to start other work cannot of course be said to be  available for work. The same is true of claimants who are not prepared to  consider job opportunities that may arise during the lay-off as they wish to remain  exclusively available to their former employer.If the lay-off period is expected to be for an extended period of time, it is reasonable to assume that a claimant will have a better chance of obtaining  temporary employment if they are fully available for and willing to accept any  suitable employment. Thus, depending on the opportunities that exist in the  claimant's area and the expected duration of the lay-off, claimants in this  situation may be required to show that they continue to make efforts to find  temporary work. Availability is not proven when a claimant imposes so many restrictions that it becomes almost impossible to obtain a temporary job.As with any situation where a claimant may be restricting their availability in any way, what must be considered is whether the claimant is placing an actual  restriction on their availability, or if they simply prefer temporary or  permanent work, as evidenced by their job search efforts. Labour market  information should be considered in these cases, particularly if the evidence  is unclear as to the availability of suitable employment under the conditions  the claimant has imposed upon themselves. This will assist in deciding if the claimant is avoiding suitable employment or if the conditions under which the claimant is willing to work afford reasonable opportunities for re-employment.",43.73622596153847,16.64584185761048,16.14049887271926,20.708715220949266,19.77222790507365,11.02527004909983,64.53774549918167,10.0625,3.5912226805389653,0.877063727739478,0.4309185903998975,0.0387091214333938,0.8947480122248331,0.8792409258229392,4.693944353518821,4.0,2.903738657322572,38.1875,35.5,12.420843117518231,1.469721767594108,1.0,0.8072805501064556,611,216,0.353518821603928,2889,16,10.8.2,Definite recall date,Chapter 10 - Availability
680,680,"Individuals  who regularly work in seasonal employment cannot be considered available for work during the off-season if they impose restrictions which make their  employment opportunities virtually non-existent. They cannot simply resign  themselves to being unemployed at the same time every year and not be prepared  to consider employment opportunities at premises or in occupations other than  with their seasonal employer (CUB 70183, CUB 77898A, CUB 78185).It  is in fact unjustifiable for workers in seasonal employment to find  satisfaction in a limited number of months of work each year and to resign  themselves to being unemployed at other times.Claimants cannot restrict their re-employment to only their former employer if there are other suitable permanent or temporary employment opportunities available in the  labour market (CUB 64656). To do so would impact negatively  on other employers who are contributing to the fund and who may require workers  on either a permanent or temporary basis.Claimants are expected to seek and accept all permanent and temporary work with other employers as long as employment with those other employers is suitable under  the EIA and Regulations.Should  another employment opportunity arise which would impact the claimant's return  to work for their seasonal employer at the beginning of the season, the  decision as to which job to choose should be made with consideration given to  which employment would likely reduce the number of months of unemployment each  year.The  above principles apply equally to those workers in the education field who  become unemployed every year, at regular periods throughout the year.",33.01811387900358,18.62656837824098,18.3970566412798,23.174580579562782,22.14114387391968,12.799857651245553,66.83324860193187,10.714285714285714,3.3656107048027977,0.4923861076002835,0.4585080038170245,0.0537981745869298,0.9058502813180288,0.889297604560852,4.98932384341637,4.0,3.0435556862673203,40.142857142857146,31.0,18.090475563744835,1.5729537366548043,1.0,0.9370857536018116,281,129,0.4590747330960854,1402,7,10.8.3,Seasonal workers,Chapter 10 - Availability
681,681,"Claimants  who have filed a grievance against their former employer on the ground that they were wrongfully dismissed must prove they are available for work in the same  way as workers who are laid off temporarily (Digest 10.8.1).Availability for work is clearly not shown where the union, in order not to weaken its stand, has instructed the individual not to take other work, pending hearing of  their case. The same is true for claimants who decide on their own not to look  for other employment opportunities while awaiting the outcome of their case (FCA A-855-97), particularly if they neglect to  avail themselves of such opportunities. A contention that the grievance action and the resulting proceedings can be likened to efforts to find work is not reasonable (CUB 52534). A claimant should not simply wait for the results, but should also make efforts that will increase the chances of obtaining employment in the interval.On the other hand, should these claimants be requested to appear in court for a few days in connection with the hearing of their case, they would not be  considered unavailable for work on those days. The very reason for being there  would be their effort to be reinstated in their former employment, and  therefore considered as part of their overall efforts to become re-employed.Where a claimant has been suspended from their duties for a specific period of time following disciplinary action, their availability for work may be examined in  the same way as laid-off workers who have a definite recall date (Digest 10.8.2).

The prospects of re-employment must be  assessed as well as the aggressiveness shown in looking for employment.Claimants in this situation do not prove they are available for work if they add other restrictions which further reduce their prospects of employment, and  particularly so if an individual has left employment or has refused to accept  an opportunity of temporary work because of that additional restriction, (CUB 67310, CUB 74393, CUB 79266, CUB 79500).In another scenario, a claimant may plan to start a business on a specific date and, for this reason, not be available for other work beyond that point in  time.

684,684,"In  metropolitan centres, a fair number of employment opportunities are located in the downtown area. Therefore, chances of obtaining employment in the short term  may be largely reduced if a claimant is not prepared to accept a reasonable  travel time from home to the core of the city. Unless unavoidable circumstances  make it  impossible for a  claimant to commute to a potential work location, their   unwillingness to accept work  downtown may  raise doubt  as  to their  sincere desire  to obtain work.On  the other hand, suburban areas may also offer many employment opportunities. In cases where claimants restrict their willingness to accept work to a specific  area of the city, a determination must be made regarding the extent to which  the likelihood of obtaining employment is reduced (CUB  46313, CUB  57048).A  reasonable period of time to find work may be allowed to claimants who are initially restricting their job search efforts or availability to the type of  work, wages and other conditions of their previous employment,  including commuting time. This will depend on the claimant's  occupation and whether they have   a reasonable chance of finding work within their restrictions. Whether  the claimant would be willing to remove their restrictions at  the end of a reasonable period of time would also be a factor in determining  whether a reasonable period of time  should be granted at all (CUB  75112). At the end of a reasonable period of time, if allowed, claimants will be required to lower their expectations or they could be disentitled from further benefits.Even  claimants whose recent employment was in the downtown area, and who no longer wish to accept work in that specific area may be allowed a reasonable period to  look for work in other parts of the city. A reasonable period of time to  exclude employment in the downtown core or to restrict their  job search efforts or availability to the type of work, wages and other  conditions of their previous employment will not be granted if  there are no suitable employment opportunities in the part of the city in which  the claimant is seeking work.An  unwillingness to consider employment opportunities outside the greater area of the city or in the surrounding communities is a restriction. However, as long  as the claimant has a realistic chance of finding employment within their  restrictions a reasonable period of time will be allowed. The inability to find  work after a lengthy period of unemployment, in an occupation in which there  are many opportunities, may be an indication that the claimant has either  imposed restrictions which negate the chances of obtaining such work, or is not   making sufficient efforts to find work.Claimants  who reside in neighboring communities are expected to make themselves available for work in the city, and be prepared to commute daily according to  the normal methods of commuting within their  community. It is the responsibility of those who do not have access to a car or  to public transportation to attempt to arrange transportation that would allow  them to accept suitable employment in an area within a normal commuting  distance (CUB  46313).",42.98546031746034,16.65429276895944,16.239406708845525,20.693192239858902,19.425079365079363,10.825820105820108,63.72592592592592,9.8,3.276964461425573,0.5568897465875468,0.4567771741695808,0.061664963055405,0.9058778967176164,0.8857210645308862,4.661375661375661,4.0,3.144095029939653,37.8,36.0,17.997036793131624,1.4832451499118169,1.0,0.8724580905669341,567,188,0.3315696649029982,2630,15,10.9.1,Urban communities,Chapter 10 - Availability
685,685,"In  order to be considered available for work, claimants residing in a rural area are not expected to move from the area where they have always lived, in order  to look for work in more urban areas.

Living away from home is a  condition that workers in some industries must endure at certain times.

693,693,"Claimants cannot be considered capable of work if they say they are physically unable to work, or if they are in fact unable to work. In this situation, the question to  decide is whether the claimant may be entitlement to sickness benefits  (CUB 70774, CUB 73094). This subject is covered in chapter 11 of this Digest.Claimants are considered physically unable to work when their inability is such that it rules out almost any possibility of obtaining employment in an occupation that  is considered to be otherwise suitable, pursuant to the legislation (EIR 40(4)). Every situation must be  examined based on the claimant's individual circumstances.If the claimant's health and physical condition prevents the possibility of obtaining employment in the same type of occupation in which they worked in  their qualifying period, and the claimant is unwilling to accept other types of  work, the claimant would be considered unable to work, and the question to  consider would be whether or not they may be entitled to sickness benefits.  However, if a claimant in this situation is willing to accept other types of  work, assuming there are reasonable opportunities for such employment in the  labour market, the claimant would be considered available for and capable of  work, and would be entitled to regular benefits.A worker who is away from work temporarily due to illness or injury, may still be capable of performing less strenuous tasks. However, such a job attached  claimant would nevertheless be considered physically unable to work if there is  little or no chance of finding suitable work within their restrictions during  their recovery and until they resume their employment.Claimants who have received the maximum number of weeks that can be paid as sickness benefits, cannot subsequently claim regular benefits by saying that they are  now capable of and available for work, unless their physical condition has  clearly improved. It is not possible that one's physical condition can support  a finding of incapability as well as a finding of capability (FCA  A-179-13).It is also possible for claimants to prove incapacity with respect to a limited number of working days in a week, and be capable of and available for work on  the other working days. Since incapacity as well as availability for work must  be given consideration on a day-to-day basis, this situation may be acceptable  (EIA 18). Incapacity for less than the 5 working  days in a particular week would not affect the claimant's ability to receive up to the maximum weeks of sickness benefits, if they meet all other entitlement conditions to receive sickness.A minor attached claimant (less than 600 hours of insurable employment in their qualifying period) may be able to establish a benefit period for regular  benefits. However, if the reason they have stopped working is due to illness,  they would not be entitled to sickness benefits for as long as they are  incapable of working for that reason (EIA 21(1); CUB 76344).A minor attached claimant who is not able to collect sickness benefits, but who is capable of working less than 5 days a week, may be entitled to regular  benefits.  The claimant would, however, be  subject to a disentitlement for each working day they are incapable of working.A distinction must be made between a worker with a permanent disability and one who has had to leave work as a result of a recent disability. Where a person  has worked in insurable employment while suffering from a permanent partial  disability, the person would be insured against the risk of unemployment in  that context.At no point during the benefit period should such a disability be considered in assessing prospects of employment. Claimants in this situation are only  required to be available within the full extent of their capability. Their  reduced physical or other condition will be considered in assessing what  constitutes reasonable efforts on their part to find work. Restrictions imposed  on their availability, which do not arise out of their disability, may lead to  disentitlement.",46.77811849042051,14.718287900218597,15.00032121695229,18.22936865115083,17.029002185932875,11.23179632248939,61.27356307059277,9.363636363636363,3.179974666739987,0.8541608408996637,0.4619231785620425,0.0447987019865173,0.884553591410319,0.871452134847641,4.753889674681754,4.0,2.928950457542153,32.13636363636363,27.0,16.38262786819528,1.5063649222065063,1.0,0.861498774463317,707,232,0.3281471004243281,3398,22,10.10.3,Application,Chapter 10 - Availability
694,694,"Pregnancy  and childbirth do not by themselves disentitle a claimant from benefits. The following does not apply where a claim is established for maternity rather than  regular benefits.In regard to claimants who are pregnant, the most common situations fall into 3 scenarios: voluntary unemployment as a result of the pregnancy;  pregnancies with complications; and pregnancies with no complications.  Naturally, a claimant does not demonstrate that she is available for work if  she states that she is unable to work or if she is actually unable to work  because of the pregnancy.Leaving employment voluntarily because of pregnancy strongly suggests that a claimant is unavailable, because her departure indicates that either her ability to work  is reduced, or she simply prefers not to work. The same is true of a claimant  who asks for a leave of absence rather than continuing to work, or neglects to  avail herself of an opportunity of suitable employment, during pregnancy. The  onus is on the claimant to disprove this presumption by showing that her  decision to leave her job or to refuse other work does not affect her ability  or willingness to work, and that she is still actively seeking work that she  could reasonably hope to obtain.In cases of pregnancies with complications, the first question to determine is  whether the claimant is incapable of work within the meaning of that word, as  found in the legislation, and whether she is entitled to sickness benefits. If  not entitled, an assessment must be made of the extent to which her condition  reduces prospects of employment.Unless there are reasonable employment opportunities within her reduced capability and she demonstrates her willingness to work, the claimant will not likely be able  to prove that she is capable of and available for work.While there may be no complications, a claimant may suffer from temporary illnesses at the outset of a pregnancy, which could, for short periods, prevent her from  performing her usual duties. Reasonable alternatives to quitting employment in  such cases, would be to request modified duties or a leave of absence until she  is able to return to work. Voluntarily leaving employment without first  considering these alternatives could impact the claimant's entitlement to  regular benefits, should she request them.Claimants who lose their jobs while pregnant, but do not do so voluntarily, will be considered available for work, provided they can demonstrate that they are willing  to work, at least on a temporary basis until their expected due date. Pregnancy  alone, is not considered an obstacle to a claimant's availability or capability  of obtaining employment.Where a claimant requests regular benefits following maternity and/or parental benefits, the reason she is not returning to her previous employment must be  reviewed. Failure to make the required effort to return to her usual job, or to  make the necessary child care arrangements so that she can actively seek work, is  evidence that the claimant may not be willing or available to return to the  labour force (CUB 47727). In situations where the claimant has attempted to make  child care arrangements but has been unable to do so due to the unusual hours of  employment offered, she may be considered available, provided she has made  adequate arrangements for normal working hours.",48.76199758454108,14.39389855072464,15.021129683784007,18.20386473429952,17.371387439613528,11.773495652173914,61.50966183574879,9.444444444444445,3.241310945042532,0.6675428103644799,0.4645781320237124,0.0649624421696744,0.8838301090633168,0.8917187824845314,4.846956521739131,4.0,3.0350222902735773,31.944444444444443,33.0,10.78822517697586,1.4852173913043478,1.0,0.8103937291337351,575,217,0.3773913043478261,2809,18,10.10.4,Pregnancy and childbirth,Chapter 10 - Availability

This presumption is not limited to  claimants  who are taking courses on their own initiative, but applies to all  claimants whose file  raises doubts as to their availability  for work and sincere efforts to find employment (CUB 77999, CUB 79303).Although  taking a training course is a commendable activity in and of itself,  jurisprudence clearly states that students must still demonstrate  their availability for work for the duration of their studies, and that they  must produce convincing evidence to rebut the presumption of non-availability.  This can be done by showing that their intention is to immediately accept  suitable employment, as evidenced by job search efforts, that they are prepared  to make whatever arrangements may be required, or that they are prepared to  abandon the course to accept suitable employment (CUB 73932, CUB 74693).",24.306315789473715,24.02947368421053,18.7741,28.063157894736847,30.39276315789474,12.797017543859653,85.94736842105263,16.5,3.486145261015205,0.6613265113109388,0.4523579960901658,0.0153221087098794,0.9265196522076924,0.9011169672012328,4.951754385964913,4.0,3.347209690414326,57.0,50.5,22.54994456755936,1.4736842105263157,1.0,0.8502891800738691,228,106,0.4649122807017544,1123,4,10.12.2.5,Presumption of non-availability,Chapter 10 - Availability

In reviewing the file, the  agent  should consider all circumstances and facts, such as the claimant's intentions  if a suitable job comes up, the efforts made to find employment, whether the  course is being taken for credit or simply out of interest, the claimant's  willingness to abandon the course in favour of employment, the number of hours  per week and the length of the course, the flexibility of the course schedule  to enable the claimant to accept work, the sums invested, whether a portion of  the course fees may be refunded, and the conditions of entitlement to a student  bursary or student loan, in addition to the pattern of employment and studies (FCA  A-556-04, CUB  61560A, CUB 76708).The assessment of all the subjective and objective circumstances and facts and the conditions placed on accepting employment  will  enable the  agent to  determine the effect the training course has on the claimant's availability.

718,718,"The agent should obtain specific details on the nature of the employment the claimant is  prepared to accept and the conditions under which this work will be accepted.  The  agent must  then determine if the skills and/or experience of the claimant will allow for  reasonable prospects of employment within these conditions.What must then be determined is whether the terms and conditions of the claimant's  availability are restrictive within the area's labour market. It is therefore  necessary to obtain and evaluate the labour market information to determine if  attendance at the course is detracting from the claimant's chances of obtaining  employment (CUB  53156, CUB 66265).For example, the claimant resides in an area in which there is little or no  possibility of employment and has experienced many weeks of unsuccessful job  search and difficulty finding employment because of the variable conditions of  the labour market. Faced with poor labour market conditions, a claimant  (including seasonal employment workers and those living in remote regions),  while remaining available and  searching for  work, may  decide to take a course rather than remain inactive.When making a decision in such cases, the  agent  must take into account factors related to the labour market in terms of whether        employment opportunities   are limited; or whether  local labour market conditions  are good and the claimant should be able to  become re-employed.The agent  has a  degree of flexibility when  assessing the claimant's availability in light of the local labour market.  However, in order to conclude  that a claimant's   availability in these cases is proven,  the course  should  be of secondary importance and  should  not  be an  obstacle to seeking and accepting suitable employment in the event  the labour market improves.

719,719,"Otherwise  suitable employment does not become unsuitable simply because  the hours of work would conflict with a claimant's  attendance  at a course of instruction  (Digest 9.3.1.2). Like all  other claimants  claiming regular benefits, and notwithstanding any pattern of work  in the qualifying period including any time where the claimant may have worked  and attended school at the same time, claimants attending a course of  instruction must be willing to seek and accept all hours of work that are  available  in the labour market.  This may  include   evenings, nights, shift work, potentially inconvenient or long hours, and  overtime. A claimant who is unwilling or unable to leave his course in order to  accept these hours of work, or whose job search efforts demonstrate  an  unwillingness or inability to search for and accept any hours,  may not be able to prove their availability for work, and therefore may be  subject to a disentitlement from benefits.What must be examined are the claimant's individual circumstances.

721,721,"Claimants  are required to prove that they are: available for work and unable to obtain suitable employment (EIA 18(1)(a))applying for and accepting suitable employment that they become aware of and that is vacant or  becoming vacant (EIA 27(1)(a))taking advantage of any opportunity for suitable employment (EIA 27(1)(b)), andbe able to prove that they are making reasonable and customary efforts to obtain suitable employment (EIA 50(8))All of these requirements are linked to the definition of suitable employment (EIA  6(4); EIR 9.002(1)). Claimants have always  been required to make efforts to obtain suitable employment; however, they are  not required to seek employment that is not suitable. Whether a particular  claimant is making reasonable and customary efforts to obtain suitable  employment, is an individual consideration that must take into account a number  of factors, including whether or not there are actual or potential vacancies  and opportunities in the labour market that are suitable for the claimant. If  there is a question as to whether or not there are suitable vacancies or  opportunities for a particular claimant, labour market information must be  obtained to clarify the issue.The legislation includes specific criteria that are to be used in determining  whether an employment opportunity is suitable for a particular claimant.The  legislation also lists specific criteria for determining whether the efforts  the claimant is making to obtain suitable employment constitute reasonable and  customary efforts. Those criteria include whether the claimant's efforts are:sustaineddirected toward obtaining suitable  employmentconsistent with suggested activities  that can be used to assist claimants in their efforts to obtain suitable  employment (EIR  9.001)The  claimant's efforts must be sustained (EIR 9.001(a)). They must be  continuous and extend for the duration of time that the claimant is claiming  regular benefits, although there may be situations where claimants are not able  to sustain their efforts daily. In these cases, fact finding must be done to  determine the claimant's entitlement to benefits for these days. Each case will  be considered based on all of the claimant's personal circumstances, including  the reasons their efforts were interrupted.The  claimant's efforts must be directed towards obtaining suitable employment (EIR 9.001(c)). Although claimants  may choose to seek more favourable types of employment and wages, they must be  willing to accept suitable employment as described in the legislation.What  must also be examined are the activities the claimant's efforts consist of,  which may include 1 or more of the following, or any other job search  activities (EIR 9.001(b)):assessing employment opportunitiespreparing a resume or cover letterregistering for job search tools or with electronic job banks or       employment agenciesattending job search workshops or job fairsnetworkingcontacting prospective employerssubmitting job applicationsattending interviewsundergoing evaluations of competenciesThe  extent to which claimants will use the various job search activities will vary  from claimant to claimant. Usually claimants themselves will know which job  search activities are appropriate for them, although some claimants may need  assistance in determining which activities would be helpful for them. What is  important is the effectiveness of the job search activities chosen by the  claimant. Will they really assist the claimant in becoming re-employed in  suitable employment?Depending  on the nature of the employment sought, expending efforts on only certain job  search activities may not enhance the claimant's chances of re-entry into  suitable employment. Nor will it assist certain employers who are seeking  qualified workers, if claimants do not initiate contact with them. For example,  preparing rÃ©sumÃ©s and attending job search workshops may assist claimants in  the initial stages of a job search, but it would not necessarily result in  immediate re-employment for the claimant, nor would it assist employers in  identifying potential qualified workers. Generally, such actions must be  followed by efforts to contact employers, submit job applications and attend  job interviews, if the claimant is to actually obtain employment.When  the evidence shows that there is suitable employment that is vacant or about to  become vacant, or that there are opportunities for suitable employment, the  claimant should be conducting an active search for such employment, in order to  prove that reasonable and customary efforts are being made to obtain suitable  employment (EIA 27(1)(a) and (b)). An employment  vacancy means an actual unoccupied position, while an opportunity is defined as  a situation where there is a good chance of becoming re-employed.Although  the legislation describes the types of job search efforts that are expected of  claimants, there are no legislative provisions which govern the number of job  search efforts that must be made. What is required is evidence that the  claimant sincerely wishes to put an end to the period of unemployment as  quickly as possible, and that the labour market situation is unfavourable,  despite one's willingness to work, ability and skills. The best evidence that  can be provided to this end  is a  detailed account of one's personal efforts to obtain suitable employment. As  such, claimants are required to keep a detailed account of their job search  efforts, as the Commission may, at any time, request proof of those efforts (EIA 50(8)). Availability must be examined  objectively in light of a claimant's intentions, as shown by their efforts and  in light of the existence of suitable employment. If there is doubt as to whether  or not there are suitable employment opportunities for a particular claimant,  then labour market information must be obtained to clarify the matter.Due  to seasonal and geographical circumstances, certain claimants may be faced with  reduced possibilities of obtaining employment in the short term. However,  claimants should not assume that there are absolutely no employment  opportunities for them and decide to make no efforts to find work. Rather, in  order to return to the work force as soon as possible, and to establish  on-going entitlement to benefits, claimants must continue to make efforts to  obtain employment. Besides the job search activities mentioned above, claimants  may also want to talk with former colleagues, friends and resource centres  about potential opportunities; look for potential opportunities in newspapers  and on-line; apply for any suitable employment opportunities, should they  arise; and take any other reasonable steps that may assist them in returning to  work (CUB 73820, CUB 74338, CUB 75655).Where  a claimant has been made aware of their obligations regarding job search  efforts, and disregards the requirement to make reasonable and customary  efforts to obtain suitable employment, a disentitlement from benefits will  likely result. Such was the case where: no efforts were  made to find employment (CUB 74338, CUB 68263)a claimant  completed only one job contact in 11 weeks (CUB 73580)seasonal workers  who took no steps to find employment while laid off (CUB 65588, CUB 78185)a claimant who  did nothing to find work for a year and took a break instead (FCA A-940-96, CUB 35648)a school board  employee who was not seeking temporary work in the summer months (FCA A-652-93)However,  in line with the Commission's policy to warn claimants about potential  availability restrictions (Digest 10.4.2), in cases where there has not  been an intentional disregard for the requirement to make reasonable and  customary efforts to obtain suitable employment, the Commission will remind the  claimant of the job search requirements the claimant is expected to conduct  from that point forward. It is only when claimants continue to ignore these  requirements by unreasonably restricting their job search efforts, and after  they have been given the opportunity to explain why they have continued to  ignore those requirements, that the Commission should consider a disentitlement  from benefits.Even  if it is considered that previous job search efforts have been inadequate, a  retroactive disentitlement will be applied only when other circumstances,  besides the inadequate job search itself, indicate that the claimant was  clearly not available for work during the prior period, and/or where there is  evidence of either a false or misleading statement by the claimant, or where  the claimant ought to have known they were not entitled to benefits. Such was  the case where: a claimant had  been self-employed while claiming benefits and had conducted only a minimal job  search during the same period (CUB 72138, CUB 74362)where the  claimant was restricting her availability to a business she co-owned and had  made no efforts to obtain work elsewhere (CUB 63697)where there was  no evidence that the claimant had been actively searching for employment while  attending a course of instruction (CUB 79837, CUB 80617)where a claimant  admitted that she had retired, had no intention of finding other employment and had made no efforts to find work (CUB 65852)",32.468529411764706,19.590466853408035,17.96339512986714,23.655648926237163,24.288064425770308,13.31103267973856,74.95611577964519,13.657142857142857,3.4876503826019407,0.8941545618346537,0.4513190542596642,0.0437450036616611,0.8655361690941978,0.8649100859959921,5.066013071895425,4.0,3.3085680688926127,43.71428571428572,31.0,29.741333843247688,1.5366013071895426,1.0,0.9332108907070464,1530,438,0.2862745098039215,7804,35,10.13.0,Reasonable and customary efforts to obtain suitable employment,Chapter 10 - Availability
722,722,"Rather than being inactive while waiting to hear about job applications, claimants  sometimes become involved in other activities which take up time  during the day.The time devoted to such work, intentions for the near future, the need for and urgency of the activities, and  the efforts made to find work, are some of the main factors to consider in  determining whether a claimant continues to  prove   they are available for work while engaged in such activities.As a  general rule, a strong presumption of non-availability arises when a claimant spends several hours a day on activities not geared to becoming  re-employed.  To rebut this presumption, claimants in this situation  must  be able  to show that their primary  concern is finding employment,  by providing proof of their  efforts to find work.",52.09756756756758,15.184594594594596,14.554592549557764,19.124324324324323,18.36047297297297,9.979189189189189,62.67567567567568,9.5,3.194158468778604,0.5077151599290828,0.4957520034582516,0.0327489199700809,0.8545946876207987,0.8870784044265747,4.52027027027027,4.0,2.8343205358475165,37.0,32.5,11.335784048754634,1.385135135135135,1.0,0.7308237544831678,148,90,0.6081081081081081,667,4,10.14.0,Personal business,Chapter 10 - Availability
723,723,"Volunteer  work is commonplace in our society and as long as the hours involved are minimal, and there is no actual or eventual remuneration in exchange for the  volunteer work, this is generally not an activity that would cast doubt on a  claimant's availability for work. However, a presumption of non-availability  would arise if  a claimant is  spending a significant number of hours completing volunteer work, especially if  little or no time is left to seek employment. In these situations, it would be  up to the individual to provide adequate evidence to rebut such a presumption (CUB 57703A, CUB 77869). In addition, should  the claimant be paid  for the services rendered, either at the time the volunteer work is performed or at a later date, this could cast doubt on their availability, as well as on their  unemployed status (Digest 4.5.0 , Digest 4.6.9).It  is also possible for a person to be taken on by an employer on an internship or trial basis, and receive no  payment for  the work performed during this period. EI benefits are not intended to provide compensation for the wages not paid in this type of arrangement. In order to prove availability for work, such a claimant must be willing to continue to seek and accept suitable employment elsewhere, and must continue to  make reasonable and customary efforts to obtain such employment (CUB 74221, CUB 80699. In addition to a  claimant's availability, the question as to whether or not the claimant is  actually unemployed, must also be examined in these types of cases (Digest 4.5.2).",44.50393501805056,16.882568334192886,16.785175570968402,21.604744713769986,19.848277462609595,10.283465703971116,64.84218669417226,10.0,3.378271002669181,0.7090927638841787,0.4620349541992866,0.0492523906781434,0.8866031070550283,0.872883939743042,4.563176895306859,4.0,2.943600048083347,39.57142857142857,36.0,18.661320906066205,1.444043321299639,1.0,0.8290368285578237,277,128,0.4620938628158845,1282,7,10.14.1,Volunteer work,Chapter 10 - Availability
724,724,"A  presumption of non-availability arises when the work undertaken to build or  repair premises with the intention of establishing a profitable  business has an element of necessity,  urgency or importance. This presumption is much stronger when the evidence  indicates that the claimant is spending a greater number of hours doing the  work than seeking employment (CUB 65452, CUB  76152).In cases where a presumption exists, the onus is on claimants to rebut it by  showing that their primary concern is finding employment. In addition to  conducting a reasonable job search, they must show that they would not hesitate to reduce or abandon their activities if an opportunity for suitable employment arises. Non-availability is evident in cases where claimants who have voluntarily left their employment specifically to devote more time to their own personal activities, or have refused an employment opportunity for this reason.For claimants who are engaged in building or repairing their business or other  premises, it is not sufficient to show that they are available for work. They must also prove that they are unemployed while being engaged in these  activities (Digest  4.6.6)",46.01272727272729,15.03959595959596,16.32212239822248,19.664646464646463,18.57242424242424,12.643636363636356,63.30303030303031,10.0,3.131672895710931,0.6101306579805007,0.4408129856917115,0.0635945373491469,0.8952429175376893,0.8629026710987091,4.98989898989899,4.0,3.035130834365489,33.0,31.5,11.239810200058244,1.505050505050505,1.0,0.8333180286320339,198,107,0.5404040404040404,992,6,10.14.2,Building and repairs,Chapter 10 - Availability
725,725,"In  the case of claimants who are engaged in preliminary work required before going  into business, or those who are about to start operating a business, the first  question to determine is whether they are in fact unemployed (Digest 4.6.2 , Digest 4.6.6 ), while engaged in these  activities. Being unemployed is not all that is required to remain entitled to  benefits; availability for work other than for their business, must also be  proven. When looking at both questions of whether the claimant is unemployed  and available for other work while trying to set up a profitable  business,  some of the factors to consider apply to both issues at the same time,  especially with regards to the claimant's intentions and the amount of time  devoted to the project. Often the 2 issues can be regarded  together and a decision made as to  whether the claimant has proven to be unemployed and available.A  claimant's intentions are clear when the facts show a preoccupation with  business preparations and they are not making    any reasonable  and customary efforts to find work, as  required by the legislation. The presumption of non-availability will be even  stronger if the evidence indicates that the claimant devotes  a  significant number of hours to the project, or if this was the  reason for voluntarily leaving or refusing work (CUB 72138, CUB 77869).Even  though their availability may be  accepted,  this does not mean that they are unemployed. Even workers who have full-time  employment may at times make considerable efforts to find a better job,  however, this does not amount to being unemployed. The rules to be applied in  determining when a claimant is unemployed are discussed in  chapter 4 of this Digest.In  cases where claimants are disentitled from benefits for failing to prove they  are unemployed, the disentitlement will cover full calendar weeks, since  according to the legislation the question to determine is whether or not each  week  under consideration is a week of  unemployment (EIA 11). As for partial weeks,  the legislation provides for a deduction to be made from the benefits payable  for that week, in proportion to the income arising out of the business for that  week (EIR 35(2), EIR 36(6)). It is often  difficult to assess the income arising out of a business in the first few days  of operation. For this reason, the practice is to consider the claimant as not  available for those days, so that the deduction to be made becomes easily  calculable. This is because, even though they may have received little to no  actual earnings, the fact that their efforts are mainly concentrated on making  their business viable and not on obtaining other suitable employment, amounts  to non-availability for the purposes of the EIA.",45.96876093965916,16.42163672654691,15.091289759661642,19.966282818977437,19.16114693689544,10.05037924151696,63.68816213726393,9.692307692307692,3.672541427835678,1.0349776441649496,0.4675307828381818,0.0507038361849879,0.898378719886144,0.8990560390732505,4.526946107784431,4.0,2.903946735359691,38.53846153846154,37.0,13.703539041011291,1.439121756487026,1.0,0.8133040637703821,501,199,0.3972055888223553,2274,13,10.14.3,Starting a business,Chapter 10 - Availability
726,726,"It  is not uncommon for an employed person to  assist  in running a family business after working hours, and it seems reasonable that  the assistance given would  increase  during a  period of unemployment. This situation is most frequent in cases where a claimant's  family member   operates a business.The  first question to determine is whether a claimant's assistance can be compared  to the services an employee of the business would provide under the  circumstances. Depending on the answer, claimants in this situation may be  required to show not only that they are available for work, but also that they  are unemployed (CUB 74837B). The latter issue is  dealt with in chapter 4 of this Digest.With  respect to availability, claimants, as recipients of EI benefits from the  public fund, are required to show that their primary concern is to find  employment. They must be able to provide evidence  of personal efforts to find work,  when requested by the Commission. A strong presumption of  non-availability arises in cases of claimants who devote most of their time to helping  with  a business  rather than looking for employment (CUB 66217).",61.41768867924529,11.2761320754717,12.38480682065935,14.562264150943395,12.859481132075471,9.3488679245283,51.97169811320755,6.75,3.194096676163739,0.7184555206526899,0.4877800491658726,0.0626388127538528,0.821484455040523,0.8059828182061514,4.466981132075472,4.0,2.881928786064272,26.5,29.0,8.455767262643882,1.400943396226415,1.0,0.7167793906839262,212,113,0.5330188679245284,946,8,10.14.4,Family business,Chapter 10 - Availability
727,727,"On occasion  a claimant is called upon to perform jury duty, a service which is extremely  important in our judicial system. The intent of the legislation is to allow  those individuals to perform their civic duties and continue to receive  employment insurance benefits (EIA 18(1)(c)): A claimant is not entitled to be paid benefits for any working day in a benefit period for which the claimant fails to prove that on  that day the claimant was . . .(c) engaged in jury service.Engagement  in jury service includes not only individuals who have been sworn in as members  of a jury  for a  specific trial, but also those  who have received a  general duty call in which they form a group of potential jurors who may later  be selected to hear specific trials. Jury service also applies to a coroner's inquest.A  declaration of non-availability by a claimant for being  engaged in jury service will not result in a disentitlement. A disentitlement  related to capability or availability that is in effect when the claimant is  engaged in jury service will be suspended for that period. However, these  claimants must still fulfill all other qualifying and  entitlement conditions. Receiving a subpoena to appear as  a witness at a criminal trial cannot be equated to jury duty (CUB 69306).The  conditions imposed by a court order will often prevent  a claimant  from establishing their availability for work. Such was the case where a court  order was imposed on a claimant to undergo closed treatment in an establishment  similar to a prison (CUB 59851), where a suspended  sentence of imprisonment gave rise to a court order requiring that the claimant  stay at home (CUB 61368), and where following a  serious criminal charge, a court ordered that a claimant be hospitalized so  that his criminal responsibility could be evaluated (CUB 69572). In addition, a  claimant who takes a leave of absence from employment to care for a child who  is in the claimant's custody pursuant to a court order would not be able to  establish that they are available for work (CUB 70563). Likewise, a claimant  who leaves employment in order to comply with a court order that they reside  with the parent of a child while the parent is caring for the child, would also  be unable to establish their availability for work (CUB 78077).",51.23113122171949,14.235294117647058,14.772240535888995,18.159276018099547,15.839636199095018,9.415623529411764,57.633484162895925,8.153846153846153,3.05087276537194,0.8748656214444563,0.4707433479127878,0.0599571282730923,0.8064797321955363,0.8117884289134633,4.442352941176471,4.0,2.9002383865747894,32.69230769230769,27.0,19.749915736469184,1.4470588235294115,1.0,0.8444403974082993,425,180,0.4235294117647059,1897,13,10.14.5,Jury duty and court orders,Chapter 10 - Availability

732,732,"Having met the required qualifying conditions to have a benefit period established does not necessarily authorize the payment of sickness benefits. The following extract of Section 18 (1) (b) identifies two conditions a claimant must meet to be entitled to receive sickness benefits.A claimant is not entitled to be paid benefits for a working day in a benefit period for which the claimant fails to prove that on that day the claimant wasunable to work because of prescribed illness, injury or quarantine, andthat the claimant would otherwise be available for work.The expression to be unable to work refers specifically to the fact that a person is, by reason of illness, injury or quarantine, incapable of performing the functions of his or her regular or usual employment or of other suitable employment   .There may be  situations in which it will be necessary to decide whether a person is in fact unable to work within the meaning of the Act and the Regulations. The situation of each individual in this respect is unique. In other words, it will be necessary to determine to what extent the illness, injury or quarantine has reduced the person's prospects of finding work in either his or her regular or usual occupation or other activities suited to his or her training, aptitudes and abilities or work history   .For example, the fact that a person is incapable of performing all the duties required in his or her usual employment, such as lifting heavy objects, or that the person is only capable of performing simple tasks due to his or her state of health, does not necessarily prevent this person from holding other employment that would be compatible with this restricted capability.Along the same lines, the fact that a person's capabilities decline with age or are reduced by reason of illness or injury does not necessarily mean that this person is irreparably incapable of work. There could very well be other employment suited to the person's condition.Generally, when claimants become incapacitated while employed, the question of whether they are capable of other suitable employment is not an issue, unless there is a chance for claimants to obtain other employment within the short period of their incapacity without jeopardizing their regular employment.Then the agent must determine what types of employment would be suitable for that particular claimant and, as well, the actual prospects of obtaining such employment.If the agent determines that, even though the claimant proves limited capability, the possibilities of obtaining employment which would be appropriate to training, skills and abilities or past experience are practically non-existent or make it unrealistic to expect the claimant to undertake such employment, the officer will nevertheless consider the claimant physically unable to work for the purposes of sickness benefits, even if the medical evidence does not support total incapacity.",35.15457184325112,17.471362683438155,17.30067935935376,21.38551846476375,20.84137397194001,13.261719077568134,67.50991775520077,11.307692307692308,3.309663680374527,1.0134316777642858,0.4725534233165028,0.0407247372197018,0.8735605031251907,0.8975354703989896,5.079664570230608,4.0,2.881653360995664,36.69230769230769,34.0,18.24358523884118,1.5890985324947589,1.0,0.8895660171604665,477,201,0.4213836477987421,2463,13,11.2.0,First entitlement condition: to be unable to work,Chapter 11 - Sickness benefits
733,733,"There must be a cause-and-effect relationship between the illness, injury or quarantine and the fact that a claimant is incapable of work . It should also be understood that only an illness, injury or quarantine affecting the person who is making a claim for benefits is relevant here.Pregnancy and childbirth are not, strictly speaking, an illness. This, however, does not necessarily mean that a woman who is pregnant or who has just given birth to a child cannot, in some circumstances, make a claim and receive benefits under the sickness benefits provisions .A physical or mental disability is not necessarily the equivalent of an inability to work   . Certain persons may prove that they are capable of work within the limits of their capacities, either because their handicap is not an obstacle to employment,  because they were able to adjust to it on the basis of the labour market, or because they have the opportunity to work in a protected work environment.Drug and alcohol dependency is without question another factor likely to render a person incapable of work during certain acute phases. It is possible that such a person will be treated in an outpatient clinic or will instead be admitted to a clinic, hospital or specialized centre for addiction treatment. Such a stay constitutes tangible proof that the person is not able to work, in which case the payment of sickness benefits will be considered, unless the admission is a condition of mandatory confinement which is occasionally imposed by courts of law in their sentences. Such mandatory confinement may be regarded as a stay in an institution similar to a prison .",48.91805595667873,13.317693140794226,15.112257680678326,17.43379061371841,15.23884476534296,11.61862815884476,55.858844765342965,7.8,3.241971760980461,0.8863353699800911,0.4555093745281248,0.0698265996605192,0.8961163560549418,0.9031179025769234,4.844765342960288,4.0,2.860363329113797,27.7,24.5,13.660527076214883,1.5342960288808665,1.0,0.8431593237454517,277,147,0.5306859205776173,1364,10,11.2.1,By reason of illness injury or quarantine,Chapter 11 - Sickness benefits
734,734,"In order to prove that on any given day for which sickness benefits are requested,  a person was unable to work because of a prescribed illness, injury or quarantine, this person must obtain, at their own expense, a medical certificate that attests to the incapacity, the start date, the probable duration of the incapacity and signed by a doctor or other medical practitioner.A medical certificate is acceptable when signed by:a medical doctor (Canadian or American)a registered nurse, only in isolated areas, when a doctor is not availableA medical certificate is also acceptable when  signed by one of the following health professionals if the illness being  treated is within their field of expertise:a psychologist; a chiropractor;an optometrist;a dentist;a nurse practitioner;a midwife;a podiatrist.A medical certificate completed and signed by a massage therapist, osteopath, naturopath, physiotherapist, an acupuncturist (with some exceptions   ), Christian Science Adherence Practitioner or a foreign doctor (other than American) is not acceptable.The Commission is  authorized to make regulations prescribing the information to be submitted by a  person to prove their inability to work   . On this subject, the  Regulations say that the information and evidence to be provided to the  Commission by a claimant in order to prove inability to work because of  illness, injury or quarantine pursuant to paragraph 18(b) of the Act, is a  medical certificate completed by a medical doctor or other medical professional  attesting to the claimant's inability to work and stating the probable duration  of the illness, injury or quarantine.The individual is not always required to submit the medical certificate to the Commission, in order to receive sickness benefits. When applying for sickness benefits, the person is advised to obtain a medical certificate from their doctor and either submit it immediately, or keep it in a safe place as it may be required at a later date.In some instances, the individual's statement of being unable to work because of illness may not be sufficient. The same can be said that providing a medical certificate does not necessarily prove a person's inability to work. It is possible that the information in the medical certificate is not along the same lines as the individual's statements.The Commission may also consider that there is no inability to work or that the proof provided will only cover part of the alleged period of inability to work. The Commission has various means and resources to obtain adequate proof of inability to work in order to make a decision on varied or inconsistent information on file.",26.85163978494623,18.49887096774194,18.68694054745388,22.66943164362519,20.45294162826421,13.093179723502304,68.19431643625191,11.583333333333334,3.4885426065687963,0.7903319236257113,0.449909020924947,0.0627866387502004,0.8807976625182412,0.8722604393959046,5.052995391705069,4.0,3.210646569819252,36.16666666666666,28.5,19.5056971734471,1.6935483870967742,1.0,1.00716549773341,434,167,0.3847926267281106,2229,12,11.2.2,The medical certificate a significant source of information,Chapter 11 - Sickness benefits
735,735,"The agent who makes the decision on the claimant's entitlement to sickness benefits must be in a position to gather and judge a multitude of sometimes contradictory information and medical declarations concerning the state of a person's health. It is therefore essential for the agent to have the means and resources to facilitate the determination of the validity of the statements.The attending physician, especially a specialist in the field, is generally the best judge of a person's state of health. The physician's role in respect of benefits comes down to providing or certifying any information considered appropriate concerning the nature of the illness, injury or quarantine, the probable duration of the inability to work and any other circumstances related thereto.The attending physician does not decide on the entitlement to sickness benefits. That responsibility rather, belongs to the Commission, which must rule on the various conditions to entitlement, provided for in the Act.When determining entitlement to sickness benefits, clarification or additional information concerning a person's state of health may be required. As well, a variety of situations may arise where an independent medical examination will be considered necessary to counterbalance certain information already entered in the file, to dispel certain doubts as to a person's state of health or to help clarify cases of inability that are complex, ambiguous or contradictory. In these cases, the Commission has full authority to require an independent medical examination if it considers it appropriate to do so. This is a formal obligation for the claimant, and a failure to comply with this direction may be grounds for denying benefits   .If the Commission does consider that an independent medical examination is required, the choice of the independent medical examiner rests with the Commission. However, considering the intimate nature of such examinations and the need for a relationship of trust between the claimant and the physician, the Commission will provide the choice of another medical examiner where the claimant objects to the first selection, unless the reasons invoked are frivolous or trifling.It is reasonable to conclude that not all these means and resources will be used in every case. It will depend on the quality of the information gathered in relation to the first entitlement condition to fulfill.",35.35000000000002,15.000775075987844,17.122413403193683,19.679027355623106,17.076816109422495,14.405744680851065,63.02735562310031,9.714285714285714,2.934997567686913,0.5561943976463317,0.4954936922298926,0.0583155008115227,0.8953237120921795,0.8820417573054632,5.324468085106383,4.0,3.2058850860802317,26.857142857142858,22.0,11.506874608915584,1.7047872340425532,1.0,1.0771210927039117,376,170,0.4521276595744681,2042,14,11.2.3,Other means and sources of information,Chapter 11 - Sickness benefits
736,736,"In addition to the requirement of having to demonstrate that the individual is incapable of work by reason of a prescribed illness, injury or quarantine, that individual would also have to demonstrate that he would have been available for work, if it were not for the illness, injury or quarantine.The only exception to this section of the Act is for claimants who are in receipt of QuÃ©bec Parental Insurance Plan (QPIP) parental benefits or EI parental, compassionate care or family caregiver benefits. Section 18 (2) of the Act stipulates that:2. A claimant to whom benefits are payable under any of sections 23 to 23.2 is not disentitled under paragraph (1)(b) for failing to prove that he or she would have been available for work were it not for the illness, injury or quarantine.Claimants in receipt of EI parental, compassionate care or family caregiver benefits who wish to convert to sickness benefits, and who provide proof of incapacity, are exempt from showing they would otherwise be available for work.An individual who makes a claim for sickness benefits is not only required to demonstrate being unable to work because of a prescribed illness, injury or quarantine, but also to demonstrate that he would be otherwise available for work. The purpose of this second entitlement condition  is to pay sickness benefits only to individuals who would be otherwise available, if they had not been unable to work because of the prescribed illness, the injury or the quarantine.Whether the individual would be otherwise available for work if it had not been for the prescribed illness, the injury or the  quarantine will be determined in the same way as if the individual was able to work. The reason for separation, the individual's personal situation, his intentions if he had not been incapable of working, and other requirements and restrictions in relation to the labour market, are all factors that reflect on otherwise availability for work during the period of incapacity. The chronology of events may also be very revealing evidence in this determination. If the inability to work arises when there is already a current disentitlement on the ground of non-availability, or a situation that would be grounds for disentitlement, it may be difficult for the individual to demonstrate that he would be otherwise available for work. For example, where the inability arose after the person was not available to work for their usual employer because he was on leave of absence.It is quite possible that the situation will only arise once the period of inability to work is under way or at the same time as that period. The question then is, what would this individual have been doing, had he not been incapable of working? The situation may be one that was expected or planned, that is totally unrelated to the inability, and in respect of which the person could not in normal circumstances prove that he would have been available. An example might be a specific period of holidays or leave of absence that the claimant had scheduled prior to their inability to work, and actually took, in spite of his or her inability to work.A person may want to take advantage of a period of inability and, instead of doing nothing, signs up for a part-time short-duration training course or spends the period of convalescence at a place away from home, such as the cottage. Because such situations would not have arisen if the individual would had been able to work, it cannot be said that in such situations the individual has not proven that he was otherwise available for work for that period. On the other hand, entitlement to benefits would be considered under a separate section of the EI legislation, in the case of a stay outside Canada.The situation would be different if, for example, a claimant was to decide to take advantage of a long period of inability to work, to look after preparations for a business, increase the level of activity with the aim of eventually working on his or her own account, or expending a significant part of his or her time and energy on a job that was only secondary before the inability arose. In such a case, whether the person is actually unemployed, otherwise available for work, and unable to hold any other suitable employment will be open to question.Those who withdraw from the labour market while on sabbatical leave may also be affected by illness, injury or quarantine and make a claim for sickness benefits. Such persons cannot usually prove that they would be otherwise available for work unless that inability to work has delayed their return to the labour market. In this last case, they may show that they would be otherwise available as of the original date on which they were scheduled to return to work.Claimants in receipt of EI parental, compassionate care or family caregiver benefits who provide proof of incapacity can convert their claim to sickness benefits without having to meet the requirement to be otherwise available for work.",45.69180839160842,15.41228251748252,15.27456517841124,18.99606526806527,18.116223776223777,11.284662004662003,60.66032634032634,9.04,3.363086626703415,0.6227151973243478,0.4734423857776078,0.0595734009676919,0.8670054549972216,0.848098767840344,4.752913752913753,4.0,2.794353638315076,34.32,36.0,12.463450565553666,1.493006993006993,1.0,0.8462573864101051,858,260,0.303030303030303,4156,25,11.3.0,Second entitlement condition: to be otherwise available for work,Chapter 11 - Sickness benefits
737,737,"A minor attachment claimant, namely one who has been employed in insurable employment for fewer than 600 hours in their qualifying period   , may have a benefit period established and fulfill the two entitlement conditions to sickness benefits without necessarily being allowed to receive such benefits.The following extract of the Act    provides a specific condition for the minor attachment claimant:A minor attachment claimant who ceases work because of illness, injury or quarantine is not entitled to receive benefits while unable to work for that reason.This provision obviously does not apply if the minor attachment claimant qualifies for regular benefits when the inability occurred and the reason the claimant stopped working was not because of illness, injury or quarantine. This also means that individuals who are unemployed and already receiving EI benefits can apply and may be entitled to sickness benefits.A minor attachment claimant who, due to the inability to work, is unable to participate in an employment activity to which he or she had been referred by the authority designated by the Commission, will not be disentitled because he or she could not or no longer participate in the activity for that reason. In that case had the claimant not agreed initially to participate in such an activity, he or she would be entitled to receive sickness benefits.This provision does not affect a minor attachment claimant whose inability prevents the carrying out of activities as a self-employed person or from engaging in the operation of a business on his or her own account or in partnership or a co-adventure.

The only exception is when regular benefits and extended parental benefits were paid in the initial benefit period. Refer to Chapter 13 - Parental benefits, for more information on combining regular and extended parental benefits and the maximum number of weeks that can be paid under these circumstances.A maximum of 102 weeks of combined special benefits may be payable, and the initial benefit period extended to a maximum of 104 weeks, if, during the initial benefit period: No regular benefits have been paid during the initial benefit period; andMore than one type of special benefits was paid; and at least one of these special benefits was paid for fewer than the applicable maximum number of weeks payable for these special benefits, andThe maximum total number of weeks payable for the types of special benefits requested is greater than 50.If a specific type of special benefits was not paid during the initial benefit period, it cannot be paid during the extended benefit period.The initial benefit period ends on the earlier of:When 50 weeks of special benefits have been paid; orBenefit period start date plus 51 weeks plus any weeks of extension due to work-sharing or for one of the following reasons Confined in a jail, penitentiary or other similar institution and was not found guilty of the offence for which the claimant was being held or any other offence arising out of the same transaction;In receipt of earnings paid because of the complete severance of their relationship with their former employer;In receipt of workers' compensation payments for an illness or injury;orIn receipt of payments under a provincial law on the basis of having ceased to work because continuing to work would have resulted in danger to the claimant, her unborn child or a child whom she was breast-feeding.It is important to note that for the purpose of the extension of the benefit period, when reference is made to benefits paid for a pregnancy or caring for a child, this also refers to the provincial benefits that have been paid to the claimant for the same reasons. This means that QuÃ©bec Parental Insurance Plan benefits can be used to extend the EI benefit period to allow the claimant to receive the maximum number of special benefits weeks under the EI Act, other than maternity or parental, to which he/she is entitled.A claimant who does not qualify for regular benefits under the EI Act      , but qualifies for special benefits because of a regulatory exception can only receive special benefits.The limit to the number of weeks of special benefits payable also includes benefits paid under the QuÃ©bec Parental Insurance Plan.

Whether the inability in question already existed before the detention or occurred while the person was incarcerated is irrelevant.The exception mentioned in the above extract is covered in the following provision of the Regulations   :A claimant who is an inmate of a prison or similar institution and who has been granted parole, day parole, temporary absence or a certificate of availability, for the purpose of seeking and accepting employment in the community, is not disentitled from receiving benefits by reason only of section 37 of the Act.The question is therefore primarily one of availability in the labour market   .

Sickness benefits will not be denied for the sole reason that the temporary absence has been suspended because the inmate is temporarily unable to work.The Act refers to a claimant who is an inmate of any prison or similar institution. The test to be applied to determine whether another institution can be described as similar to a prison is whether or not the stay in such a place is for detention or punishment purposes. If that is not the case, it cannot be concluded that the institution is similar to a prison.Thus, a psychiatric institution in which a person charged with a criminal offence had been interned to evaluate his or her fitness to stand trial is not recognized as an institution similar to a prison   .

751,751,"It happens from time to time that a person who is temporarily unable to work plans to spend part of his or her convalescence in milder climates outside Canada or, conversely, that a person who is outside Canada suddenly becomes unable to work. Both are entitled to ask whether the situation in question is detrimental to claiming sickness benefits.It should be said right away that in this respect the EI Act has imposed the following rigorous provisions   :Except as may otherwise be prescribed, a claimant is not entitled to receive benefits for any period during which the claimant\u2026is not in Canada.The exception mentioned above is found primarily in the following provision of the Regulations   :\u2026 a claimant is not disentitled from receiving benefits for the reason that the claimant is outside Canada \u2026 for the purpose of undergoing, at a hospital, medical clinic or similar facility outside Canada, medical treatment that is not readily or immediately available in the claimant's area of residence in Canada, if the hospital, clinic or facility is accredited to provide the medical treatment by the appropriate governmental authority outside Canada.Thus, with the exceptions of a person whose most recent interruption of earnings is from insurable employment outside of Canada    and of a person who is absent for specified reasons and duration   , it can be said in general terms that a person must satisfy two specific conditions in addition to the two entitlement conditions to sickness benefits   .The person who is outside Canada must in fact be undergoing medical treatment in a hospital, medical clinic or similar facility located in a country other than Canada, and the treatment as such must be medical treatment that is not readily available in the claimant's area of residence in Canada.The Act leaves no room for other circumstances that could occur where a person might, for personal reasons or on the recommendation of a physician, have to stay outside the country, even with a medical certificate establishing the inability to work   .The prescription is not limited to a person whose inability to work arose before his or her stay outside Canada. It also applies to a person whose inability to work arose while he or she was outside the country. Both must show that they satisfy the two conditions specified in the Regulations.The question whether the person proves that he or she would be otherwise available for work is always relevant in such a case   .It must be understood that the person must undergo the treatment in a hospital, medical clinic or similar facility in a country other than Canada, and that it must be a medical treatment that is not readily available in the claimant's area of residence in Canada. It must not be a miracle treatment or any kind of cure that is claimed to be the panacea for all illnesses, but a treatment that, while not necessarily conventional, may be seen as being relatively effective and is recognized by a scientific or medical authority   .There are several factors that might lead someone who is unable to work to undergo medical treatment in a country other than Canada. It might be due to, amongst others: the urgency of the situation as opposed to the immediate availability of the treatment in a Canadian health institution, the proximity of the residence to the treatment centre, the supposed quality of care, or the technological advancements and expertise of certain medical science authorities or clinics renowned for the treatment of certain illnesses or for certain procedures.What is critical to determine is whether the treatment is a type that is not readily available in the claimant's area of residence in Canada. The agent will make that determination. It is not necessary that the claimant be hospitalised.A facility outside Canada that offers a treatment prescribed in Canada is considered to be an accredited facility.

754,754,"Maternity benefits are intended for birth parents during pregnancy, and for a specific period surrounding the birth of the child. The underlying principle for the payment of these benefits under the current Employment Insurance (EI) program is that birth parents should be provided with a level of protection from the loss of earnings caused by the physical inability to work or to seek work, in the weeks surrounding the birth of a child.Maternity benefits are therefore paid to the birth parent to compensate for a period of physical inability to work, associated with pregnancy and childbirth. They are distinct from parental benefits, which are paid to parents to provide actual care for a child.The QuÃ©bec Parental Insurance Plan (QPIP) applies to claims for benefits relating to a birth or adoption of a child, for parents residing in QuÃ©bec. The EI program applies to any claim relating to a birth or an adoption of a child for parents residing outside QuÃ©bec.This does not mean, however, that maternity benefits under the EI program are not payable in QuÃ©bec or that the impact of the QPIP is limited to QuÃ©bec.Among other rules, the principle of equivalence between benefits paid under the QPIP and the EI program, guarantees equity in the processing of claims for EI benefits filed throughout Canada, including QuÃ©bec. This principle recognizes that maternity or parental benefits paid under the EI program, are similar to benefits paid under a provincial plan.

766,766,"A claimant who is pregnant may request and be entitled to sickness benefits during the maternity period (EIA 22(2)). Although pregnancy and childbirth are not considered illnesses, complications with respect to either may be. To receive sickness benefits, the person must obtain, at their own expense, a medical certificate that attests to the incapacity, the start date, the probable duration of the incapacity and is signed by a medical doctor or other medical professional (Digest 11.2.2).Once qualifying conditions are met, this claim is dealt with according to the principles applicable to any person requesting sickness benefits, with one exception for minor attached claimants (Digest 11.1.0). This exception provides that claimants who do not have the required number of hours (600) to establish a claim for maternity benefits, but had sufficient hours to establish a claim for regular benefits (420-599), are not required to prove incapacity for the actual day of the child's birth and for the 14 calendar days immediately following the child's birth. The birth itself is considered adequate proof of incapacity and the claimant may be paid sickness benefits for this period. Normally this issue will only arise when the claimant is collecting regular benefits during their maternity window.In all cases, the claimant must still demonstrate that they would be otherwise available for work for each day they are requesting sickness benefits during the maternity period.It is not uncommon for a claimant to request sickness benefits for a period immediately prior to starting their maternity leave. In these cases, sickness benefits may be payable, provided the claimant can demonstrate that, were it not for their illness, they would have continued to work, or would have been available for work. The start date of maternity benefits for claimants who request sickness benefits prior to maternity, will be as follows:where there is an indication that the claimant would have continued to work until the week in which the expected date of birth falls (EDC - expected date of confinement), sickness benefits will be allowed until the week prior to EDC. Maternity benefits would begin as of the week of EDC, even if the child is born laterwhere the actual date the child is born is prior to the EDC, sickness benefits will be allowed until the week prior to the week the child was born (ADC - actual date of confinement). Maternity benefits would begin as of the ADCwhere the claimant had made arrangements with their employer to start maternity leave on a specific date, sickness benefits will be allowed until the week prior to the week in which the pre-arranged maternity leave was to begin.

778,778,"Parental benefits under the EI program are provided for the purpose of caring for one or more new-born children of the claimant or one or more children placed with the claimant for the purpose of adoption. They may be paid to any of the biological parents, legal parents or parent with whom the child is placed for the purpose of adoption, or may be shared between parents (EI Act 23(4)), to a combined maximum of 40 weeks of standard parental benefits or 69 weeks of extended parental benefits  When parental benefits are shared, both parents must receive benefits under the same option, standard or extended.  One parent cannot receive more than 35 weeks of standard parental benefits or 61 weeks of extended parental benefits.The individual claiming the parental benefits must have experienced an interruption of earnings (EI Act 7; EI Regulation 14(2)), and have 600 hours of insurable employment in the qualifying period (EI Act 23(1), EI Act 6(1)). The claimant must provide a declaration as to the newborn's date of birth, or, when the placement is for the purposes of adoption, the child's date of placement with the claimant and the name and address of the adoption authority.In situations where a violation had been assessed on a previous claim, the claimant will require more than 600 hours of insurable employment during the qualifying period to be eligible for parental benefits. Violations range from minor to subsequent (EI Act 7.1(1); Digest 18.10.6) with a related increase in the number of hours required to qualify for benefits.Placements for the purpose of an adoption made by an agency or individual authorized to make such placements under applicable provincial laws governing adoption are recognized under Section 23 of the EI Act . In addition to intra-provincial placements for adoption, the legislation in several provinces also covers interprovincial and international adoptions. Accordingly, parental benefits may be paid to the claimant with whom a child from the claimant's province, another province or another country has been placed for the purpose of adoption, provided that such placement has been made in accordance with the laws that apply in the province or territory where the claimant resides. Parental benefits are also payable to a claimant who attests that it is their intent to adopt a child placed with them by a recognized authority because circumstances exist that render the legally recognized parent(s) incapable of caring for the child (FCA A-136-12; CUB 78779).To establish whether a claimant is entitled to parental benefits under Section 23 of the Act, the following needs to be determined:Was the child placed with the claimant?Was the placement of the child for the purpose of adoption?Was it according to laws governing adoption in the province in which the claimant resides?         OrWas the child placed with the claimant by a recognized authority because circumstances exist that renders the legally recognized parent(s) incapable of caring for the child; andDoes the claimant attest that they consider the placement a permanent one and it is their intention to adopt the child?When a claimant is requesting EI parental benefits for a child that has been placed with them by a recognized authority, benefits under Section 23 of the EI Act may be payable if it is the claimant's intention to adopt the child. In cases where the child is not legally adoptable at the time the child is placed with the claimant by a recognized authority, parental benefits may be payable if the claimant attests that they consider the placement a permanent one and that it is their intent to adopt the child placed with them at the earliest opportunity. Although a verbal attestation is acceptable, the Commission may, at any time, request proof that the child was placed with them by a recognized authority and that the placement was not merely a temporary one.In any adoption situation for which parental benefits have been correctly allowed under Section 23 of the Act, should the adoption fail to proceed for any reason, or should a claimant's intention to adopt change, the claimant's entitlement to EI parental benefits would cease the earlier of: 1) the first Sunday after the child is removed from the adoptive home; or, 2) the first Sunday following the official termination of the adoption proceedings. No over payment would be created.  It is the claimant's responsibility to inform the Commission if the adoption fails to proceed or if their intent to adopt changes.Child legally adoptable or not legally adoptable In the case of a child that is legally adoptable on the placement date, the Commission can at any time request proof that the adoption process has started. Should the Commission request it, the claimant must provide a letter issued by the recognized adoption authority certifying that an official adoption file has been opened by the claimant for the purpose of adopting the child for whom they are claiming parental benefits. This letter will constitute proof that a child has been placed for the purpose of adoption and that the placement was made under the laws governing adoption in the province in which the claimant resides. In cases where the child is not legally adoptable, a verbal attestation from the claimant that they consider the placement a permanent one and that it is their intent to adopt the child placed with them at the earliest opportunity is acceptable.  In these circumstances, the Commission may, at any time, request proof from the claimant certifying that the child for whom they are claiming parental benefits as been placed with them by a recognized authority and that the placement was not merely a temporary one. The following lists some of the various placement processes, some of which entitle the claimant to benefits effective the date of placement, others on later dates and others not at all. Note: In some cases the child may not be legally adoptable on the placement date.  In these cases, the above criteria apply.  Additional information may be requested in specific cases.1. Foster to Adopt program Under a Foster to Adopt program or other similar programs, a child is placed for the purpose of adoption prior to the natural parents having consented to the adoption or having relinquished their rights to the child.Entitlement to EI is proven from the date of placement if the following criteria are met:the child was physically placed with the claimant for the purpose of adoption; andthe claimant has demonstrated a commitment to adopt the child under the laws governing adoption in the province or territory in which the claimant resides.2. Private adoption In the case of a private adoption, if the claimant can submit a letter from their attorney demonstrating that the adoption process has started or attest that it is their intent to adopt the child placed with them at the earliest opportunity, the placement will be considered to have been made for the purpose of adoption and parental benefits are payable.3. Resource foster families Resource foster families commit to adopting a child placed with them if that child is unable to return to its birth family or a kinship placement cannot be arranged. The foster family is aware that efforts are being undertaken by the adoption authority to return the child to its birth family or to find the child a kinship placement. They understand that, in some cases, the child may leave their care should these efforts be successful.Entitlement to parental benefits is proven from the date the claimant officially opens a file with the recognized adoption authority for the purposes of adopting the child or, in cases where the child is not legally adoptable, from the date the claimant attests that it is their intent to adopt the child placed with them and that they consider the placement a permanent one.4. Adoption not in the best interest of the child A placement may be accepted when, instead of an adoption, the claimant has been granted permanent, legal custody because it is in the best interest of the child not to proceed with an adoption. In other words, such a situation may be effectively, but not technically an adoption. Fact finding must be conducted in these cases in order to determine that the placement is permanent. For example, a Court could choose to issue a Permanent Custody Order rather than an Adoption order because an Adoption Order could be to the detriment of the child.  The Court could deem that a Permanent Custody Order is effectively an adoption situation since it would give the claimant an identical role, responsibility and permanency that an Adoption Order would have bestowed. Such cases of permanent custody would be treated as adoptions and benefits would be payable to the claimant. 5. Foster care A child placed for the purpose of foster care is not the same as being placed for the purpose of adoption. If a child is placed with a claimant for the purpose of foster care, and the foster parent (claimant) later pursues adopting that child, parental benefits are only payable once the adoption process has commenced. The opening of an official file with a recognized adoption authority for the purpose of adopting that child will be considered as the start of the adoption process and parental benefits will become payable effective on that date, or, in cases where the child is not legally adoptable, from the date the child is placed with the claimant having attested that they consider the placement a permanent one and that they intend to adopt the child.6. Temporary or permanent custody of a child Parental benefits may be payable if a child is placed with a claimant who has been awarded permanent or temporary custody of that child because circumstances exist that renders the legally recognized parent(s) incapable of caring for the child if:the claimant attests that they consider the placement a permanent one and that it is their intention to adopt the child, and the child was placed with the claimant by a recognized authority. Parental benefits are payable effective the date the claimant attests that it is their intention to adopt the child that was placed with them by the recognized authority or in cases where the child is legally adoptable, from the date the claimant provides proof that an official adoption file has been opened for the purpose of adopting the child for whom they are claiming parental benefits.7. Legally recognized parents In some situations, a claimant who is not the child's biological or adoptive parent, may still be recognized as the child's legal parent. If that person is recognized as the child's legal parent on the provincial or territorial birth certificate, that person will be eligible to receive parental benefits, provided the qualifying conditions to establish a claim have been met. If the claimant cannot be recognized by the province as a parent on the birth registration, that person will not be entitled to parental benefits unless an adoption process has been started or, in cases where the child is not legally adoptable, from the date the claimant attests that it is their intent to adopt the child placed with them.8. Native custom adoption governed by the Indian Act  Parental benefits are payable in respect of a native custom adoption when the adoption is governed by the Indian Act.Canadian courts have long recognized the notion of native custom adoption. In doing so, the courts have provided the following criterion that can be applied to determine if a custom adoption has taken place:there is consent between the natural and adopting parents;the child has been voluntarily placed with the adopting parents;the adopting parents are indeed native or entitled to rely on native custom; andthe rationale for native custom adoptions is present.The rationale for native custom adoptions has been held by the court to mean that it is necessary for the survival of child whose parents were unable to care for them, or who had died. Other jurisprudence has noted that the term rationale for native custom adoption means that there is a recognized reason within the scope of the custom, whether it be to provide for children without parents, or otherwise, for the adoption to take place.If the adoption does not meet the criteria listed above, it must be clear that the claimant has officially opened a file with a recognized adoption authority for the purpose of adopting the child for whom they are seeking parental benefits or, in cases where the child is not legally adoptable, from the date the claimant attests that it is their intent to adopt the child placed with them.9. QuÃ©bec Parental Insurance Plan Since January 1, 2006, maternity and parental benefits have been available under the QuÃ©bec Parental Insurance Plan. There is a regulatory provision providing that a person who is entitled to receive benefits from a provincial plan in respect to the birth or adoption of a child is disentitled to maternity or parental benefits under the EI program in respect of this same birth or adoption (Regulation 76.09(1)).The regulatory provision is respecting individuals claiming benefits under different plans, as in the context where one of the parents is residing outside Quebec and the other parent is residing in Quebec at the beginning of the period for which the first parent claims benefits in respect of the birth or adoption of their child (Regulation 76.21).Eligible parents can share the number of weeks of parental benefits payable under the EI program and the parental or adoption benefits payable under the QuÃ©bec Parental Insurance Plan for a same birth or adoption of a child.According to the regulation, the maximum number of weeks of standard parental benefits that can be paid to a parent cannot exceed the maximum number of  40 weeks less the number of weeks of provincial benefits that have been paid to the claimant governed by the provincial plan, taking into account, where appropriate, the weeks of benefits that are paid at the accelerated rate under the provincial plan.  An EI parent cannot receive more than 35 weeks of standard or 61 weeks of extended parental benefits.In cases of extended parental benefits, the maximum number of weeks of benefits that can be paid to a parent are determined by using the following formula:(A-B) x C/DFor the purposes of the above formula, A is 40, the maximum number of weeks of standard parental benefits when the weeks of benefits are divided; B is the number of weeks of provincial benefits that are paid to the claimant governed by the provincial plan, taking into account, where appropriate, the weeks of benefits that are paid at the accelerated rate under the provincial plan; C is 61, the maximum number of weeks of extended parental benefits payable per benefit period; and D is 35, the maximum number of weeks of standard parental benefits payable per benefit period (EI Act 12(3)(b)(i) and (ii)).",37.12779353652337,18.31923249475071,18.011747272446712,23.07235807347706,22.15701083766971,12.170755767700877,70.88694132529963,12.229508196721312,3.1718899851925606,0.8950443605588698,0.4701727904817355,0.0568280165775525,0.8252732143426935,0.8100167698526787,4.879077167859984,4.0,2.6712797801604324,41.21311475409836,35.0,28.57782859175305,1.511535401750199,1.0,0.814585973128093,2514,456,0.1813842482100238,12462,61,13.1.2,Who can receive parental benefits,Chapter 13 - Parental benefits
779,779,"As already indicated parental benefits are unique in that they may be paid to biological, legal or adoptive parents or may be shared between the parents. Like all claims for unemployment benefits a waiting period must be served (EI Act 13) before parental benefits can be paid under the EI Act.The waiting period may be waived if, after having ceased work, the claimant received sick leave paid by his employer (Regulation 40(6)) or when the claimant works for more than one employer, if he was paid sick leave pay after ceasing work from one of these employers and had an interruption of earnings for the same employer. Additionally moneys payable by an employer as parental leave pay are not considered to be earnings in the waiting period (Regulation 39(3)(b)).The Employment Insurance legislation provides that only one waiting period must be served in respect of the same child. In situations where the first parent made a claim for benefits, served the waiting period and during this benefit period, claimed maternity and/or parental benefits, the waiting period can be deferred for any other parent  claiming parental benefits in respect of the same child (EI Act 23(5)).When parents decide to share parental benefits and apply simultaneously, they may choose which one will serve the waiting period.  This allows the other parents to defer their waiting periods.  Note that a deferred waiting period is not the same as a waiting period that is waived; a waiting period that is deferred must be served before a parent can receive regular, sickness, compassionate care or family caregiver benefits on the same claim.It should be noted that a claimant is only required to serve one waiting period when claiming benefits in respect of one new-born or adoptive child. In the event that a second benefit period is required to ensure the claimant can receive all parental benefits the legislation allows, the waiting period can be deferred on the second claim.Waiving the waiting period should not be confused with deferring the waiting period. In the event that the waiting period was waived for the first parent, another parent would be required to serve the waiting period as a waiting period was not previously served in respect of the same child. The only exception to this would be in a situation where the other parent also received sick leave pay from his employer or when the claimant works for more than one employer, if he was paid sick leave pay after ceasing work from one of these employers and had an interruption of earnings for the same employer, the conditions have been met to waive the waiting period.A regulation in the context of the implementation of the QuÃ©bec Parental Insurance Plan authorizes waiving the waiting period where benefits have been paid under a provincial plan such as the QPIP (Regulation 76.22).",43.35503511011812,16.42311203319502,15.299343439825492,19.727034790935207,19.87671879987233,11.825726141078832,63.4254707947654,9.76923076923077,3.154994736231301,0.5042077039374033,0.4106698973008568,0.0349780288244828,0.887048676609993,0.8930579315532338,4.83402489626556,4.0,2.544509177373315,37.07692307692308,36.0,17.428807004768498,1.487551867219917,1.0,0.789486559349036,482,160,0.3319502074688796,2365,13,13.1.3,Waiting period,Chapter 13 - Parental benefits
780,780,"Under the EI program, parental benefits are payable to parents to care for one or more new-born children or one or more children placed with the claimant for the purpose of adoption (EI Act 23(1)).Parental benefits therefore provide a means of financial support that allows parents to be away from work to care for the child.The parental legislation has evolved over the years to where it no longer makes any reference to remaining at home to care for the child. It is unreasonable to expect a parent to cease all regular activity and simply remain at home for 35 or 61 weeks doing nothing more than caring for the child. While the intent of the legislation is to allow the parent to bond with and care for the child, the requirement of caring for the child is met when the parent is providing for the needs of the child. This means a claimant may leave the home for periods of time and continue to receive parental benefits, whether the child is with the parent during these activities or not. A reasoned approach should be taken and each case should be decided on its own merit having regard for the intent to allow a parent to care for the child. It has been argued that a child who is admitted to hospital cannot be considered to be in the care of the parent, therefore no entitlement to parental benefits exists. The reality of this situation is that the parent continues to be responsible for the child. Furthermore, in many cases the parent's presence and assistance is specifically requested by either the doctor or the hospital.This same reasoning holds true for those claimants who decide to take a vacation while in receipt of parental benefits. Because payment of these benefits has no tie to availability, a claimant can indeed be on vacation and be entitled to parental benefit. Similarly, the reason for separation from employment is not a factor in determining entitlement to parental benefits as any disqualification imposed on a claim will be deferred or suspended during receipt of parental benefits (Digest 13.3.4).",51.72445692883899,13.414831460674158,14.790194502661404,17.484644194756555,15.352462546816476,10.603707865168538,53.82397003745319,7.166666666666667,2.986787792839224,0.5866686930131405,0.5002460794445837,0.0493238448677571,0.9092375202612444,0.8985269725322723,4.660112359550562,4.0,2.6930380465117087,29.666666666666668,30.0,10.55409346599171,1.4775280898876404,1.0,0.8258809132791624,356,162,0.4550561797752809,1684,12,13.1.4,To care for a child,Chapter 13 - Parental benefits

The legislation recognizes this distinction and provides that parental benefits in respect of an adoption are payable beginning with the week in which the child is actually placed with the claimant for the purpose of adoption, not from the day that the adoption certificate is issued. The adoption process covers a period during which the legal rights and obligations normally in place between the biological parents and the child cease to exist and are replaced by similar rights and obligations between the adoptive parent(s) and the child.There is no requirement in section 23 of the EI Act  that an application for adoption be submitted to the court for a claimant to qualify for parental benefits. What must be demonstrated is that the child has been physically placed with the claimant and that this placement was made with the objective that the child will be adopted by the claimant. When a claimant can demonstrate that there is a commitment to adopt, the placement will be considered to be made for the purpose of adoption.In cases of international adoption, the adoptive parent may be required to personally bring the child from the country where that child is located, or even spend a certain amount of time there in order to comply with the adoption rules of that country. The adoptive parent who is in another country for the purpose of adoption may receive parental benefits starting at the time that the child is actually placed with the claimant, that is, starting at the time that the child is physically under the claimant's care (CUB 16706). The placement must be made in accordance with the applicable provincial laws.A declaration signed by the claimant identifying the adoption authority and the date of placement is sufficient proof that an adoption is proceeding. Proof of the placement is requested only in circumstances in which questions arise with respect to the adoption.",47.46953612479476,15.0434236453202,16.424793381693185,19.937274220032844,18.3290065681445,11.841674876847293,62.89737274220033,9.833333333333334,3.081772138097218,0.7107144586603957,0.4943125826065757,0.058260442896839,0.9099623398347334,0.9109993278980256,4.849753694581281,4.0,2.727272846767069,33.833333333333336,31.5,15.550098249064396,1.477832512315271,1.0,0.8264418548425292,406,141,0.3472906403940887,1995,12,13.1.5,Week in which the child is born or actually placed with the claimant,Chapter 13 - Parental benefits

Of course even when the claimant is within this window, no benefits are paid if he/she is no longer eligible or not entitled to them or if the claim has exhausted by duration. Parental benefits are not payable or cease to be payable after the end of the week in which the death of the child occurred.The standard parental benefits window begins with the week in which the child is born or placed with the claimant for purposes of adoption and ends 52 weeks after that week. The extended parental benefits window begins with the week in which the child is born or placed with the claimant for purposes of adoption and ends 78 weeks after that week (EI Act 23(3.21)).This window can be extended if the newborn or child placed for adoption is hospitalized during this 53 or 79-week period. The window may be extended by one week for each week or part week during which the child or children are in the hospital, up to a maximum of 104 weeks (EI Act 23(3); EI Act 23(3.1).

In cases where extended parental is the only benefit paid on the claim, a 26 week extension of the benefit period will be added to allow for payment of the full entitlement.A maximum of 102 weeks of combined special benefits can be paid in an extended benefit period if:No regular benefits have been paid during the initial benefit period; and More than one type of special benefits was paid; and at least one of these special benefits was paid for fewer than the applicable maximum number of weeks payable for these special benefits, andThe maximum total number of weeks payable for the types of special benefits requested is greater than 50.If a specific type of special benefits was not paid during the initial benefit period, it cannot be paid during the extended benefit period.The initial benefit period ends on the earlier of:When 50 weeks of special benefits have been paid; orBenefit period start date plus 51 weeks plus any weeks of extension due to work-sharing or for one of the following reasons Confined in a jail, penitentiary or other similar institution and was not found guilty of the offence for which the claimant was being held or any other offence arising out of the same transaction;In receipt of earnings paid because of the complete severance of their relationship with their former employer;In receipt of workers' compensation payments for an illness or injury;orIn receipt of payments under a provincial law on the basis of having ceased to work because continuing to work would have resulted in danger to the claimant, her unborn child or a child whom she was breast-feeding.It is important to note that for the purpose of the extension of the benefit period, when reference is made to benefits paid for a pregnancy or caring for a child, this also refers to the provincial benefits that have been paid to the claimant for the same reasons. This means that QuÃ©bec Parental Insurance Plan benefits can be used to extend the EI benefit period to allow the claimant to receive the maximum number of special benefits weeks under the EI Act, other than maternity or parental, to which he/she is entitled.A claimant who does not qualify for regular benefits under the EI Act, but qualifies for special benefits because of the regulatory exception, can only receive special benefits in their benefit period.The limit to the number of weeks of special benefits payable also includes benefits paid under the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan. According to a specific regulatory provision, each week of Quebec Parental Insurance Plan benefits paid is considered as a week for which benefits are paid under the EI program, and is taken into consideration in calculating the overall maximum number of weeks of EI maternity or parental benefits to be paid per benefit period, and the maximum number of weeks of EI benefits to be paid regarding a birth or an adoption.",18.32459938366719,24.028181818181825,21.439077682325905,29.115562403697997,28.09996147919876,12.001694915254234,83.63636363636363,16.09090909090909,3.921381435304321,1.1561683499204067,0.483533547562371,0.071664259038217,0.8974256396293641,0.9109961986541748,4.822033898305085,4.0,2.560559247482443,53.63636363636363,47.0,36.2673725826615,1.5847457627118644,1.0,0.8589140876360525,590,199,0.3372881355932203,2883,11,13.2.1,Limits to the number of weeks of special benefits payable,Chapter 13 - Parental benefits
787,787,"A maximum of 50 weeks of benefits at 55% can be paid in the initial benefit period, when regular and special benefits are combined.  Claimants who receive regular benefits and choose to receive extended parental benefits may be paid the equivalent of 50 weeks at the 55% benefit rate0  In order to determine when the 50 week cap has been reached, once 50 weeks of benefits have been paid, any weeks of extended parental benefits paid at the 33% benefit rate will have to be converted to the equivalent number of weeks that would have been paid at the 55% benefit rate.  This conversion will help determine how many more weeks of regular benefits and special benefits can be paid to reach the equivalent of 50 weeks paid at 55% and what the applicable benefit period extension should be.  Any benefit period extensions will be added at week 52 of the claim.  As stated in EI Act Section 10(13.02), the extension applied to facilitate the payment of extended parental benefits cannot exceed 26 weeksThe conversion table from extended parental benefits weeks to standard parental benefit weeks is included in Annex 1 . The conversion table from standard parental benefit weeks to extended parental benefit weeks is included in  Annex 2.These annexes are found at the end of this chapter. Only benefit types that were paid in the initial benefit period can be paid in the extension period provided all entitlement conditions are still met . For the purposes of calculating the cap of 50 weeks, weeks in which the claimant returns to work or does not receive benefits for a reason other than those listed in subsections 10(10) to (12.1) and section 13 of the EI Act, whether during the initial benefit period or extended benefit period, will be deemed to be weeks for which benefits were paid at a weekly benefit rate of 55%.  For example: if the claimant returns to work for two weeks during the initial benefit period these two weeks will be weeks deemed paid for the purposes of calculating the cap of 50 weeks paid at 55%.  The conversion calculation should occur at the point where the claimant reaches 50 weeks paid or  deemed paid on the claim. As stated above, for the purpose of calculating the cap, we would not include weeks in which the claimant did not receive benefits because the claimant was: Confined in a jail, penitentiary or other similar institution and was not found guilty of the offence for which the claimant was being held or any other offence arising out of the same transaction. In receipt of earnings paid because of the  complete severance of their relationship with their former employer.In receipt of workers' compensation payments for an illness or injury.In receipt of payments under a provincial law on the basis of having ceased to work because continuing to work would have resulted in danger to the claimant, her unborn child or a child whom she was breast-feeding.Serving the waiting period.Additionally, weeks of extension for the hospitalization of a child or weeks in which members of the Canadian Forces have had to defer their parental leave or end it early to return to active duty, are not included in the calculation of the cap of 50 weeks paid at 55%.Worksharing weeks are not included in the calculation of the 50 weeks paid at 55% when regular and special benefit, including extended parental benefits, are combined during the initial benefit period.  Example 1:A claimant becomes ill and receives 10 weeks of sickness benefits. He then applies for extended parental benefits and receives 15 weeks.  The claimant is laid off from his employment in week 26 of the claim and applies for regular benefits. After proving his availability for work, the claimant receives 25 weeks of regular benefits up to week 51 of the benefit period.  As the claimant received regular benefits and extended parental benefits in the initial benefit period, a conversion calculation must be completed to determine the cap of 50 weeks and the benefit period extension.At week 51, using  the table found in Annex 1,  the 15 weeks of extended parental benefits paid in the initial benefit period are converted to 9 weeks of standard parental benefits.  In order to determine how many weeks at the 55% benefit rate can still be paid  within the 50 week cap, 10 weeks of sickness benefits, 9 weeks of converted parental benefits and 25 weeks of regular benefits must be subtracted from the cap of 50 standard weeks.  At week 51 there are 6 weeks of benefits that can still be paid at the 55% benefit rate. At week 52, the benefit period is extended by 6 weeks to allow the claimant to be paid up to the equivalent of 50 weeks at 55%. Example 2: A claimant is laid off from their employment and establishes a claim for regular benefits.  After receiving 36 weeks of regular benefits, the claimant converts their claim to extended parental benefits and receives 10 weeks of benefits.  The claimant becomes ill and requests 2 weeks of sickness benefits before resuming payment of extended parental benefits. The claimant receives two more weeks of extended parental benefits before 50 weeks of benefits are paid on the claim.At week 51, using the table found in Annex 1,  the 12 weeks of extended parental benefits paid in the initial benefit period are converted to 7 weeks of standard parental benefits. In order to determine how many weeks at the 55% benefit rate can still be paid within the 50 week cap, 36 weeks of rgular benefits, 7 weeks of converted parental benefits and 2 weeks of sickness benefits must be subtracted from the cap of 50 standard weeks.  At week 51 there are 5 weeks of benefits that can still be paid at the 55% benefit rate.As the claimant is being paid extended parental benefits at week 51, it needs to be determined how many weeks of extended parental benefits would be equivalent to five standard weeks of benefits in order to determine the benefit period extension.  Using  the table found in Annex 2,  the 5 standard weeks are converted to 8 weeks of extended parental benefits. The benefit period is extended by 8 weeks to allow for the additional weeks to be paid. Example 3:A claimant applies for extended parental benefits and receives 35 weeks of extended parental benefits.  She then converts her claim to regular benefits and receives 5 weeks of regular benefits.  The claimant then returns to work for 5 weeks at which point she renews her claim for regular benefits.  As weeks in which the claimant returns to work are deemed weeks paid for the purposes of calculating the 50 week cap, the claimant reaches 50 weeks paid or deemed paid after receiving five more weeks of regular benefits.At week 51, using the table found in Annex 1,  the 35 weeks of extended parental benefits paid in the initial benefit period are converted to 21 weeks standard parental benefits.  In order to determine how many weeks at the 55% benefit rate can still be paid within the 50 week cap, 21 weeks of converted parental benefits, 10 weeks of regular benefits and 5 weeks during which the claimant returned to work must be subtracted from the cap of 50 standard weeks.  At week 51 there are 14 weeks of benefits that can still be paid at the 55% benefit rate.  A 14 week extension will be added to the claim at week 52 to allow for the additional weeks to be paid.",50.73200166805675,13.568315262718931,16.133371291317395,18.863386155129277,14.812283152627188,9.89354740061162,56.79149291075896,8.045454545454545,2.9452227751823443,0.6167050567214082,0.4894948246825163,0.0696940702514859,0.8535222009170887,0.8415688560122535,4.5389908256880735,4.0,2.56162748521414,29.727272727272727,24.0,16.216382900639875,1.488532110091743,1.0,0.8187537994642453,1308,252,0.1926605504587156,6008,44,13.2.2,Limits to the number of weeks of special and regular benefits payable,Chapter 13 - Parental benefits

As long as the parent is providing for the needs of the child, it is acceptable to attend a course of instruction or other employment activity while in receipt of parental benefits, as availability is not a factor in determining entitlement to receive parental benefits. The individual can still be considered to be taking care of their child when she/he does so outside the hours of this other activity. However when the claimant's reason for not working is not, or ceases to be, to care for the child, entitlement to parental benefits is not proven and the claimant may be subject to a disentitlement   .

796,796,"Historically, teachers were not considered unemployed for the duration of their employment contract, and their annual salary was allocated over the entire period of their contract, including periods during which they did not teach (non-teaching periods). The Commission has always maintained that benefits are not payable to teachers during any non-teaching periods.In 1980, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that teachers are only paid for the days they teach (S.C.C. 15540, 1980, FCA A-267-77). The Court also found that teachers have an interruption of earnings and a separation from employment during non-teaching periods. Consequently, earnings can only be allocated to days that a teacher actually teaches.To maintain the original intent not to pay regular benefits during non-teaching periods, to claimants who are engaged in the occupation of teaching a regulation was introduced, limiting entitlement to EI benefits to very specific situations (EIR 33). The regulation providing for the payment of maternity, parental, compassionate care and family caregiver benefits during the non-teaching period also provides that certain conditions must be met before regular and sickness benefits can be paid during any non-teaching periods.This chapter and the accompanying annexes are intended to clarify the entitlement to EI benefits, of teachers during these non-teaching periods.

798,798,"EIR 33(1) defines teaching as the occupation of teaching in a pre-elementary, elementary or secondary school, including technical or vocational schools. Therefore, anyone who teaches at those levels or schools, regardless of the time spent in teaching, the subject, or the individuals being taught, is considered a teacher for the purposes of the regulation.This definition applies to all teachers employed in school service centres, schools under provincial or municipal boards, as well as teachers in independent or private schools. Teaching at the post-secondary or university levels does not fall within the definition of a teacher, pursuant to the regulation. Although they are teachers, they do not fall under the provisions of EIR 33. Instead, they are subject to the same qualifying and entitlement rules as any other claimant.Other employees of school boards and of school service centres, although part of the education systems, are not subject to this regulation because they are not in the occupation of teaching. This could include administrative and clerical staff, maintenance technicians, caregivers in a daycare, school bus drivers, teachers' assistants, and school principals, as long as their duties do not require them to teach any part of the curriculum.",48.09742776381913,12.730345477386935,14.37465228746014,16.181155778894475,15.835590452261307,14.005628140703518,62.060929648241206,9.25,3.3507605226735557,0.6683911479139956,0.4389074716977861,0.0690415708328966,0.8911505937576294,0.8960334658622742,5.271356783919598,5.0,2.935955182305109,24.875,24.0,7.833222516946649,1.5778894472361809,1.0,0.9093117215089463,199,102,0.5125628140703518,1081,8,14.2.1,Teaching defined,Chapter 14 - Teachers
799,799,"The non-teaching period is defined as the period that occurs annually, at regular or irregular intervals, during which no work is performed by a significant number of people engaged in teaching (EIR 33(1)). Generally, a school year is comprised of teaching from September through June, with July and August as the primary non-teaching period. Within the teaching period of September to June, the non-teaching periods are normally the Christmas break and the mid-winter, or spring break.A disentitlement under this regulation would apply to non-teaching periods only. Other sections of the Act would apply to a claimant's entitlement to EI benefits during teaching periods. Information on the provisions relating to entitlement during periods outside of the non-teaching period can be found in Chapter 4 and Chapter 10 of this digest.A statutory holiday is not in itself a non-teaching period. However, a statutory holiday that falls within a non-teaching period will be included and considered as part of the non-teaching period. For example, Good Friday and Easter Monday are statutory holidays that become part of the non-teaching period if they fall within the period of spring break.The provisions of the regulation only apply to the periods during which no work is performed by a significant number of teachers. The non-teaching periods may vary among provinces, and may even vary from one school to another within a region, a province, a school board, or a district. For example, a private school may not have its spring break at the same time as the public school board in the same area. However, the spring break for the private school is still considered a non-teaching period.The test is whether it can be determined that a significant number of the claimant's teacher colleagues are not at work during a specific period. This criterion will not be met where there is no noticeable difference in the number of people teaching during specific periods of the year, compared to other periods.Where year-round schooling exists, the year is usually divided into 4 instructional periods of roughly equal duration, separated by breaks. These breaks are the non-teaching periods for teachers working in year-round schooling.",60.09323529411765,10.342941176470593,10.718039707386858,12.00855614973262,12.452540106951872,11.421283422459894,49.27272727272727,6.0,3.0486100257506394,0.555681433377585,0.4402064409568205,0.0794570041438975,0.8844657093286514,0.8484875758488973,4.858288770053476,4.0,2.6129507286198,22.0,23.0,6.154864169189802,1.4705882352941178,1.0,0.7370567109495099,374,148,0.3957219251336898,1873,17,14.2.2,Non-teaching period defined,Chapter 14 - Teachers

801,801,"Entitlement to benefits for Early Childhood Educators (ECEs), like all other claimants, is considered based on the specific employment circumstances of the individual. Individuals whose duties include teaching any part of a school curriculum, are considered to be employed in the occupation of teaching (including ECEs), regardless of the level being taught or the title of their position. The job description, workplace, duties and responsibilities of ECEs vary between regions within Canada (some teach, some do not).  As a result, a decision regarding entitlement to EI benefits cannot be rendered based solely on the job title the claimant uses.In accordance with the EI Regulations, a claimant who is employed in teaching is not entitled to receive EI regular or sickness benefits unless they meet one of the exceptions specified in EIR 33(2). In other words, once it has been determined that a claimant is employed in teaching, the provisions of EIR 33 must be considered to determine whether they are entitled to benefits for any non-teaching period during which no work is performed (in other words, spring break, summer break, and Christmas break).

These are:the contract of employment for teaching has terminatedall of the claimant's employment in teaching during their qualifying period was on a casual or substitute basis, orthe claimant qualifies to receive benefits in respect of employment in an occupation other than teachingThe first determination that must be made is whether EIR 33 applies to a claimant at the time an initial claim for benefits is made. If the claimant has not had any teaching employment during their qualifying period, EIR 33 cannot be used to determine entitlement to benefits. In these cases, entitlement would be assessed based on the same considerations as any other claimant who worked in an occupation other than teaching. This is true even if the claimant later signs or agrees to a teaching contract, that covers non-teaching periods in their benefit period. Entitlement to benefits for other non-teaching periods, during which the claimant may have a teaching contract, will be assessed based on other sections of the legislation (EIA 11 - week of unemployment; EIA 18 - availability for work). Once it has been established that a claimant falls under the provisions of EIR 33, what must be examined is whether they meet any of the exempting conditions set out in EIR 33(2). Each of these exemptions is considered separately. Once the claimant has met any one of the conditions, they may, subject to other eligibility criteria, become eligible for EI benefits during their non-teaching period.A teacher who does not meet any of the exemptions set out in the regulation is not entitled to receive benefits during the non-teaching period, unless they meet the qualifying and entitlement conditions to receive maternity, parental, compassionate care or family caregiver benefits.Each exemption is discussed in detail in the following sections.",36.63655043586556,16.39255292652553,16.581925556534415,19.95765877957659,19.36901867995018,13.529534246575338,64.9626400996264,10.545454545454543,2.900128707008573,0.6550214808585778,0.4487092725923934,0.0396193703201089,0.8763792753219605,0.8813325431611803,5.13972602739726,4.0,2.982999305471904,33.18181818181818,27.0,19.07315191484989,1.6136986301369862,1.0,0.9223726208219536,365,153,0.4191780821917808,1919,11,14.3.0,Disentitlement and relief conditions,Chapter 14 - Teachers

804,804,"A contract for teaching can be either written or verbal. It is reasonable to conclude that a new contract exists when the employer has made a bona fide offer of employment to teach in the next teaching period (in other words, the employer had a vacant teaching position to be filled during the next teaching period), and the teacher accepted the offer. A simple expectation of a job offer is not considered a genuine offer of employment. For example, an invitation to a general recruitment session during the summer non-teaching period does not constitute a genuine offer of employment, even though there is a strong possibility that a teacher will be offered a teaching contract for the next school year.Where a teacher verbally accepts an offer of employment, a delay in signing the contract until a later date during the non-teaching period does not negate the fact that a contract for teaching has been concluded. In this case, it is considered that the teacher has a new contract as of the date the offer was made by the employer and verbally accepted by the teacher.The contract can be for full-time teaching, for a few days each week, or even a few hours each day (CUB 70467; FCA A-511-95, CUB 28420).

805,805,"To conclude that a contract for teaching has terminated, there must be an absolute break in the teacher's employment. This question usually arises during the summer months (FCA A-811-00, CUB 49720; FCA A-664-01, CUB 49701). To determine whether there is an absolute break in the continuity of the teacher's employment during a non-teaching period and therefore conclude that the contract has terminated, 2 factors must be considered.The first factor relates to whether, before the end of the current contract, the teacher has  entered into a new contract or come to a verbal agreement to return to teaching at the end of the non-teaching period (FCA A-261-05, CUB 63467; FCA A-151-01, CUB 50649). If there is no new contract or verbal agreement to return to teaching, then there is an absolute break in the teacher's employment at the end of the current contract. The claimant will then be entitled to benefits from the day following the last day under contract.However, where a contract for the next teaching period is signed or verbally agreed to during the non-teaching period, and benefits had been allowed for the non-teaching period, a disentitlement under EIR 33 will apply as of the date of the signature of the contract or verbal agreement, if it is established that linkages exist (Refer to second factor).Where the teacher has a new contract or agreement to return to teaching at the end of the non-teaching period, whether it was accepted prior to or after the end of their previous contract, a  second factor must be examined.",49.26420074349444,15.934689325544344,12.28987398476788,18.04800849707913,19.49580987785449,10.534572490706315,64.45087626128519,10.0,3.632923798018822,0.9527379838114858,0.4269037428764689,0.0287909996713696,0.7845525940259298,0.8830844759941101,4.609665427509293,4.0,2.6011256284350046,38.42857142857143,30.0,28.10621254586732,1.4014869888475836,1.0,0.6413258953962508,269,109,0.4052044609665427,1282,7,14.3.1.2,Continuity of employment,Chapter 14 - Teachers
806,806,"The second factor is to determine whether linkages exist between the contracts. The determination of the existence of linkages between contracts will assist in confirming whether there has been a complete severance of the employer-employee relationship at the end of the first contract. If the teacher is rehired or an agreement is made to return to teaching after the non-teaching period, there may be continuity in the teacher's employment (FCA A-151-16; FCA A-510-14; FCA A-101-98, CUB 40255). Even if the new contract is signed or agreed to verbally prior to the end of the previous contract, the Commission must look for other elements of continuity or linkages between the 2 contracts, before imposing a disentitlement.The Commission cannot simply rely on the existence of repetitive contracts to disentitle a teacher for the non-teaching period. There must be additional evidence of contract linkages and continuing attachment to the previous contract.Elements to take into consideration when determining whether there was an absolute break in the continuity of a teacher's employment could include linkages such as:the carry forward of seniority from one contract year to the next;the carry forward of pension contributions from one contract year to the next;retention of sick leave credits from one contract year to the next;group insurance premiums paid by the employer over the summer period;access to group insurance plans during the non-teaching period (FCA A-367-04, CUB 60821).Under the terms and conditions of a collective agreement, employee benefits, such as medical and dental benefits, could continue after termination. Some teachers may maintain medical and dental coverage through their union after termination, for which premiums may be paid by either the employee or the union. These benefits, on their own, do not equate to linkages. However, if medical or dental benefits are continued through the employer, then these are considered linkages.If a contract for the next teaching period was signed, or a verbal agreement was reached before the end of the current contract, and linkages exist between contracts, a disentitlement will be imposed from the start of the non-teaching period because it is considered that the contract in teaching has not terminated. If a new contract is signed or a verbal agreement is reached after the end of a previous contract and linkages exist between the 2 contracts, a disentitlement will be imposed from the date the new contract is signed or the agreement is reached. Both factors, the existence of a contract/verbal agreement and linkages, must be present to support a disentitlement.Where a teacher is employed under separate contracts with 1 or more school boards, all contracts must terminate before the teacher can be entitled to benefits during any non-teaching period.A finding that continuity of employment exists, normally results when the employment is with the same employer or school board, even if the teaching location or school has changed. In some provinces, however, a teacher can accept a contract from a different school district for the following school year and carry over such benefits as medical or dental, or accumulated sick leave from their previous contract. In these situations, the details of the provincial agreements, as well as the agreements of the different school boards or districts must be examined to correctly determine whether there is continuity of employment between one school board/district and another.The fact that a teacher is not working, does not mean that a contract of employment in teaching has terminated. This may include when a teacher is suspended, on an approved leave of absence with or without pay (CUB 65820), on educational leave, sabbatical leave, sick leave (CUB 73507; FCA A-80-95, CUB26698), maternity leave, or any type of leave, including deferred salary or self-funded leave (FCA A-676-93; CUB 23386). As long as the contract is valid, a teacher is subject to the regulation during any non-teaching period (CUB 68435; FCA A-681-90, CUB 14246A).",43.78260876132933,15.37549546827795,15.043977024124086,18.49679758308157,18.904788519637457,12.99885196374622,66.03051359516616,10.9,3.4930293729336777,0.911295114825093,0.4250249307302736,0.0518752386936692,0.8865863837693867,0.8800201945834689,5.049848942598187,4.0,2.845294781582409,33.1,30.0,20.344286667268527,1.5302114803625375,1.0,0.8216259121802857,662,236,0.3564954682779456,3439,20,14.3.1.3,Linkages between contracts,Chapter 14 - Teachers
807,807,"Pursuant to EIR 33(2)(b), a teacher may be entitled to benefits if all of their employment in teaching during their qualifying period was on a casual or substitute basis.The words casual or substitute must be given their usual dictionary meaning. This general interpretation may differ from particular definitions found either in provincial legislation or in labour agreements.Employment on a casual basis refers to employment that is not regular or permanent, but is temporary or occasional. The teacher is generally on-call, with no set pattern of work, to perform the duties of another teacher for a short duration, and not in a continuous or predetermined way. If the employment involves filling an unexpected or temporary absence for a short period, and if the replacement of the absent teacher can end at any time without notice, the replacement is of a casual nature, for the purpose of applying the regulation.Employment on a substitute basis occurs when a teacher replaces another teacher on a temporary basis, for instance during a leave of absence, vacations or illness. However, if the teacher's employment as a substitute becomes fixed or regular, or subject to a temporary full time or part time contract, regardless of the terms of that teaching contract, whether for a few days each week or a few hours each day, the employment can no longer be considered as substitute.A teacher cannot benefit from the exception in the regulation based solely on their status of casual or substitute given by the school board, or under the terms of the collective agreement. The exception in the regulation emphasizes the performance of the employment and not the status of the teacher who holds it (FCA A-103-06, CUB 65192).For example, a teacher may have a casual or substitute status but during the qualifying period, enter into a contract that is not on a casual or substitute basis, but is on a regular full time or part time basis. In this situation, the teacher cannot benefit from the exception in the regulation since not all of the employment in the qualifying period was held on a casual or substitute basis.For the purpose of the exempting condition in EIR 33(2)(b), all of the teaching employment in the qualifying period must have been on a casual or substitute basis. Once a casual or substitute teacher signs a contract for teaching, regardless of the terms of that teaching contract, the employment no longer falls under the category of casual or substitute. If a teacher has met the condition that all of their teaching employment in their qualifying period was on a casual or substitute basis, they will be exempt from a disentitlement for all non-teaching periods during the corresponding benefit period.A teacher who does not meet the definition of casual or substitute teacher falls under the provisions of EIR 33(2)(a). Therefore, the guidelines set out in section 14.3.1 of this chapter apply. That teacher will be relieved from disentitlement when their contract terminates or if they qualify to receive benefits with respect to employment in an occupation other than teaching.There may be situations where a teacher was employed on a casual or a substitute basis and no contract existed for the school year that just ended, but a contract is signed or agreed to for an upcoming teaching period. That teacher would not be subject to a disentitlement for any non-teaching periods. In this situation, the claimant will have met both of the conditions set out in EIR 33(2)(a) and (b) for the current non-teaching period. The teacher would also be exempt from disentitlement during any other non-teaching period during their benefit period, as once the condition in EIR 33(2)(b) is met, it is considered to be met for the entire benefit period. The claimant could, however, be subject to disentitlement under other sections of the act and regulations.There are situations where claimants hired as substitute or replacement teachers year after year sign 10-month contracts each year for these positions. In these cases, the claimant is a teacher under a contract, regardless of the fact that it is a contract as a replacement teacher, or that, for the purpose of their collective agreement, they are referred to as a substitute teacher by their employer. These teachers are disentitled from benefits unless the relieving condition of contract termination is met (EIR 33(2)(a); FCA A-151-01, CUB 50649).Therefore, when a claimant had teaching employment during their qualifying period both on a casual or substitute basis, and under a contract that was still in place at the end of the school year, a disentitlement is imposed, until it is proven that the contract has terminated as defined in section 14.3.1 of this chapter.There may be situations where a teacher is hired under a contract that could be terminated at any time, to teach part time or by the lesson, for the full school year. These teachers are still under contract during the non-teaching periods that fall within their contract period, as a contract to teach part time or by the lesson is not casual or substitute teaching.

Teaching at the post-secondary or university levels is considered employment in an occupation other than teaching, as teaching at these levels does not fall within the definition of a teacher pursuant to EIR 33(1).The qualifying conditions to receive benefits require the claimant to have a sufficient number of hours of insurable employment in their qualifying period, in an occupation other than teaching, that would allow them to establish a benefit period. The claimant must also have an interruption of earnings in their qualifying period, from employment other than teaching.The amount of weekly EI benefits and the number of weeks that may be payable for a teacher who qualifies with employment in an occupation other than teaching is based on the insurable earnings and hours of insurable employment in the other employment (EIR 33(3)).

812,812,"Historically, the Commission's position, which is based on the Supreme Court Decision S.C.C. 15540, (FCA A-267-77) has been that teachers are not paid for periods of leave within their contract. As a result, the Commission did not allocate earnings during any non-teaching days.However, in a later decision, the Federal Court ruled that the allocation of a teacher's salary must be done in accordance with existing regulations (FCA A-113-98, CUB 40009). This would be the case when the contract specifies that, during the period of employment, a teacher is paid for days other than teaching days, such as statutory holidays, non-working and vacation days (currently EIR 36(5)). In that decision, it was considered that the entire teaching period was being remunerated, thus allowing for the allocation of earnings for non-teaching days, pursuant to the regulation.This means that earnings of a teacher can be allocated, not only to teaching days, but also to any other non-teaching days, as specified in the contract. A strict application of the Federal Court decision would have prevented the Commission from paying maternity, parental, compassionate care or family caregiver benefits during non-teaching periods, to teachers in similar situations. To respect the intent of the legislation and to strike a balance between the Supreme Court decision and the subsequent Federal Court decision, earnings are not allocated during the summer non-teaching period. As such regular, maternity, parental, compassionate care or family caregiver benefits can be paid during that period, regardless of whether the claimant accumulates insurable hours and/or earnings under their teaching contract for the summer non-teaching period.If it is stipulated in the teaching contract, that a teacher is paid for statutory holidays and/or other days, in addition to teaching days, the Commission's policy is to allocate earnings to all teaching and non-teaching days that fall in the teaching period (generally September to June) including the Christmas and spring break non-teaching periods. This means that generally, no earnings will be allocated in the summer non-teaching period (usually July and August).If the contract specifies that the teacher is paid for the entire teaching period, as was the case in the Federal Court decision mentioned above, allocation will be done proportionately over the entire teaching period, pursuant to EIR 36(5).If, however, the contract specifies that only certain non-teaching days are remunerated (for example only statutory holidays) monies paid for these non-teaching days will be allocated under the appropriate subsection, that is, statutory holidays would be allocated under EIR 36(13) and  vacation pay under EIR 36(8). No monies would be allocated outside the teaching period.Example: If a teacher files a claim during the Christmas break and the contract specifies that the teacher is paid for the statutory holidays as well as vacation days while the school is closed, thereby providing remuneration for the entire teaching period, the allocation of the total remuneration is made under EIR 36(5).If a contract specifies that a teacher is only paid for statutory holidays, and the teacher files a claim during the Christmas break, statutory holiday pay is allocated to Christmas day, Boxing day and New Year's day, pursuant to EIR 36(13), as not all of the non-working days in the teaching period are remunerated.As no earnings are allocated outside the period of teaching, (usually July and August) there would be no earnings allocated to the summer period and an interruption of earnings would occur. This policy maintains the current approach for the payment of maternity, parental, compassionate care and family caregiver benefits for teachers during the non-teaching period.It is important to note that EIR 33 must still be applied to all traditional non-teaching periods, to determine entitlement to benefits for a teacher who remains under a teaching contract.The intent is to allow for the payment of maternity, parental, compassionate care or family caregiver benefits during the non-teaching period. Therefore, the Commission's policy is to pay these types of special benefits during the summer non-teaching period, even if the client is accumulating insurable hours during that period.",33.12989446870455,18.12003639010189,15.973960126395564,20.565065502183405,22.012328966521103,13.834410480349344,70.7721979621543,12.444444444444445,3.746155315397797,0.6913845987696414,0.4278528579515885,0.0546816664779013,0.9019687070566064,0.9134698435664176,5.1717612809315865,5.0,2.717599165429809,38.16666666666666,31.0,25.81181899828061,1.5953420669577876,1.0,0.826688290275365,687,205,0.2983988355167394,3668,18,14.6.1,Allocation of earnings during non-teaching period,Chapter 14 - Teachers
813,813,"Generally, a claimant who accumulates hours of insurable employment while receiving EI benefits would have the earnings from those hours deducted from their benefits. However, as previously mentioned, in the case of a teacher who is paid for days other than teaching days, they may accumulate insurable hours during the summer non-teaching period, while no allocation of earnings is made for that period. This will allow EI benefits to be paid. To avoid situations where a teacher is paid benefits for the summer non-teaching period and, on a subsequent claim, receives credit for the insurable hours accumulated during that same period, the following applies:if a teacher files a subsequent claim after having received benefits in the non-teaching period, the record of employment will be reviewed to determine the number of insured hours and amount of earnings that fell in the non-teaching perioda determination will be made as to whether the teacher could qualify to establish the subsequent claim without the insured hours from the non-teaching periodif a teacher requests or requires credit for the insurable hours during the summer non-teaching period, an allocation of earnings will be done for the non-teaching period, pursuant to EIR 36(5) (FCA A-113-98, CUB 40009)if a teacher does not require all the insured hours during the non-teaching period, the allocation of earnings would only cover the hours needed for the subsequent claim. For example, if a teacher required 600 hours to qualify for benefits and only 560 hours fell in the teaching period only 40 hours from the non-teaching period would be used, and insured earnings would be allocated to the period covered by those hours. The balance of the hours from the non-teaching period would not be used in the calculation of the claim unless the teacher requested credit for all of those insured hours. In that case, an allocation of earnings would be done for all the earnings in the non-teaching period",32.81427710843373,20.46497418244407,15.719379583869454,23.067814113597247,25.21006884681584,12.196626506024092,74.8382099827883,13.0,3.3503742115099704,0.8390729588244966,0.4504659916372427,0.0644528512597508,0.8567458192507426,0.8680664300918579,4.867469879518072,4.0,2.507920390049831,47.42857142857143,31.0,49.37569426016681,1.4879518072289155,1.0,0.7623517182087084,332,117,0.3524096385542168,1653,7,14.6.2,Insurable hours during non-teaching period,Chapter 14 - Teachers

832,832,"Claims for unemployment benefits are filed by the thousands every day throughout Canada. To achieve the result aimed at by the Employment Insurance legislation, there is an obvious need to process these claims quickly so that benefit can be made available to claimants when they are in need of it. An important administrative body as is the Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC), in an effort to achieve the desired result, requires certain rules which must be strictly adhered to which will enable it to process the claims in an orderly manner. To be effective, these rules must apply in the great majority of cases. As a consequence, every Canadian has a duty to comply with the rules or at least make proper enquiries at the proper time to facilitate the administration of the plan.Delays in filing claims are not an uncommon occurrence in employment insurance matters. The Act and Regulations provide for time limits on the filing of claims and it is incumbent upon claimants to take such steps as are necessary to make sure they are conforming to the statutory requirements. It is only in exceptional circumstances that failure to file within prescribed delays may be waived.

867,867,"A penalty is not meant to be punishment. A penalty is meant to be a deterrent and to ensure individuals and employers neither benefit from nor repeat actions that risk the illegal payment of benefits   . Penalties are linked to overpayments, but can be imposed in situations when there is no overpayment. The Commission tests for misrepresentation to determine whether a penalty is applicable. The penalty applies to the individual or corporation responsible for the misrepresentation, and may be imposed on:the claimant;a person representing the claimant;the employer; ora person representing the employer.A penalty can be:non-monetary, in the form of a warning letter;monetary, calculated in accordance with the provisions of the legislation and the policy contained in this chapter; orthe judgment rendered as a result of formal prosecution.Only one kind of penalty can be imposed on a party for any one act of misrepresentation. For example, the Commission cannot first prosecute and later impose a warning letter for the same infraction. Similarly, the Commission cannot impose a warning letter and later decide to prosecute the same infraction.When a monetary or non-monetary sanction is imposed, the Commission may also issue a violation. When a warning letter is issued, if a violation is also issued, it is considered an unclassified violation   . When there is a second, third or greater incident of penalty, and a violation is also issued, the violation is classified as subsequent. Otherwise, violations are coded based on the value of the net overpayment   . In each case, except for an unclassified violation, the claimant will need additional hours to qualify for benefits over the next 260 weeks (5 years) or two subsequent claims. Violations and penalties are progressive; a subsequent infraction results in a more severe consequence.Finally, the decisions to impose a penalty or violation are discretionary and their consideration rests solely with the Commission. The Commission must exercise its discretion judiciously   . This means the Commission must take into account all relevant and ignore all irrelevant considerations and tailor the penalty to address the specific situation of the individual receiving the penalty. The written decision must identify what information was considered and why it was important or irrelevant in setting the final penalty amount and deciding to issue a violation.",42.47527831358502,12.32958666299256,14.77791319909322,16.31435657205842,13.343966657481396,13.59005235602094,54.39845687517223,6.894736842105263,2.8247468225202907,0.6861907139985325,0.4328396224685721,0.0795677752656108,0.8750833868980408,0.8432893262189978,5.24869109947644,4.0,3.298172723335973,20.105263157894736,18.0,7.999307449247718,1.7015706806282722,1.0,1.0609428010987216,382,179,0.468586387434555,2041,19,18.1.1,Scope,Chapter 18 - Policy on penalties

EIA 39(4) allows for a penalty the greater of:        $12,000.00; orthe penalty assessed against a person who claimed for benefits on the basis of an employer's false information, when that false statement affects conditions for qualification and entitlement   . EIA 39(5) and EIA 54(g.1) establish the Commission's right to make regulations in cases of major contravention. Since no regulations have been developed to date, these provisions are not applicable.For both employer and claimant penalties: EIA 40 restricts the Commission's right to impose a penalty in two circumstances. A monetary penalty cannot be imposed under EIA 38 or 39 if:        the Commission initiates a legal prosecution   ; orthe misrepresentation occurred more than 36 months ago. EIA 41 authorizes the Commission to change or remove a penalty when that penalty is later found to be inappropriate. This can mean there was a mistake or misunderstanding with regard to the original facts or that new facts are submitted. EIA 41.1 authorizes the Commission to impose a non-monetary penalty when a monetary penalty is too severe. EIA 41.1 also provides for the issuance of a non-monetary penalty, in the form of a warning letter, up to 72 months after the misrepresentation occurred   .The Commission's authority to impose a violation is created under EIA 7.1 EIA 7.1 authorizes the Commission to decide whether or not to issue a violation when a monetary or non-monetary penalty is adjudicated, or when a prosecution is resolved in the Commission's favour.",50.12965473145783,11.775865302642796,14.429720029161151,15.92838874680307,13.21619181585678,12.276627450980389,53.35038363171356,6.913043478260869,2.971274778180709,0.6507508918122556,0.4598952422647026,0.0804189175825113,0.7965469604188745,0.8010624448458353,5.0019607843137255,4.0,3.0231129389421403,22.17391304347826,20.0,8.364792540960483,1.5862745098039217,1.0,0.9637589007433418,510,199,0.3901960784313725,2594,23,18.2.1,Legislative authorities,Chapter 18 - Policy on penalties

878,878,"Sometimes evidence on a file is contradictory. In these situations, the Commission must look at all of the facts and decide if the contradictions can be explained; for example, 2 parties may recite the same series of events, but interpret those events differently. The Commission must decide which evidence is objectively true and which evidence results from interpretation and understanding. When there is no way to resolve the contradictions between 2 or more statements or bank of facts, the Commission must decide if one version of events is more believable than another.The standard of proof in establishing misrepresentation is the balance of probabilities   . A balance of probabilities means that, when all the facts are examined, one conclusion is more likely than the other   . For example, if the likelihood of snow is 51% and the likelihood of clear skies is 49%, then it is more likely it will snow, even though the difference in likelihood is very low. When considering a penalty, the Commission must establish that the evidence more likely concludes misrepresentation than not   . It is not sufficient to simply disbelieve a claimant's statement of innocence; the adjudicator must be able to identify evidence that contradicts the claimant's statement and state what facts override the evidence the claimant provides.To establish a false statement knowingly made   , the evidence must show:an objectively false statementthat misleads the Commissionresulting in the real or possible payment of benefits to which the claimant was not entitled, andat the time of the statement, the claimant knew it did not accurately reflect the factsA determination of misrepresentation is a discretionary decision. This means the Commission must consider any information provided and show how it concludes knowingly made and not innocent error. If the Commission considers a fact relevant, it must be able to explain why it is relevant. Similarly, if the Commission considers a fact irrelevant, it must be able to explain why it's irrelevant.Claimants may admit to misrepresentation, but provide an explanation about why they had no choice but to make a false statement. This is called a mitigating circumstance and is discussed in greater detail in 18.5.2. A mitigating circumstance does not change a finding of misrepresentation, or false statement knowingly made, to a finding of innocent error.

879,879,"Conclusions that rely on the balance of probabilities rest on a low threshold of likelihood in weighing evidence. There are times when the evidence on a file is too closely balanced to support a conclusion. When the Commission cannot decide whether one explanation is more likely than another, it resolves the file by accepting the claimant's statement as accurate. Employment Insurance legislation refers to similar situations as an application of benefit of the doubt   . In this case, benefit of the doubt means that when the evidence is equally balanced and the Commission can neither conclude nor disprove a finding of knowingly made, no penalty is imposed.Benefit of the doubt requires an assessment of the claimant's understanding   .

The Commission must show it considered all mitigating circumstances before imposing a penalty.An adjudicator looks at the individual file, reviews all the evidence, and ensures that all relevant factors are considered.

881,881,The Commission has a longstanding policy encouraging individuals to come forward and voluntarily disclose any misrepresentations. Under this policy a voluntary disclosure is a person's admission that he or she knowingly made a false statement or misrepresentation.,25.716959459459478,14.268243243243244,,18.210810810810813,16.3345945945946,18.197837837837834,56.33783783783784,7.0,2.5601023017902813,0.2659846547314579,0.4603580562659847,0.0690537084398976,0.8482850193977356,,6.054054054054054,5.0,4.324324324324325,18.5,18.5,2.5,1.9189189189189189,1.0,1.3432187718691002,37,32,0.8648648648648649,228,2,18.3.4,Voluntary disclosure,Chapter 18 - Policy on penalties
882,882,"A voluntary disclosure must meet 2 conditions:the admission must be authentic and there must be no investigation initiated or underway in relation to the voluntary disclosure, andthe offence would have resulted in a penalty, a warning letter or prosecution had there been no voluntary disclosureAn authentic admission means that the responsible party comes forward with the sole purpose of righting a wrong. He or she is aware that misinformation resulted in an inappropriate payment of benefits, and submits information to correct the situation. If any investigation is underway, it raises a question as to whether the disclosure is given freely or presented in an attempt to avoid the consequence of an investigation. Therefore, a finding of voluntary disclosure also depends on the absence of an investigation initiated or underway in relation to the voluntary disclosure. As well, case law confirms that when information is submitted for the purpose of gaining a benefit, it is not a voluntary disclosure. For example, the following would not be considered a voluntary disclosure:A claimant works while on claim but does not declare the work or earnings on their claimant report. The claim ends and the claimant submits the Record of Employment from the undeclared work to establish a new claim. The claimant advises they did not declare the work and earnings previously.In this case, the claimant does not submit the ROE for the purpose of correcting the undeclared earnings. The claimant submits the ROE to obtain Employment Insurance benefits. This is not considered an authentic voluntary disclosure.The second condition is that the original information must constitute a misrepresentation for which a penalty would be imposed if the Voluntary Disclosure Policy did not exist.For example, if a person voluntarily discloses a deliberate failure to declare vacation pay with other earnings on a claimant report, the Commission would normally impose a penalty for failing to declare earnings. Because the claimant came forward without other considerations, no penalty is imposed. This differs from an error correction, discussed below.The Commission does not impose a penalty when the voluntary disclosure policy is applied   . This means there is no monetary penalty, no warning letter, no violation, no interest charged on the debt arising from the overpayment and the misrepresentation is not used to determine if a repetitive misrepresentation occurs. The Commission provides a written notification when a disclosure is found to meet the conditions of the Voluntary Disclosure Policy.There is no time restriction on voluntary disclosure.

885,885,"A penalty is an administrative fine, imposed when a claimant, employer or third party is responsible for an action listed under EIA 38(1) or EIA 39(1). A penalty is distinct from an actual or potential overpayment. The Commission may re-consider a claim for benefits and create an overpayment without a finding of misrepresentation. However, a penalty can only exist if a claimant attempted to obtain or actually was paid benefits as a result of misrepresentation. In other words, an overpayment is a straightforward process; a claimant is either entitled or not entitled to the benefits. A penalty differs: it is triggered by an assessment of the claimant's subjective knowledge, based on the facts on the file.A penalty may be imposed on a claimant, an employer or an individual acting on their behalf in relation to a claim for benefit, when he or she has:knowingly made false or misleading representations or statements to the Commission, orcompleted a statement without declaring essential informationthat affects the payment of regular or special benefits or fishing benefits.

Claimants wishing to participate in the no cards program complete a single declaration to cover some or all of the weeks payable.

The Regulations   allows a no cards claimant to disclose information affecting entitlement to benefits as late as the end of the exempted period. Claimants wishing to know when the period of exemption reporting has ended, may consult MSCA.

As such, in cases where the claimant is paid by a  paper warrant (cheque), each warrant cashed can be counted as 1 count of  misrepresentation.However, unlike a paper warrant (cheque), a claimant who receives an electronic deposit cannot be said to have negotiated a warrant. As such, a different section of the Act applies to count misrepresentations. EIA 38(1)(f) states that a claimant knowingly failing to return the amount of or the excess portion of a special warrant as required by section 44, is an act to which a penalty applies.

893,893,"Cashing a paper warrant (as opposed to receiving a direct deposit) means that a claimant has negotiated and accepted the payment of Employment Insurance benefits. Under EIA 38(1)(e), the Commission can count every paper warrant that a claimant has accepted and cashed as 1 count of misrepresentation, as long as the facts show that the claimant understood that he or she had no right to receive that payment.As a result of the Federal Court of Appeal (FCA) decision A-1-09 - Canada v Tamber, EI payments made through direct deposit do not imply the negotiation of warrants. Therefore, to count a direct deposit as 1 count of misrepresentation, the Commission must instead impose a penalty under EIA 38(1)(f) on the basis that the claimant knowingly failed to return amounts paid to which there was no entitlement.The 1 week waiting period cannot be included in this count. EIA 38(1)(e) and 38(1)(f) are specific in their application: a penalty may be imposed for negotiating a warrant  or failing to return a direct deposit payment for benefits to which the claimant knew there was no entitlement. Otherwise, the technical count of misrepresentation can be assessed based on the number of 1or 2 week payments that processed through the computer pay system. Even if there is a single payment issued for multiple weeks, that single payment is an administrative convenience. The entitlement to those moneys is based on 1 or 2 week increments. As an example:a claimant renews a claim and declares that a loss of employment did not arise from quitting or dismissal. The claimant is paid based on that false information. If the adjudicator retroactively disqualifies the claim and determines the claimant made the misrepresentation knowing that an accurate statement would prevent payment of benefits, the adjudicator may also conclude that the claimant knew there was no entitlement to the subsequent benefits paid. Therefore, the adjudicator may impose a penalty for every 2 week declaration that resulted in a paper warrant or electronic deposit accepted and not returned after the false statement was knowingly madeNote: The Commission does not impose 2 penalties when a claimant both submits a claimant report and negotiates/accepts the payment for the same 2 week period.

Claimants who meet the conditions allowed by Regulation must show they remain available for work   , or otherwise available for work when in receipt of sickness benefits   , even though they are outside the country.To impose a penalty on claimants who do not declare their absence from Canada , there must be a finding of a misrepresentation   . Case law says the Commission bears the responsibility to prove an allegation of misrepresentation, and that the legal test is that, on a balance of probabilities, a false statement was knowingly made.When claimants complete their bi-weekly electronic reports, they are asked to acknowledge their responsibility to report any absence from Canada. The bi-weekly report asks claimants if they were outside Canada during the period of their report. Because of that question  and the  answer to that question,  the Commission can conclude that the claimant misrepresented the absence. If a conclusion of misrepresentation rests solely on the absence from Canada, a penalty will not be imposed unless the claimant admits to understanding he or she was not entitled to benefits during this period.Claimants who declare availability for work on their bi-weekly claimant report during their absence from Canada must prove they were available for work during that period   . The preamble to the claimant report draws a clear relationship between the ideas that being out of Canada means a claimant is not available. Claimants who maintain they remained available during an absence from Canada must prove this availability through an acceptable and credible written job search and evidence of their ability to work in the country in which work was sought, or of their ability to immediately return to Canada to accept an offer of employment.Similarly, when a claimant is absent from Canada for a reason permitted under EIR 55(1), but was absent for longer than the definite periods allowed under EIR 55(1), availability must be carefully examined to determine if the claimant genuinely meets the requirements of the Act for all days of the absence.Finally, a determination that the claimant incorrectly declared availability during an absence from Canada does not automatically conclude misrepresentation. If the claimant's explanation for the false statement is credible, it will not meet the condition of knowingly; therefore a penalty shall not be imposed. Strong fact-finding and sound documentation in the final decision must support a finding of misrepresentation. A declaration of availability for which the claimant can provide neither proof nor explanation will be considered a misrepresentation.",48.49357142857144,13.451428571428576,13.126405980863044,15.575,17.09774553571429,13.76348214285714,58.35714285714285,8.5,3.1753391640205386,0.8088047904037396,0.4737667386300553,0.0478338575213435,0.8679344773292541,0.8699767419270107,5.207589285714286,4.0,3.2035465128331144,28.0,24.5,10.665364503850771,1.5357142857142858,1.0,0.9881310951612088,448,179,0.3995535714285714,2359,16,18.4.4.7,Outside of Canada,Chapter 18 - Policy on penalties

A first level misrepresentation means there is no history of infraction; a second level misrepresentation occurs when it is a second incident; and a third level misrepresentation when it is a third.

Similarly, a penalty for a third incident of misrepresentation cannot exceed 150% of the net overpayment and can be reduced to any percentage amount between 0 and 150% of that overpayment.

For instance, if there is a conclusion of misrepresentation on a benefit period, and this is a first incident of misrepresentation the penalty cap is $5,000.00.For the purposes of the penalty cap, the level of misrepresentation can increase the level of infraction on a subsequent benefit period.

There is a determination of a second incident of misrepresentation on a second, benefit period, or claim.

905,905,"A claimant may submit a Record of Employment on which the Reason for Separation was knowingly altered, but the Commission identifies the misrepresentation before any benefits are paid. The claim is established with a benefit rate, but is disqualified-meaning no benefits are paid, so no overpayment occurs. Submitting a Record of Employment, knowing that the reason for separation was altered, even when no benefits were paid is serious enough to warrant a monetary penalty. Since there is no overpayment, the penalty is calculated based on a straightforward application of EIA 38(2)(a) by multiplying:100 / 200 / 300% (level of misrepresentation) bythe actual benefit rate by2 misrepresentations (1 count each for the application and the Record of Employment).First infractions are subject to a maximum penalty calculated at 100% of the benefit rate per false statement. Subsequent infractions of a similar nature are subject to higher penalty calculations based on 200% for a second misrepresentation, or 300% for a third or greater incident. Mitigating circumstances are considered, and the penalty is reduced by a percentage value if applicable.Violations are recorded based on the amount of the actual or potential overpayment. No real overpayment will occur if the Commission discovers the misrepresentation before benefits are paid. In this case, the potential overpayment is calculated based on the guidance at Digest 18.10.3.2. The violation is coded based on the potential overpayment. Violations are discussed in detail in section 18.10.If the Commission allows the reason for separation and sets up the claim free of disqualification, the misrepresentation must still be adjudicated.

908,908,"The link between claimant reports, benefits paid and misrepresentation is subject to special consideration. A claimant may submit an ROE and application that constitute misrepresentation and claimant reports that accurately declare no work or earnings. Therefore, the simple submission of claimant reports cannot be considered misrepresentative. However, the Commission can reasonably conclude that claimants who file a claim with false information know they have no right to receive benefits. Under EIA 38(1)(e) and 38(1)(f), accepting and cashing a cheque for benefits or accepting then failing to return a benefit amount electronically deposited are both offences for which a penalty may be imposed. When counting incidents of misrepresentation, the Commission does not include any claimant reports submitted   . The Commission must include every payment whether paid by paper warrant or electronic deposit, as a misrepresentation.As an example, a claimant submits:an application declaring a loss of employment due to shortage of worka Record of Employment altered from a quit to a lay-off3 claimant reports accurately declaring no work and no earnings for which the claimant accepts 3 paymentsThe application and Record of Employment are 2 counts of misrepresentation. The claimant reports are not misrepresentation. Keeping each of the 3 paper warrants or failing to return the  electronic deposits constitutes 3 counts of misrepresentation. Therefore, the legal validation amount would be based on 5 counts of misrepresentation.As long as the claimant report is accurately declared, the waiting period cannot be counted as misrepresentative because no warrant, or payment, was issued. However, if a claimant makes a false statement on the claimant report, a penalty may be considered for that false statement. Only 1 penalty can be assessed in respect of a claimant report period, whether it is considered because of misrepresentation on the claimant report or negotiating or failing to return the payment.",42.107793159609145,12.833804094927874,13.707050652182112,15.025500232666356,15.324220567705908,15.046514657980456,61.34225221033039,8.642857142857142,3.010687146457361,0.6575354687528995,0.4260135025788836,0.0586422635387456,0.8477880175297077,0.8521653761466345,5.47557003257329,5.0,3.6305645935441966,21.928571428571427,20.5,11.652493820847877,1.6840390879478828,1.0,1.1476527405118588,307,142,0.4625407166123778,1710,14,18.5.8,Claimant reports and payments,Chapter 18 - Policy on penalties
909,909,"When a claim is cancelled, there is no legal benefit rate. Therefore, no net overpayment can be calculated. This means a penalty cannot be calculated based on 50, 100 or 150% of the overpayment. For a cancelled claim, the Commission calculates the penalty based on EIA 38(2)(c).In this case, the penalty is limited to no more than 3 times the maximum benefit rate    that existed when the act or omission occurred per misrepresentation.

912,912,"Employer penalties are authorized under EIA 39 and subject to the same considerations of fact, balance of probabilities and mitigating circumstances as are claimant penalties. The same legislation applies to an employer as to a claimant with regard to amending or rescinding a penalty.By policy, the Commission imposes a penalty under EIA 39(4) only when the evidence concludes an employer issued or sold a Record of Employment when there was no employment relationship: this can mean no work was performed or no services provided. In very rare cases, it can also mean that an employer issued a Record of Employment knowing that the employee was not insurable.A penalty may also be imposed under EIA 39(4) when there was a genuine employment relationship, but the employer misrepresented information in a manner that allowed the claimant to qualify for benefits \u2014 examples of this would be increasing the hours of insured employment to meet the qualification conditions of EIA 7/7.1, or issuing a ROE knowing there was no interruption of earnings or recording a quit or dismissal as a lay-off. In other words, the correct information would have prevented payment of EI benefits entirely; the incorrect information did, or would have, resulted in benefits being paid.Any other employer misrepresentation, including situations when a Record of Employment is correctly issued but contains misrepresentative information - such as modifying the insurable hours to increase the number of payable weeks, or modifying the earnings to allow a higher benefit rate, or failing to correctly declare the reason for separation when issuing the ROE - is subject to penalty under EIA 39(2).A violation cannot be recorded against a corporation or a non-insured person. A violation may be recorded when the Commission imposes a monetary penalty or warning letter against, or successfully prosecutes, an insured person acting on the employer's behalf, or on a third party misrepresenting him or her self as an employer.Please note that although there is provision under EIA 39(5) and EIA 54(g.1) to impose a higher penalty for a major contravention, this provision can only be used if, and when, the Commission creates a regulation to govern how the clauses are applied.

918,918,"Third parties introduce a new element in the determination of who must repay an overpayment and penalty. The way in which a third party may be involved in a claim can be broadly divided:a third party may act on behalf of a claimant or employer, with or without consent or knowledge; ora third party may act on his or her own behalf, inappropriately using the information or identity of another individual or organization.Responsibility determines liability for an overpayment and penalty. If a third party acts entirely without the knowledge and consent of another individual or an employer, the third party is responsible for any repercussions from that action. In an extreme situation, this could be identity theft, or deliberate misrepresentation as an employer.However, a third party may act only as a channel by which information is communicated. For example, a third party may act as a translator for a claimant who has a language barrier, or complete a Record of Employment as directed by the employer. If the Commission determines the third party recorded the information, believing it was accurate, the third party cannot be held liable for any overpayment and is not subject to penalty. The claimant or employer is responsible for any debt incurred.Because a third party can be defined as a person who acts on behalf of an interested party, the most important consideration is whether the third party acted with the consent and knowledge of the interested party - in this case, the claimant or the employer. Just as a finding of misrepresentation determines whether a penalty applies on a file, the finding that consent exists determines whether a third party is liable for an overpayment and subject to penalty.",47.48545454545459,13.140353535353537,14.811377253095038,16.861616161616162,14.752992424242422,11.897777777777776,57.43181818181819,8.181818181818182,2.626682473175887,0.5656201267461168,0.4709170220563121,0.062420432362656,0.8586111187934875,0.8608162668016222,4.902777777777778,4.0,3.1804949048074533,26.181818181818183,28.0,14.49650855656556,1.5694444444444444,1.0,0.9940991020473552,288,112,0.3888888888888889,1439,11,18.7.2,Defining third party responsibility,Chapter 18 - Policy on penalties
919,919,"Consent may be express or implied. It can be restricted to a single specific action, or it may be given for a broad range of activity. Consent may be granted by the claimant or employer, or it may be directed through a legal authority (such as the executor of an estate). Black's Law Dictionary defines consent as:Agreement, approval or permission as to some act or purpose, especially given voluntarily by some competent person.It further defines the terms:Express consent: consent that is clearly and unmistakably stated; andImplied consent: consent inferred from one's conduct rather than from one's direct expression.These definitions contain three critical components:permission must be given;that permission must be voluntary; andthe person giving consent must be competent.",49.58846994535523,11.394098360655736,14.06817628641468,15.346448087431694,13.406256830601096,13.541967213114752,58.85792349726776,7.833333333333333,2.759837764781984,0.5566997657322041,0.4589366572125193,0.0697990891475352,0.8438479661941528,0.8035513609647751,5.237704918032787,5.0,2.848794046519336,20.33333333333333,22.0,6.823163163486241,1.6147540983606556,1.0,0.8142855795764495,122,76,0.6229508196721312,664,6,18.7.3,Consent,Chapter 18 - Policy on penalties
920,920,"An express consent can be directly demonstrated. In the case of a claimant, this takes the form of a written authorization. This may be a letter, a power of attorney, or authorization to act on behalf of an individual incapacitated, but the evidence shares the characteristic of being an actual document in which the third party is formally and explicitly authorized to act on the claimant's behalf.There may be similar documentation available for the employer. It is most likely that express consent is captured by the conditions and duties of employment, and particularly through a written job description. An employee acts on an employer's express consent if his or her duties specifically include preparation and communication of payroll information that affects entitlement to Employment Insurance benefits. When considering a third party penalty relative to an employer, the adjudicator must be able to identify how consent exists in the terms and conditions of employment. This may be complicated when there is no written definition of job duties or if the employee's duties do not include the preparation and communication of payroll information. Verbal statements from the interested parties constitute evidence, and are examined to determine if there is one version of events that is more credible than the other(s). When determining responsibility, the adjudicator must reasonably demonstrate that an employee acted with the express consent, or under the specific direction, of the employer.For either the claimant or the employer, if express consent is not present, the evidence must be examined for the presence of implied consent.",38.93880792359394,13.632324018394057,15.549919911452193,17.438839759462326,15.176331800495229,14.049027237354082,60.32861690838345,8.636363636363637,2.9133613713684707,0.7297158800206512,0.4455243173549462,0.0580752690609308,0.8530198752880096,0.8527564472622342,5.291828793774319,4.0,3.237134271196451,23.363636363636363,24.0,10.200469929216965,1.7042801556420233,1.0,1.075958159234513,257,123,0.4785992217898833,1390,11,18.7.3.1,Express consent,Chapter 18 - Policy on penalties
921,921,"Implied consent means the evidence on a file supports that a third party was authorized to act on the claimant's or employer's behalf. The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities. This means that it is more, and not less, likely, that the third party was authorized to represent the claimant or the employer.For example, when a third party submits a claimant report using the claimant's Social Insurance Number and Access Code, the Commission can reasonably conclude that the third party acted with the claimant's consent. Claimants are reminded to keep their Access Codes private, since they are used as an electronic signature and identifier for the purposes of managing electronic data on a claim. A conscious decision to provide that information to a third party concludes the claimant gave that party permission, or consent, to act on his or her behalf. Once the Commission can reasonably conclude consent exists, the onus of proof falls to the claimant to show that such consent was not given for any particular false statement.If a claimant denies consent existed, other evidence may conclude or disprove that consent. For example, when a bi-weekly benefit is directly deposited into a bank account that bears the claimant's name, it raises a presumption that the claimant knew about the payment. This is particularly true if the claimant's name is the only one recorded on the account. Evidence must be examined and a conclusion of consent must be supported by that evidence. Similarly, a denial that consent existed must be supported by the evidence.If an employee has access to personnel or payroll files from which information is provided, it indicates the employee acted with the employer's consent. When an unauthorized employee is responsible for the misrepresentation, the employer must show what precautions prevent an employee from inappropriately accessing records or documents (such as Records of Employment). If the precautions are inadequate or non-existent, there is a strong presumption of implied consent.",55.74409523809527,10.932996960486324,13.5591,14.852360688956436,13.4016210739615,12.643647416413373,55.064032421479226,7.266666666666667,2.8398637324443774,0.6411868992727774,0.4551787945124108,0.0612371422860044,0.8546370097569057,0.8405973865435674,5.066869300911854,4.0,2.879826528980712,21.933333333333334,23.0,7.3798524526051485,1.5227963525835866,1.0,0.8613254565577149,329,149,0.4528875379939209,1716,15,18.7.3.2,Implied consent,Chapter 18 - Policy on penalties
922,922,"Except in cases where a claim for benefit is made on behalf of a person with mental disabilities, an incapacitated person or a deceased person, the legislation expects a claimant to make their own claim for benefit, prove entitlement to benefits and provide the Commission with any additional information about their claim. On occasion, claimants may, unbeknownst to the Commission, ask or allow a third party to act for them in relation to their claim for benefit.  Typically, this will occur when a claimant asks or allows a third party to complete their bi-weekly declaration to the Commission.  Problems arise when it is later discovered that representations made to the Commission by third parties, with or without the claimant's permission, were false or misleading. Section 38 of the Act allows the Commission to impose a monetary penalty on any person acting for a claimant if that person knew that the representation was false or misleading.In order to determine which party is liable to repay any overpayment arising out of the false representation, as well as which party is subject to a monetary penalty, the Commission must assess the extent to which the claimant asked or allowed the third party to act for them. The Commission must also determine whether or not both parties were aware that the representation was false.  Both parties must be questioned, all relevant details obtained and contradictory evidence clarified.If the claimant asked or allowed a third party to act for them and the third party unknowingly made a false or misleading representation to the Commission, the third party would not be responsible for any overpayment, and no penalty would be assessed against them.  However, if the claimant knew that the information provided by the third party was false or misleading, then the claimant would be responsible for any overpayment arising out of the representation and may also be subject to a penalty.However, if the claimant asked or allowed a third party to act for them and the third party made a false or misleading representation to the Commission, where both the claimant and the third party knew that it was false or misleading (collusion), then the claimant would be responsible for any overpayment arising out of the representation and both the claimant and the third party may be subject to a penalty.In addition, a third party may, without the claimant's knowledge or permission, either file a false claim for benefits based on the claimant's employment history or, once a legitimate claim is established for a claimant, make bi-weekly declarations to the Commission and direct those benefits to themselves.  In these types of situations the third party acts on their own and in effect becomes a claimant when they attempt to claim benefits that are not payable to them.  As such, the third party is responsible for any overpayment arising out of the misrepresentation and may also be subject to a penalty.In all of these cases, the adjudicator must record the rationale for any decision to penalize the claimant and/or the third party, including all of the factors that were taken into account, how the amount of the penalty was determined and any mitigating circumstances that were considered.",46.85668627450983,15.73341176470588,15.903189008614271,20.02137254901961,19.725189950980383,12.124485294117644,62.92107843137255,9.666666666666666,3.346369205414028,0.8878930660974969,0.4740758635370265,0.0594033925556609,0.9251099824905396,0.9180757219974812,4.887867647058823,4.0,3.0012742166718405,36.266666666666666,31.0,15.251083750198069,1.4558823529411764,1.0,0.9124760033816806,544,169,0.3106617647058823,2706,15,18.7.4,A claimant and third party (amended 8 July 2010),Chapter 18 - Policy on penalties
923,923,"EIA 39 allows for the imposition of multiple penalties in an incident of employer misrepresentation. Adjudication of employer and third party penalties range in complexity. The employer and the company may be the same. The employer may be a multi-national corporation. It may be difficult to say a corporate employer is capable of knowing that a misrepresentation was made. However, corporate employers have a responsibility to ensure only designated agents, or employees, can access sensitive documents such as the Record of Employment, and that only authorized employees disclose information that affects Employment Insurance claims. Negligence and carelessness in controlling information can be interpreted as implied consent, and simply being unaware of a misrepresentation does not relieve an employer of responsibility for a penalty. Conversely, a corporation may show appropriate controls are in place and that an employee abused the trust that an employer reasonably placed in that employee's integrity. When the evidence supports a genuine breach in the employer-employee relationship, penalizing the corporation may be inappropriate. The abuse of trust cannot translate to a situation in which the employer consented to their agent's action.Similarly, an employer may or may not be responsible for a misrepresentation that occurs because an officer or director of the corporation abuses his or her position in the company. If there is no express or implied consent, the penalty is most appropriately assessed against the third party. Although the Commission could impose a penalty against the corporate employer in any case in which abuse occurred, Commission policy restricts that penalty to the responsible party or parties. When the Commission determines the corporate employer is not implicated in the misrepresentation, the Commission will issue a caution letter. This does not mean the Commission cannot penalize both the employer and the employer's representative. Rather, the Commission must determine whether responsibility for a false statement lies within the employer's control before determining the degree to which penalties against multiple parties are appropriate.",33.33481707317074,13.70256097560976,16.218646115125612,18.44390243902439,15.098353658536588,15.562195121951216,59.21951219512195,7.9375,2.664475092781124,0.4344695611409798,0.457968151571996,0.0796799801982517,0.892883837223053,0.8670184441975185,5.579268292682927,5.0,3.43934330816708,20.5,18.5,7.913595895672207,1.804878048780488,1.0,1.138987830405061,328,155,0.4725609756097561,1868,16,18.7.5,Employer and third party,Chapter 18 - Policy on penalties
924,924,"A director, officer or agent of the employer may be an active or passive party in misrepresenting information to the Commission. These individuals may be employers within the meaning of EIA 39, or may be considered third party representatives, depending on the exact nature of the misrepresentation. The legislation specifies the conditions under which such an individual may be penalized. One or more of the following acts must be proven:the person directed/ordered the misrepresentation;the person authorised the misrepresentation;the person agreed to or accepted that the false statement would be made (i.e., assented to them);the person knew about the misrepresentation and silently accepted it (i.e. acquiesced to them); or,the person actually participated in the misrepresentation.In other words, if a representative of the company actively participates in, or passively allows misrepresentation, that representative is subject to a penalty. This penalty may be in addition to any other penalty assessed. The test is whether the Commission can establish express or implied consent from the employer in the representative's actions. If consent can be shown, both the employer and the representative are subject to a penalty. If consent cannot be shown, Commission policy restricts the penalty to the officer, director or agent.A third party penalty for a corporate representative is calculated in the same way any employer penalty is calculated.

925,925,"EIA 41.1 authorizes the Commission to issue a warning letter instead of imposing a monetary penalty. A warning letter may be imposed on a claimant, an employer or a third party. In an employer situation, a warning letter can be imposed only if the misrepresentation is adjudicated under EIA 39(2). The wording of EIA 41.1 does not allow a warning letter to be issued when a penalty is adjudicated under EIA 39(4). Warning letters are considered a penalty within the meaning of the Employment Insurance legislation, but do not carry the greater consequence of a monetary sanction. Warning letters are subject to different time restrictions, and may be issued up to 72 months following the misrepresentation.A warning letter is issued:when the Commission is of the opinion that circumstances are so mitigating that any monetary penalty is punitive; orwhen the infraction(s) occurred more than 36 months prior to their discovery; orby policy, when the final penalty amount is less than $20.00 when all calculations and mitigating circumstances are taken into account.Warning letters carry no immediate consequence. There is no monetary penalty attached to a warning letter. Neither do the increased entrance requirements, discussed below, apply unless there is a subsequent misrepresentation for which a monetary penalty is imposed.If there is a situation in which subsequent misrepresentation is discovered, the warning letter and any previous unclassified violation, count in determining there is repetitive misrepresentation. For example, if there is only a non-monetary penalty (the warning letter) and an unclassified violation, but the subsequent misrepresentation triggers a monetary penalty and a violation, the penalty will be considered at a second level and calculated at 100% of the overpayment. The violation will be coded as subsequent.",39.53009615384616,13.24930555555556,14.10635816964678,15.528205128205128,14.685152243589748,14.121805555555556,57.917735042735046,7.923076923076923,3.0002114822586035,0.9910204784969736,0.4216012880227267,0.0462576984342592,0.8617647389570872,0.829677776856856,5.315972222222222,5.0,3.4461363872064603,22.153846153846157,19.0,13.76084832942948,1.7118055555555556,1.0,1.0591529980614085,288,127,0.4409722222222222,1566,13,18.8.0,Warning letters,Chapter 18 - Policy on penalties

932,932,"A potential overpayment is calculated    based on the value of benefits that could have been paid to the claimant if he or she had not been disentitled or disqualified or had met the qualifying conditions. The potential overpayment is used only to code the value of a violation when a penalty is assessed for misrepresentation relating to qualifying conditions    or the presence of disentitling or disqualifying    conditions that affect payment of benefits. Potential overpayment refers to a monetary value calculated by multiplying the benefit rate by the average number of weeks of regular benefit . A potential overpayment never affects the amount of an overpayment or the penalty calculation.A potential overpayment can be calculated when:there are still weeks of regular benefits payable on the claima benefit rate is establishedthe misrepresentation is discovered while the claim is active, or may be re-activatedthe misrepresentation affects entitlement, qualification or qualifying conditionsIt is important to remember that a potential overpayment only exists when the misrepresentation is discovered in time to prevent further payment on a claim. There must also be the possibility of further payment following the disqualifying or disentitling event. Thus, a disqualifying event discovered after a claim has exhausted the 52 week window of duration cannot have a potential overpayment, as there is no possibility of payment on a claim that has ended.EIR 13 creates the legislative framework by which the term average number of weeks of regular benefits is defined. It says the average number of weeks is calculated by:taking the number of weeks of regular benefits that were calculated as payable under EIA 12(2) or EIR (Fishing) 8subtracting any weeks in which benefits were actually paid, anddividing the result in halfA week of regular benefits restricts the calculation by excluding any weeks of sickness, maternity, parental, compassionate care or family caregiver benefits that may be payable in the benefit period under review. The term regular benefits refer to the weeks of benefit that directly result from the claim calculation. This is an arithmetical calculation that considers hours of insured employment and the regional rate of unemployment. Entitlement, or the right to receive the benefits calculated, depends on a claimant being ready, willing and able to seek and accept work. This differs from special benefits in which a claimant may meet a threshold requirement and be entitled to the maximum weeks of payment allowed for that kind of benefit   .",29.969731619731647,16.85685503685504,18.8141640860857,22.154526554526555,19.150971460971466,14.373759213759213,65.7057267057267,10.76923076923077,2.9691400709698264,0.7874730960473024,0.4994722925898981,0.0562073826328137,0.8891453842322031,0.8870603821494363,5.292383292383293,4.0,3.33037778446219,31.307692307692307,23.0,18.40729209761349,1.714987714987715,1.0,1.0733979834186895,407,166,0.4078624078624078,2173,13,18.10.3.3,Calculating the potential overpayment,Chapter 18 - Policy on penalties

The claimant or employer may assert the information originally provided was not false, or that the explanations provided are sufficient to negate a finding of knowingly made. They may also argue that mitigating circumstances were not correctly considered and that the failure to reduce the penalty fails the test of a judicious decision.When a decision related to an appeal must be reconsidered, the policy that was in effect at the time of the original decision applies.Because the imposition of a penalty and the issuance of a violation are fully discretionary, the legal test at appeal is that the Commission correctly exercised its discretion. Case law consistently holds that discretion must be exercised judiciously. This means the evidence shows that the Commission appropriately considered all the information provided. If an explanation is credible, the Commission cannot dismiss it. Similarly, if an explanation has no bearing on the matter, the Commission cannot include it in determining the finding of misrepresentation, in the calculation or reduction of the penalty amount, or in the issuance of a violation.The documentation must show the Commission correctly addressed these factors at the time of the initial decision, and in any amendment.If a penalty and violation are successfully appealed, the Commission must review any penalties and violations imposed subsequent to the appealed decision.

943,943,"A claimant who is referred to a course or program of instruction or an employment activity under the employment benefits (Part II) needs to meet the definition of an insured participant. An insured participant for the purposes of the employment benefits provisions  is defined as being an unemployed person:for  whom a benefit period is established or whose benefit period has ended within  the previous 60 months, or,who paid, in at  least 5 of the last 10 years, employee's premiums that did not entitle the  person to a refund under subsection 96(4) of the EI Act,  and,a claimant who  was in receipt of the employment insurance emergency response benefit within  the previous 60 months The Human Resources Investment Branch (HRIB) has clarified that a benefit period that is cancelled    cannot be used to meet the definition of insured participant because a benefit period that is cancelled is deemed never to have begun   . Consequently, the cancellation of a benefit period could affect a person's eligibility for employment measures where that person has no effective benefit period. It should be noted that when a new benefit period is established, canceling a previous benefit period does not create a problem: the claimant can now meet the definition of insured participant because a new benefit period is established.To be eligible for employment benefits, while their names are on a waiting list for a course or for an employment activity or while their proposal for a Self-Employment agreement is under consideration, claimants must be able to prove that they are unemployed and available for work.Once a claimant is referred to a course or program of instruction or an employment activity pursuant to an authority delegated by the Commission, he or she is deemed to be unemployed, capable of and available for work for the duration of their participation in the course or program of instruction or employment activity   . This legislative provision is a clear and specific exception to the general rule set out in the sections dealing with capability, availability and the state of being unemployed   .Consequently, these claimants will be considered unemployed, capable of and available for work for any day or during any period for which the referral to the course or the employment activity by a designated authority remains in effect. This is so even if they are in fact absent for part of the course or the employment activity, or the course or the employment activity is interrupted, for example during the summer break, provided the referral remains in effect.Nonetheless, all claimants referred to such training or activity must still fulfill all other provisions under the Employment Insurance Act and Regulations.There are no legislative provisions that would enable a person to demand that he or she be referred to a course or an employment activity. Referral is a discretionary power that only the Commission or its designate, may exercise when it deems it appropriate. Jurisprudence    recognizes that neither a board of referees nor an umpire has the authority to make decisions in this area other than to determine whether the authorization was duly granted by the designated authority.The decision to refer or not a claimant is not subject to appeal   .",31.47240802675589,19.4181884057971,18.8141640860857,24.086064659977705,22.91560618729097,12.35963768115942,72.5340022296544,12.76923076923077,3.543594475534692,0.8701329653102757,0.4448026122381951,0.0584550975247228,0.908671701947848,0.8887966871261597,4.907608695652174,4.0,3.033713956295161,42.46153846153846,35.0,30.175423990687385,1.5634057971014492,1.0,0.857385642331698,552,214,0.3876811594202898,2732,13,19.2.0,Referred claimants,Chapter 19 - Employment benefits and support measures (Part II of theEI Act)

960,960,"Employment Assistance Services (EAS) provide employment interventions that help clients prepare for, find, get and keep jobs.As already stated to receive unemployment benefits (Part I) a person must be unemployed, capable and available for work. The only exception to this is when a person is attending a course or program of instruction or training or is participating in an employment activity to which that person was referred   , in which case the claimant is considered unemployed, capable of and available for work. This exception cannot apply to claimants who are participating in EAS since, by HRIB policy, they are not referred under the Act. Therefore, claimants participating in EAS have to be unemployed, capable and available for work as any other person claiming unemployment benefits.Availability is assessed on a case by case basis, taking into consideration the particular circumstances of each. What is important to remember is that it is not the fact that a person is on training or participating in EAS (which could be a job finding club) that makes that person not available, rather it is the restrictions that the person imposes towards the acceptance of employment that may render that person not available for work.Jurisprudence has provided numerous examples of what available for work means. A claimant shows availability for work when he or she establishes a willingness and readiness to accept any employment for which he or she is suited by skills, training and aptitude and for which there is a demand in the labour market. Jurisprudence has also defined availability as either a sincere desire to work, demonstrated by an attitude and conduct, and accompanied by reasonable efforts to find a job, or as a willingness to reintegrate into the labour force under normal conditions without unduly limiting the chances of work   .",45.13198514851487,14.491686468646863,15.247664890283003,18.06059405940594,17.456534653465347,12.855973597359736,59.34290429042905,8.8,2.812476049712449,0.5580375709230762,0.4861012285123897,0.0381763932744686,0.86537766456604,0.8494643419981003,5.03960396039604,4.0,3.156806650080254,30.3,22.0,15.78005069700348,1.5478547854785478,1.0,0.924646227256354,303,141,0.4653465346534653,1554,10,19.2.17,Employment assistance services,Chapter 19 - Employment benefits and support measures (Part II of theEI Act)

965,965,"The Commission has a discretionary write-off authority (EI Regulation 56). This discretion must however take into consideration all the pertinent information and be exercised in a judicious manner. Therefore, when all the prescribed conditions are met, the overpayment, in whole or in part, must be written off.The primary condition to consider when deciding if an overpayment may be written off is whether it arises from a false or misleading statement or representation made by the debtor, or from an error on the part of the debtor (EI Regulation 56(1)(e); 56(2)).It is not necessary that the statement or representation be knowingly made as required when considering whether to impose a penalty. The fact that there is a false or misleading statement or representation, even if made inadvertently or in error, is sufficient to refuse the write-off of the overpayment.The write-off of overpayments should not apply to situations where the Commission paid benefits in error and the claimant ought to have known they were not entitled to all or some of the benefits, but did not take steps to advise the Commission in order to rectify the situation. A claimant has a duty and obligation to come forward in such situations. The defense that the Commission should not have paid benefits is not valid when a reasonable person should have known or realized that something was not right.  For example, a claimant's benefit rate was incorrectly calculated, and the claimant was receiving an amount almost equal to the wages they received while working.  As the claimant ought to have known that their benefit rate was too high, any overpayment created will not be written off.The common characteristics found in the situations and circumstances leading to an overpayment write off, are that the claimant cannot be held directly responsible for the events which led to the overpayment.  In other words, the claimant did not play a role in or have any real control over the events except to request and receive the benefits in good faith.A debt that has been written off is still owing and can, under certain circumstances, be revived. One such circumstance is when after a write-off, benefits become payable for the same period as the period for which the overpayment was established and written off.",53.98541237113403,12.614447717231226,14.244340213328725,16.549631811487483,15.22451399116347,11.592371134020611,53.74521354933727,7.214285714285714,3.13880310546836,0.6948840512838563,0.4275813194267543,0.0573520471208863,0.8573016019967886,0.8569954633712769,4.84020618556701,4.0,2.981079849801004,27.714285714285715,27.0,13.81732127971767,1.4742268041237114,1.0,0.8506247977210832,388,173,0.4458762886597938,1916,14,20.2.0,General principles,Chapter 20 - Write-off

The 12-month period is calculated from the date the claimant is notified of the overpayment in writing.When a decision is made which results in an overpayment and it has been determined that a portion of the overpayment is to be written off, the period will be calculated on the basis that the overpayment notice will be issued within the two weeks after the decision is made.This period of two weeks will be to the claimant's advantage, as it will account for delays in the issuance of the notice. If the claimant subsequently demonstrates that they were notified of the overpayment at a later date, the calculation and the amount to be written off will  be adjusted accordingly. However, there will not be a systematic review of claims in terms of increasing or decreasing the amount on the basis of the actual date of notification.For calculation purposes, the amount to be written off will include prior benefits that were payable, even though their actual issuance was later.

990,990,"In order to make a decision, the agent must assess the credibility or believability of the evidence to decide how much weight to place on the information and the impact it will have on the final decision.The weight of evidence cannot be determined by arbitrary rules, because it depends on common sense, logic and experience.Direct evidence, such as information provided by someone with first hand knowledge should be given more weight than information provided by someone with only second- or third-hand knowledge of the facts. Indirect evidence should not be used in isolation unless there is no direct evidence available and in general should be used just to confirm and strengthen the case.The following are general guidelines that may help in assessing the weight to be given to evidence. The most reliable form of evidence is an admission by the claimant of the existence of a fact that is exculpatory or prejudicial. However, in the case of misconduct or voluntary leaving a decision cannot be based solely on the claimant's statement. The agent must give the employer the opportunity to provide information as to the reasons for the loss of employment; and where any such information is provided, take it into account to determine the claim    . The three-step procedure    with respect to the gathering and consideration of evidence must be followed before making a decision on entitlement.Faced with conflicting statements from a claimant, the tendency should be to give more weight, or credibility to the claimant's first statement, especially when the first statement gave rise to a disentitlement. There is no hard and fast rule for automatically giving more credence to the first statement, so the agent must consider and weigh all evidence, and the conditions under which the evidence was given in each case.There is a difference between changing a statement and trying to clarify or expand on a prior statement. Often a claimant will attempt to clarify a prior statement that was brief or vague, or given in response to a general question; and people do sometimes change their minds. The claimant's subsequent statement should be accepted when it is credible and reasonable.Information from a source totally independent of the parties involved is usually more credible than that from someone who is related to one or other of the parties, or from someone who has something to gain or lose depending on the outcome. For example: payroll department, worker's compensation.While the agent should look at all available evidence, any information that is irrelevant to the issue at hand, or evidence that is so weak as to be ineffective, should be ruled out.For evidence to be relevant it must be applicable to the issue and there must be a logical relationship; it must have a bearing on the question at issue. Consideration should not be given to irrelevant facts.The degree of relevancy is important and it follows that the more relevant the evidence, the more weight is placed on it. The most acceptable test of relevancy is the question: does the evidence offered render the proposition more probable than it would be without the evidence?When you have evidence or information on a case and you think there may be additional evidence that is more credible, more relevant, or more direct and it is reasonably available, then steps to obtain that evidence must be taken.Increased credibility is given to a statement which was written and signed by the person giving the information because of the possibility of a misunderstanding when one party records or summarizes another's statement. Our clients should therefore be encouraged to write their own statements when possible. This practice may not always be practical especially if claim processing time will be impeded. However, it is especially advisable in those cases where there are conflicting statements, or where there are inconsistencies in the statements made.A statement written by the claimant will be less vulnerable to allegations of bias or partiality against the agent. Where this is not possible the credibility of a statement taken by the agent can be enhanced by:advising the claimant as to the purpose of the interview, i.e., to determine his or her initial or continuing entitlement to benefitadvising the claimant that a decision will be made on the claim based on the information givengiving the claimant the opportunity to raise objections or provide clarification as required and when possible,giving the claimant the opportunity to sign the statement indicating that all of the above took place and that he or she agrees with the statement as written. Otherwise the agent should document the file indicating that the above took place.These actions will lend support to the decision of the Commission and at the same time the claimant is less likely to retract the statement at a later date.",54.40842637781218,12.185665992143791,13.389495200839942,15.410371781137169,14.937441971193904,12.102484624846245,55.25409673451573,7.612903225806452,2.7984038255937644,0.6562900519796042,0.4627398333795838,0.0733483339634149,0.8588794112205506,0.8414666775999398,4.937269372693727,4.0,2.925016318749987,26.225806451612904,23.0,16.01352186166903,1.4870848708487086,1.0,0.8796695057187126,813,298,0.3665436654366543,4081,31,21.2.3,Evaluating the evidence,Chapter 21 - Evidence or proof
991,991,"After gathering and evaluating the available information, the agent will decide in favour of the version of the facts, which seems most credible given the circumstances. In some cases, the accounts of the parties are equally credible, making it impossible to choose one version over another. In such cases, preference is given to the version favourable to the claimant.Opinions, comments and interpretations of the evidence are often presented as facts and it is not uncommon for agents to mistake these for facts. Care should be taken to ensure that the facts and not the opinions are examined. There is an exception to this rule, in the case of an opinion given by an expert on some technical or professional point.For many years the terms burden of proof and degree of proof were used to define who must prove which facts.

993,993,"Doubt is a state of mind that exists when a decision is not definite but leans alternatively to either side; benefit is an advantage to be conferred on someone. To give the benefit of the doubt simply means to choose one side over the other. This normally applies when an individual fails to present conclusive proof, or when opposite accounts are equally believable. To come to a decision in such cases, the agent may draw reasonable inferences from all circumstances of the case, the evidence, and any other relevant factors.Where there is conflicting evidence, cases are usually resolved by a preponderance of evidence on one side or the other.

996,996,"There are many instances in the Act where a statutory requirement or a specific mention in the legislation determines which party is obliged to provide proof on a claim. For example, the Regulation     states that a claimant who alleges an incapacity for work is required to furnish a certificate completed by a medical doctor or other medical professional attesting to the claimant's incapability to work. Quite clearly, the claimant must provide proof to be eligible for sickness benefits. When the proof is not provided, there can be no eligibility.However, in the case of false or misleading statements, jurisprudence consistently maintains that the Commission bears the full weight of proof and is responsible for confirming that the person not only made false or misleading statements but also made them knowingly   . The Act    provides for imposition of a penalty in these instances. For example, when a claimant fails to report earnings on the report form, that report form is evidence that a false statement was made. However, before a penalty can be imposed the Commission must prove that the claimant knew that his or her statement was false.Objective questions such as Did you work? are generally easier to prove because they are based on tangible facts, e.g. earnings. Subjective questions such as availability are more difficult to prove, but in either case, the claimant must be given the opportunity to explain the statement: when the explanation is credible, it cannot be concluded that the statement was intended to mislead; when the reverse is true, the claimant becomes subject to a penalty.In all cases a thorough review of all available material relevant to the matter, including the verification and assessment of the credibility of the evidence must take place.

1025,1025,"The family caregiver window is established for a specific period of 52 weeks   . Once established, the claimant is entitled to a maximum of 35 weeks of family caregiver benefits for children or 15 weeks of family caregiver benefits for adults within that window. The weeks of family caregiver benefits do not have to be paid consecutively and can be paid intermittently during the benefit period or the 52 week window, in a manner that is most convenient to the claimant, provided the required medical proof supports the care recipient's critical illness during the weeks claimed.Legislation provides that no further family caregiver benefits can be paid after the end of the week in which any of the following occur:the benefit period has expired;the maximum number of weeks of benefits payable on the claim has been reached;the 52 week window has expired;the maximum weeks payable for family caregiver benefits for children (35) or adults (15) has been paid (either to one individual or shared);the critically ill care recipient no longer requires care or supportIn situations where the critically ill care recipient dies before the 52 week window ends, family caregiver benefits would cease at the end of the week in which the critically ill care recipient died. While entitlement to family caregiver benefits would cease at the end of this week, claimants may require additional time off to attend the funeral. The existing adjudication principles should be applied in these situations to determine if the claimant could be entitled to regular benefits, whether the funeral is in Canada or outside Canada.When a critically ill care recipient recovers, or the illness goes into remission, entitlement to family caregiver benefits ceases at the end of the week in which the claimant is no longer required to provide care or support to the critically ill care recipient.There will also be situations where the critically ill care recipient remains in the same condition after the initial 52 week window or later experiences a recurrence of the illness. When this occurs, an additional medical certificate could open a new 52 week window during which family caregiver benefits may be paid. However, it must be kept in mind that a claimant can only receive maximum weeks of family caregiver benefits for children (35) or adults (15) in a benefit period.For example: The 52-week family caregiver window closes, but only 25 weeks of family caregiver  benefits for children were paid in the claimant's benefit period. If the child is still critically ill, a subsequent medical could establish a new 52-week family caregiver window, which would start in the same benefit period. An additional 10 weeks of family caregiver benefits for children could be paid to this claimant, as only 25 weeks of these benefits were paid within the first family caregiver window in the current benefit period. Continuing the example above, if the claimant then qualifies to establish a new benefit period for family caregiver benefits for children, the remaining 25 weeks payable in the second window could be paid on the new benefit period. These benefits could also be shared with other family members, based on their individual entitlement.",40.08110062893084,16.446603773584908,16.32212239822248,20.17106918238994,19.795553459119496,12.773358490566036,64.0125786163522,10.133333333333333,3.223920553036029,0.7093186195068338,0.4563036013967237,0.0659199663784465,0.8944376451628548,0.8903148632783157,5.00188679245283,4.0,2.6878476039204737,35.333333333333336,30.0,22.623488285899285,1.5471698113207548,1.0,0.8482176148297744,530,170,0.320754716981132,2697,15,22.2.8,End of entitlement,Chapter 22 - Family Caregiver benefits

As long as the eligible claimant is providing the necessary care or support for the critically ill care recipient, and depending on the number of hours devoted to the course of instruction, it is acceptable to attend a course of instruction on the claimant's own initiative, while in receipt of family caregiver benefits, as availability for work is not a factor in determining entitlement to receive these benefits.The individual can still be considered to be providing care or support to the critically ill care recipient, when doing so outside the hours of another activity. The fact that a claimant may not provide direct care while devoting time to the course of instruction, does not mean that the claimant will automatically be denied benefits. However, when the claimant's reason for not working is not, or ceases to be, to care for the critically ill care recipient, entitlement to family caregiver benefits is not proven, and the claimant may be subject to a disentitlement. The circumstances of each case must be considered individually.There may be situations where it may be determined that a claimant is not meeting the condition of providing care or support to the critically ill care recipient.

A claimant can only receive a maximum of 26 weeks of compassionate care benefits per benefit period.The Act provides for the making of regulations to further define and determine what is care or support; who can issue a medical certificate; in which situations a shorter period than 52 weeks applies; when a waiting period can be deferred; and prescribing rules when family members do not agree on the division of weeks of benefits.Throughout this chapter, for ease of reference, the expression gravely ill family member, or patient, is used to describe a family member who has a serious medical condition with a significant risk of death within 26 weeks.",41.5754175101215,15.13060222672065,15.903189008614271,18.82773279352227,17.252398785425108,12.260404858299594,61.239372469635626,9.375,3.2682862400206414,0.770306480425804,0.4525817219869639,0.038074003513462,0.8468503781727382,0.7882160047690073,4.935222672064778,4.0,2.8090106336379077,30.875,35.5,14.225307553792993,1.582995951417004,1.0,0.87254243193679,247,117,0.4736842105263157,1243,8,23.1.0,Authority,Chapter 23 - Compassionate care benefits

It also includes situations where the claimant simply spends time each day with the seriously ill family member in the home, a hospice or a medical facility.Any period during which an individual is claiming this type of benefit is a time of great personal stress and the claimant may require a short break from providing care or support for the seriously ill family member in order to deal with this stress.

1056,1056,"The compassionate care window is established for a specific period of 52 weeks. Once established, the claimant is entitled to a maximum of 26 weeks of benefits payable within that window. The 26 weeks of compassionate care benefits do not have to be paid consecutively and can be taken intermittently during the benefit period or the 52 week window, in a manner that is most convenient for the claimant, provided the required medical proof supports the patient's illness during the weeks claimed.Legislation provides that no further compassionate care benefits can be paid after the end of the week in which any of the following occur:the benefit period has expired; the maximum number of weeks of benefits payable on that claim has been reached;the 52 week window has expired;the 26 weeks of compassionate care have been paid (either to one individual or shared); orthe seriously ill family member dies.In situations where the seriously ill family member dies before the 52 week window ends, compassionate care benefits would cease at the end of the week in which the seriously ill family member died.  While entitlement to compassionate care benefits would cease at the end of this week, claimants may require additional time off to attend the funeral. The existing adjudication principles should be applied in these situations, to determine if the claimant could be entitled to regular benefits, whether the funeral is in Canada or outside Canada.If the seriously ill family member recovers, or the illness goes into remission, entitlement to compassionate care benefits ceases at the end of the week in which the claimant is no longer required to provide care or support to the seriously ill family member.There will also be situations where the seriously ill family member remains in the same condition after the initial 52 week window, or later experiences a recurrence of the illness. When this occurs, an additional medical certificate could open a new 52 week window during which compassionate care benefits may be paid for up to 26 weeks. However, it must be kept in mind that a claimant can only receive a maximum of 26 weeks of compassionate care benefits in a benefit period. If the maximum has been paid this case, a new claim would may need to be established.For example, John has a benefit period in effect from January 3, 2016 to December 31, 2016.He applies for CCB to care for his seriously ill mother, and a CCB window is established from August 14, 2016 to August 12, 2017.  John collects 20 weeks of CCB from August 14 to December 31, 2016, at which time his benefit period ends.Tammie, John's sister, establishes a claim for CCB.  Her benefit period is in effect from June 18, 2017 to June 16, 2018.  She collects the remaining six weeks in the CCB window John established.

1072,1072,"Compassionate care benefits are payable to an eligible claimant who is providing care or support to a family member who has a serious medical condition, with a significant risk of death within 26 weeks.However, an individual claiming these benefits is not expected to cease all other activity. As long as the eligible claimant is providing the necessary care or support to the family member, and depending on the number of hours devoted to the course of instruction, it is acceptable to attend a course of instruction on the claimant's own initiative, while in receipt of compassionate care benefits, as availability for work is not a factor in determining entitlement to receive these benefits.The individual can still be considered to be providing care or support to a gravely ill family member when doing so outside the hours of another activity. The fact that a claimant may not be providing direct care while devoting time to the course of instruction, does not mean that the claimant will automatically be denied benefits. However when the claimant's reason for not working is not, or ceases to be, to care for the gravely ill family member, entitlement to compassionate care benefits is not proven, and the claimant may be subject to a disentitlement. The circumstances of each case must be considered individually.There may be situations where it may be determined that a claimant is not meeting the condition of providing care or support to the gravely ill family member. An example of this would be where the brother who requested and is receiving compassionate care benefits, leaves the gravely ill family member to the care of someone else in Ottawa, and relocates temporarily to Vancouver for a few weeks, to attend a course, thereby no longer providing care and support to the gravely ill parent for these weeks.

However, the plan does not offer sickness, compassionate care, family caregiver benefits for children or family caregiver benefits for adults. The EI program offers these types of benefits to QuÃ©bec self-employed persons.To access these special benefits under the EI program, QuÃ©bec self-employed persons are also required to register with the Commission and pay premiums (albeit at a reduced rate, in consideration of the fact that residents are already paying an annual premium to receive benefits through QPIP).In cases where a self-employed person residing in QuÃ©bec enters into an agreement with the Commission and then moves outside of QuÃ©bec, the person will have access to all EI special benefits, provided 12 months has elapsed from the time the person entered into an agreement. A regulatory provision was made to recognize the interprovincial mobility of these self-employed persons (EIR 76.43).

Since the agreement with the Commission was made between 12 months before their move and 3 months after their move, the claimant is eligible to apply for maternity and parental benefits without having to wait an additional 12 months.

1083,1083,"Once a self-employed person has been registered with the Canada Employment Insurance Commission (the Commission) for 12 months, and their agreement has not been terminated or deemed to have been terminated, they may qualify for special benefits (EIA 152.07(1)).  A claimant must first be able to establish a benefit period, which is the 52-week period, from the start date of an employment insurance (EI) claim, during which a claimant may be paid weeks of benefits to which they are entitled (section 24.4.0 of the Digest; EIA 152.1, EIA 152.11).  An application for benefits must first be completed, and the specific conditions for establishing a benefit period, called entrance requirements, must be met. These are:the person must have had an interruption of earnings (EIA152.07(1)(c);  EIR 14.01); and the person must have the legislated amount of self-employment earnings in their qualifying period (EIA 152.07(1)(d)).Once a benefit period is established, for each week they claim benefits, claimants must satisfy the specific conditions according to the special benefits that they are requesting. Additionally, they must continue to experience a reduction in their business activities (that is, a week of unemployment) for each week of benefits claimed.  24.3.1 Choosing between programs A self-employed person who has registered for the self-employed program may also have had other employment that is insured. They must choose under which part of the EI legislation they want to make a claim for special benefits.

1085,1085,"In order to establish a benefit period, the self-employed person must have experienced an interruption of earnings, and must attest to this in their initial EI application.  An interruption of earnings is considered as having occurred at the beginning of a week where the time devoted to a person's business activities has been reduced by more than 40% of their normal level (EIA 152.07(1)(c); EIR 14.01).  The reason for this reduction in activities must be related to illness, injury, quarantine, pregnancy, the need to care for a child or children referred to in subsection 152.05(1) of the Employment Insurance Act, the need to provide care or support to a family member referred to in subsection 152.06(1) of the Act or the need to provide care or support to a critically ill family member referred to in subsections 152.061(1) and 152.062(1) of the Act. For example, if a person adopts a child and reduces their usual 40-hour work week to 10 hours per week, they have reduced the time they devote to their business by 75%. In this case, therefore, the person would experience an interruption of earnings.The reality for the self-employed is that regardless of their need for special benefits, the business may be required to continue or it could face risk of closure. The business of farming is an example where, despite an illness, the farm must be maintained. Accordingly, it is not required that self-employed persons completely cease their self-employment activities in order to be eligible for benefits.  A self-employed person must advise the Commission if their participation in the business increases and they no longer meet this condition. This is because, in order to continue to be entitled to special benefits, a self-employed claimant must prove on an ongoing basis that they are unemployed. A self-employed person is no longer considered unemployed if their participation in the business increases such that they no longer have decreased the time devoted by more than 40% of the normal level (EIR 30).",51.63620507399578,13.826131078224105,13.319297830178854,16.578858350951375,16.64732293868922,11.268953488372096,59.47040169133193,8.818181818181818,3.710409755134252,0.606750822825565,0.4387279644311304,0.0526201503112738,0.8312541425228119,0.8734133839607239,4.7645348837209305,4.0,2.806723305546773,31.272727272727277,29.0,16.45981834148575,1.4593023255813953,1.0,0.761405968018459,344,142,0.4127906976744186,1687,11,24.3.2,Interruption of earnings,Chapter 24 - Benefits for the self-employed
1086,1086,"In order to establish a benefit period, claimants need to meet at least the minimum required annual earnings from self-employment within their qualifying period. The qualifying period is the entire calendar year prior to the year in which a claim for benefits commences (EIA 152.08(1)). This is the case regardless of when during the year the self-employed person makes a claim for benefits.  For example, if a self-employed person makes a claim at any point during the year 2019, their qualifying period is from January 1, 2018 until December 31, 2018. Within their qualifying period, the claimant must meet the set minimum annual earnings, which is the higher of either:$6,000or the amount fixed or determined in accordance with EIR 11.1, announced yearly in the Summary of the Actuarial Report on the EI Premium Rate. This amount is determined in concert with the indexation of maximum insurable earnings and so it may increase as the average wage in Canada increasesThe minimum annual earnings amount must be met with earnings gained from self-employment only; it cannot be combined with earnings from fishing and/or insured earnings from work with an employer (EIA 152.07(1)(d)).  Earnings which fall in one's qualifying period may be only be used once for the purposes of establishing a claim for benefits (EIA 152.08(2)). The year's earnings are not only required for a self-employed person to meet the entrance requirements but also serve to determine the weekly benefit rate, discussed further in section 24.5.0 of the Digest.",47.41599264705883,14.564387254901964,14.731742533061166,17.926470588235297,17.651147058823533,12.164078431372548,58.54166666666667,8.5,3.4815016220505752,0.3521001049253597,0.4544762896292031,0.0454238488237326,0.8695400357246399,0.8726513882478079,4.913725490196079,4.0,2.646567855703013,31.875,27.0,12.454291429061712,1.5019607843137257,1.0,0.7964357355211223,255,126,0.4941176470588235,1287,8,24.3.3,Self-employment earnings in the qualifying period,Chapter 24 - Benefits for the self-employed
1087,1087,"For those persons who commit misrepresentation against the EI system, resulting in a violation, the Employment Insurance Act prescribes a sanction in the form of an increased entrance requirement (section 18.10 of the Digest).  Depending on the kind of violation (section 18.10.2 of the Digest) and the level, there is a related increase in the amount of self-employment earnings required to qualify for benefits (EIA 152.07(1)(d)(ii)): a minor violation requires 25% more earningsa serious violation requires 50% more earningsa very serious violation requires 75% more earnings a subsequent violation requires 100% more earningsA violation will impact a self-employed person's entrance requirements from the date of the violation for the next 260 weeks or the next 2 established claims, whichever occurs first (EIA 152.07(7)).  The objective of this measure is to eliminate any advantage gained by the person as a result of making false statements and to deter repetition of such conduct.

1090,1090,"Employment Insurance (EI) benefits are not paid based on the personal needs or financial obligations of an individual. Equally, the fact that one has paid premiums to the EI fund does not by itself give rights to receive benefits as would be the case when purchasing an insurance policy. Eligibility depends on abiding by the various conditions established by the law. An individual who wishes to receive benefits must first indicate their intention by making a claim and proving that they meet the conditions necessary to establish a benefit period for which benefits may be payable in that period (FCA A-0541.85, CUB 10633; EIA 152.1(1)). Filing an initial claim allows the Canada Employment Insurance Commission (the Commission) to decide whether the self-employed person is qualified to receive benefits and notify the person of its decision (EIA 152.12). The Employment Insurance Regulations also provide for the making of claims for benefit by, and for the payment of benefits to, any person or agency on behalf of deceased or incapacitated persons or persons of unsound mind (EIR 27(1),  EIR 27(2)). There are 3 categories of claims for benefit: the initial, the continuing and the renewal claim. Only the initial claim establishes a benefit period (EIA 152.1(1)).

1091,1091,"Depending on the type of special benefit requested, there is a maximum number of weeks that can be paid in a benefit period. Any week for which $1.00 or more of benefits has been paid, reduces this maximum number (CUB 77020). Also deducted from this maximum are weeks for which no actual payment was made because of the following:benefits for a week was used to repay an overpayment (EIA 42(2); EIA 47);benefits for a week was applied against a penalty (EIA 38(1), EIA 38(2)) and/or;benefits for a week was transferred to a government or municipal authority as a refund of assistance already provided (EIA 42(3)).However, a week will not be deducted from the total number of weeks payable in a benefit period if, following reconsideration (section 24.16 of the Digest), the claimant was not entitled to any benefit for that week and an overpayment is established.  For example, a claimant received a full week of benefits and later contacts the Commission to declare earnings for that week.

1092,1092,"Under very specific conditions, a benefit period may be cancelled or terminated.  When a claimant requests a cancellation or termination of their benefit period, in order to allow them to make an informed decision, the Commission must inform the claimant of the advantages and disadvantages related to such action, and the finality of the decision.  For example, it may be to the claimant's advantage to cancel an earlier benefit period, as it may result in a longer qualifying period for a new claim, or a more advantageous start date for a new benefit period.

1094,1094,"The maximum number of weeks of self-employment special benefits that may be paid in a benefit period will vary, depending on the type(s) of special benefits sought. The length of the benefit period itself, without any extensions, is 52 weeks, which includes the waiting period, if it is to be served, during which no benefits are payable (EIA 152.11(2)). No further entitlement exists once these 52 weeks have elapsed, or in the case of an extension of the benefit period, 104 weeks have passed (EIA 152.11(15)), even if the claimant has not received the maximum number of weeks payable. A benefit period technically terminates after the claimant has received all weeks of special benefits to which they are entitled. However, where all those special benefits are paid before the end of 52 weeks, for example after 15 weeks of sickness benefits are paid, the benefit period will not be terminated immediately, as the claimant may become eligible to receive other types of special benefits (EIA 152.11(9)(a)).  Once the benefit period has terminated, it is up to the claimant to demonstrate that they meet the conditions required to establish a new benefit period.24.4.3.2.1 Early terminationA claimant may request to terminate their benefit period early in order to establish a new one immediately. This course of action may be advantageous when, for example, the benefit rate could become higher with a new claim or, after having received the maximum 15 weeks available on a claim, a claimant is still ill and can qualify to establish a new claim so that further sickness benefits could be paid.   Where the claimant requests an early termination of the benefit period, the request will be granted provided that the claimant makes an application for a new initial claim and qualifies to establish a new benefit period (EIA 152.11(9)(c)). In such case, the benefit period is terminated effective the Saturday preceding the start date of the new benefit period (EIA 152.11(3)).  A request to terminate a benefit period must be made within a reasonable time. A late request to terminate an established benefit period is considered to have been made at an earlier date if the claimant shows that good cause existed for the entire period of delay in making that request. It may be terminated earlier even if the benefit period has ended (EIA 152.11(10)) or even if benefits were paid after the date of the early termination. In such a case, an adjustment in the payment of benefits will be made. If no benefits were paid in the part of the benefit period which is before the date of early termination, the earlier benefit period may be cancelled (EIA 152.11(7)(a)).  In order to determine whether the claimant's reasons for delay constitute good cause, the principles concerning antedating, as found in Chapter 3 of the Digest, are to be followed. Jurisprudence has held that good cause is simply doing what a reasonable person would do to satisfy themselves as to their rights and obligations under the Act (FCA A-154-11, CUB 76454).",48.76012047455971,14.392435176125248,15.497558498333571,18.64584148727984,17.17624510763209,11.534011741682978,59.726149706457925,8.875,3.312020863462946,0.7018443324474501,0.4274936733658164,0.04308435883151,0.8674592932065328,0.8663239223616463,4.806262230919765,4.0,2.705296667723053,31.9375,31.0,11.07061848994897,1.4853228962818004,1.0,0.7933677155879286,511,194,0.3796477495107632,2521,16,24.4.3.2,Claim termination,Chapter 24 - Benefits for the self-employed
1095,1095,"The weekly benefit rate for a self-employed person is calculated by dividing the total of all self-employment earnings in the qualifying period (which is the entire calendar year prior to the year in which a claim for benefit commences (section 24.3 of the Digest; EIA 152.08(1)) by 52 weeks and multiplying the result by 55% or 33% for extended parental (EIA 152.16(1)). The benefit rate for a self-employed person may not exceed the maximum rate determined by the maximum yearly insurable earnings in effect during the year in which the claim is established. The maximum yearly insurable earnings is the income level up to which Employment Insurance (EI) premiums are paid (EIA 152.21(1)). It determines the maximum rate of weekly benefits paid for all types of benefits under the EI program. If the claimant meets or exceeds the maximum yearly insurable earnings for the year in which a claim is established, they will qualify for the maximum benefit rate available (EIA 152.16(2)).  For example, a self-employed person registered for the self-employed program in January 2019. They waited the requisite year and applied for benefits in January 2020. The claimant had $55,000 in earnings in their qualifying period, which is the year 2019. For claims established in 2020, the required annual earnings from self-employment in the qualifying period is set at $7,279. The self-employed person met this condition and their weekly rate was calculated as $55 000/52 x 55% = $582. However, the maximum benefit rate they could have received is $573. This is based on the 2020 maximum yearly insurable earnings threshold of $54,200. Note that the benefit rate may also include a Family Supplement. Self-employed workers who are in a low-income family (net income up to a maximum of $25,921 per year) with children, and who are in receipt of the Canada child benefit are eligible to receive the Family Supplement (section 1.9.4 of the Digest; EIA 152.17).",58.5964285714286,11.048571428571428,13.707050652182112,15.314285714285717,12.676160714285722,10.564166666666663,50.48809523809524,6.357142857142857,3.336296648363212,0.999852632345712,0.4334774791287397,0.0932752800382119,0.793554241840656,0.7999612887700399,4.693452380952381,4.0,2.526894383214879,24.0,19.0,14.696938456699067,1.4642857142857142,1.0,0.7550848039952133,336,138,0.4107142857142857,1629,14,24.5.0,Calculating the benefit rate ,Chapter 24 - Benefits for the self-employed

Over the years, jurisprudence has made a number of clarifications to the interpretation of the word misconduct. In one case, for example, the Federal Court of Appeal (FCA A-0213.09) held that :there can only be misconduct if the conduct is deliberate, that is, the actions that lead to the dismissal were conscious, willful and intentional. In other words, there is only misconduct when the claimant knows or should have known that his conduct would impede on his ability to execute his obligations towards his employer and that, as a result, it was possible for him to be dismissed.Principles which guide the adjudication of a dismissal to determine if misconduct was present are found in Chapter 7 of the Digest.

1104,1104,"With an employer-employee relationship, workers who require special benefits commonly take a period of leave without pay from their employment. The reality for the self-employed, however, is that regardless of their need for special benefits, the business may be required to continue or it could face risk of closure. The business of farming is an example where, despite an illness, the farm must be maintained. Accordingly, it is not required that self-employed persons completely cease their self-employment activities in order to be eligible, but demonstrate a reduction in the time devoted to their business activities by more than 40% of the normal level and then continue to experience a week of unemployment (EIR 30.1; section 24.3.2 of the Digest). Therefore, it follows that self-employed workers who continue to perform some work during their claim will also generate income from their business during the same period for which they are seeking special benefits. In some cases even though the self-employed person ceases to perform any work, the business may still continue to generate income for them and this income must be considered when determining the amount of benefits payable.Employment Insurance Regulation 35 lists what constitutes earnings to be deducted from any benefits payable to a claimant. Self-employment earnings for benefit purposes includes the entire income of a claimant arising out of any employment. Any income generated from self-employment, be it from the performance of service, a transaction or any other combination thereof, including profits, commission and farming subsidies, are deducted from benefits (EIR 35(2)). Earnings nullify the financial loss incurred by the claimant, so in order to prevent double indemnification, these benefits and advantages are deducted from benefits. The sole consideration in determining whether income is earnings for EI purposes lies in the relationship of that income to employment. If there is no direct correlation to employment, income earned by a claimant who requests EI benefits will not be deducted from benefits. For example, lottery winnings are not considered earnings since they are gained from luck, not work. Likewise, inheritance monies or capital gains from the sale of a personal home or cottage bear no link to employment and so are not earnings for EI purposes. The income of a self-employed claimant, including farmers, is the amount remaining after deducting the operating expenses excluding capital expenditures.Employment Insurance Regulation 36(6) explains where to allocate self-employment earnings in a benefit period. The provision makes a distinction between allocating earnings arising from the performance of service, or resulting from a transaction, as well as earnings that arise from neither, such as participation in profits or commissions. Exceptionally, earnings for self-employed fishers are determined and allocated based on the Employment Insurance (Fishing) Regulations.Further details on all elements of the determination and treatment of self-employment earnings are contained in section 5.16 of the Digest.",41.95933965348155,13.722140132941052,15.562485235769564,17.6218372016999,16.556551160509976,14.5903933747412,63.72333006429116,9.736842105263158,3.188772467650584,0.8447365280533211,0.46989578506199,0.0653524632824971,0.8671143187416924,0.8547796081094181,5.366459627329193,5.0,2.928455611593589,25.42105263157895,22.0,9.821114683619616,1.6438923395445135,1.0,0.9086078838233091,483,216,0.4472049689440994,2660,19,24.7.0,Earnings arising from self-employment ,Chapter 24 - Benefits for the self-employed

1107,1107,"Self-employment earnings and sickness benefitsMark is a self-employed IT consultant who works on contract. Mark registered with the EI program so he could access EI special benefits if needed. Some years later, Mark falls ill and is unable to continue working. He applies for EI sickness benefits. His benefit rate is set at $562 weekly. Mark receives the final payment of $1,200 for the last contract that he had completed before he became ill. Since he provided services over an 8-week period before he became ill and the start of his EI claim, the amount of his EI benefits is unaffected by the $1,200 payment.Self-employment earnings and parental benefitsAnne and her son Louis are co-owners of a campground. According to their partnership agreement, they divide the annual revenues equally between them. Anne and Louis registered with the EI program so they could access EI special benefits if needed.  Eighteen months later, Louis' wife gave birth to a child and Louis was eligible for 35 weeks of parental benefits. While Louis is no longer working, the business continues to generate income. In accordance with their partnership agreement, Louis continues to be entitled to half of the partnership's net income while he is on parental leave. During the week of July 8-14, Louis earned $300 in net income from camping services rendered. Earnings are deducted at a rate of 50 cents of EI benefits for every dollar earned during the week where services were rendered. Therefore, since 50% of his net self-employment earnings of $300 is $150, $150 will be deducted from his benefit rate for the week of July 8-14.Self-employment earnings and maternity, parental benefitsSimone is a real estate agent. Her income consists solely of commissions from the sale of houses. Simone registered with the EI program so she could access EI special benefits if needed.  Some years later, Simone has her first child and applies for maternity benefits. She is entitled to 15 weeks of maternity benefits and is claiming 61 weeks of extended parental benefits. Her benefit rate is calculated at $562 per week for maternity benefits and $337 per week for extended parental benefits. On September 9, a house listed by Simone before she left on leave sells and her net commission on the sale is $6,500. The amount of the commission is allocated to the weeks in which the work that gave rise to the transaction was performed, in other words, over 21 weeks (from the date of the listing until September 9). The amount to be allocated to each of the 21 weeks is $310 ($6,500 \u00f7 21 weeks). Earnings are deducted at a rate of 50 cents of EI benefits for every dollar earned during each week in which the work that gave rise to the transaction was performed. Therefore, since 50% of her allocated net self-employment commission earnings of $310 is $155, $155 will be deducted from her weekly benefit rate for that period. Self-employment earnings and compassionate care benefitsEric is a self-employed farmer who works year-round on his farm growing barley, wheat, and canola. Eric registered with the EI program in April 2018 so he could access EI special benefits if needed. In September 2019, Eric's mother becomes gravely ill with a significant risk of death within 26 weeks. He applies for EI compassionate care benefits and based on the medical certificate he provides, is entitled to the maximum 26 weeks of benefits. His benefit rate is established at $212 a week.  On October 17, 2019, Eric sells some of his barley, resulting in net farming earnings of $1,900 that are allocated to the weeks in which the work that gave rise to the transaction was performed. Since the work was performed from March 29 to August 19, 2019, his EI benefit amount is not affected by this transaction.",66.14593170511084,9.077137042062414,12.189075265870311,13.076436001809135,10.204739032112167,9.561910447761196,43.43735866123926,4.696969696969697,2.838529642269562,0.7957393860798033,0.458413669186373,0.0667590778132027,0.7171885883435607,0.7032147886291626,4.561194029850746,4.0,2.6296220274268576,20.303030303030305,18.0,8.350230802416611,1.4194029850746268,1.0,0.7402578828526027,670,224,0.3343283582089552,3135,33,24.7.1.2,Examples ,Chapter 24 - Benefits for the self-employed

1110,1110,"Once a self-employed person has registered for the Employment Insurance (EI) benefits for the self-employed program and waited the requisite 12 months from their registration date, six types of special benefits are available to them, should that person meet the qualifying and entitlement conditions. These are: sickness, maternity, parental, compassionate care, family caregiver benefits for children and family caregiver benefits for adults.  Self-employed residents of QuÃ©bec are only eligible for EI sickness, compassionate care and family caregiver benefits, given that maternity and parental benefits are offered to them through the QuÃ©bec Parental Insurance Plan (QPIP).  The entitlement conditions for special benefits for the self-employed mirror those that apply to special benefits available to applicants applying as insured employees or as self-employed fishers. However, there are some distinct differences which are presented in each section of this chapter as they relate directly to self-employment claims:sickness (section 24.9.0 of the Digest)maternity (section 24.10.0 of the Digest)parental (section 24.11.0 of the Digest)family caregiver benefits (section 24.12.0 of the Digest)compassionate care (section 24.13.0 of the Digest)An eligible claimant may be paid special benefits at any time in the benefit period, while respecting the specific time frame within which maternity, parental and compassionate care benefits are payable. To ensure consistency and stability in the payment of special benefits the maximum number of weeks for which special benefits may be paid is set by legislation (EIA 152.14(8)). These parameters are explained below.  24.8.1 Limits to the number of weeks of special benefits payable  Each type of special benefit has an individual maximum number of weeks payable in one benefit period (EIA 152.14(1)). Individual maximums are: maternity benefits, 15 weeksstandard parental benefits, 35 weeksextended parental benefits, 61 weekssickness benefits, 26 weeks family caregiver benefits for children, 35 weeksfamily caregiver benefits for adults, 15 weekscompassionate care benefits, 26 weeksSpecial benefits may be paid in any combination during a benefit period, provided the claimant proves entitlement for each type of benefit claimed. A maximum of 102 weeks of different types of special benefits may be paid if the initial benefit period is extended by a maximum of 104 weeks. This can only happen if, during the initial 52 weeks benefit period (EIA 152.11(14)): more than one type of special benefits was paid; and at least one of these special benefits was paid for fewer than the applicable maximum number of weeks payable for these special benefits; andthe maximum total number of weeks payable for the types of special benefits requested is greater than 50If a specific type of special benefits was not paid during the initial benefit period, it cannot be paid during the extended benefit period. For example, where maternity, parental and compassionate care benefits were paid during the initial 52-week benefit period, the claimant would be entitled to receive additional weeks of maternity, parental and compassionate care during the extension (provided the specific time frame within which these benefits are payable has not passed). In this example, since illness benefits were not paid during the initial benefit period, they could not be paid during the extended period. Regarding the QuÃ©bec Parental Insurance Plan (QPIP), EI legislation introduced a principle of equivalence which applies to EI special benefits for the self-employed. Each week of provincial benefits paid to a self-employed person in a benefit period is considered as a week for which benefits are paid under the EI program if the claimant would have been entitled to the corresponding benefits under the EI program (EIR 76.36).

1112,1112,"The Employment Insurance Act does not use a specific term to designate the type of benefits paid in case of an inability to work by reason of illness, injury or quarantine. The term sickness benefits has been adopted to refer to these type of benefits (EIA 152.03(1)):  Subject to this Part, a self-employed person who ceases to work as a self-employed person because of a prescribed illness, injury or quarantine and who would be otherwise working, is entitled to receive benefits while unable to work as a self-employed person for that reason.

Given that for self-employed workers, a week of unemployment is defined as a reduced work week (by more than 40% of time devoted to the business), the terminology 'while unable to work', carries the same conditions for the purposes of self-employment special benefits (section 24.6.2 of the Digest).

1114,1114,"When applying for sickness benefits, an individual must declare that, if not for their illness, they would otherwise be working in the normal activities of their business or normal activities which support the continuation of their business (EIA 152.03(4); EIR 30(2)). Claimants receiving parental benefits, compassionate care or family caregiver benefits who wish to convert to sickness benefits, and who provide proof of incapacity, are exempt from showing they would otherwise be working in the normal activities of their business or normal activities that support the continuation of their business.  A person may wish to take advantage of a period of incapacity to take a short-duration training course or spend the period of convalescence away from home, such as a cottage or relatives' area of residence. Because such situations would not have arisen if the individual had been able to work, it cannot be said that the claimant has not proven that they would otherwise be working for that period. On the other hand, in the case of a stay outside Canada, entitlement to benefits would be determined under a separate section of the EI legislation (section 24.9.4.2 of the Digest). There may be situations where the otherwise working condition is not met. For example, self-employed persons who have temporarily halted their self-employment and later are affected by illness, injury or quarantine cannot usually prove that they would be otherwise working unless their inability to work has delayed a planned return to their business activities. In this case, they may be able to demonstrate that they would be otherwise working if not for their incapacity, but only from the original date set for their return to their business activities. Another situation is where a self-employed worker discontinued their self-employment altogether (through, for example, a sale or closure of the business or in the event of a bankruptcy) and subsequently filed for self-employment sickness benefits. The legislated otherwise working criteria would not be met. If not for their illness, individuals in these circumstances would not be working in self-employment or working by supporting the continuation of a business. Self-employed individuals who carry out their self-employment entirely during certain periods of the year would not be able to meet the condition that they would otherwise be working were it not for their illness, injury, or quarantine during the times of the year when they would normally not do any work at all. This does not include periods when they would be performing the normal activities for the continuation of their business (section 24.9.2.1 of the Digest).",43.56502117148906,15.51477064220184,15.903189008614271,19.3786873676782,19.126891319689484,13.01412844036697,64.27240649258998,10.307692307692308,3.608231037973269,0.8359992441899547,0.4129151918596409,0.0547015023706497,0.8147129714488983,0.8707789128476923,5.0504587155963305,4.0,2.797807918242095,33.53846153846154,35.0,12.97699375294237,1.5275229357798166,1.0,0.8276607424058612,436,171,0.3922018348623853,2254,13,24.9.2,Second entitlement condition: be otherwise working,Chapter 24 - Benefits for the self-employed

1118,1118,"A person who is temporarily unable to work may plan to spend part of their convalescence in milder climates outside Canada or, conversely, a person who is outside Canada suddenly becomes unable to work. However, the Act provides as follows (EIA 152.2(b)): Except as may otherwise be prescribed, a self-employed person is not entitled to receive benefits for any period during which the personis an inmate of a prison or similar institution; or is not in Canada.An exception to this provision is provided in Employment Insurance Regulations 55.01(a). A self-employed person is not disentitled from receiving benefits when the person is outside Canada for the purpose of undergoing, at a hospital, medical clinic or similar facility outside Canada, medical treatment that is not readily or immediately available in the self-employed person's area of residence in Canada. The hospital, clinic or facility must be accredited to provide the medical treatment by the appropriate governmental authority outside Canada.  Thus, in addition to the 2 entitlement conditions (being unable to work due to illness, injury and quarantine and be otherwise working), a person must satisfy 2 other specific conditions:The person who is outside Canada must in fact be undergoing medical treatment in a hospital, medical clinic or similar facility located in a country other than Canada; and, The treatment must be one that is not readily available in the claimant's area of residence in Canada. It is not necessary that the claimant be hospitalized.It must not be a miracle treatment or any kind of cure that is claimed to be the panacea for all illnesses, but a treatment that, while not necessarily conventional, may be seen as being relatively effective and is recognized by a scientific or medical authority (See various jurisprudence). There are several factors that might lead someone who is unable to work to undergo medical treatment in a country other than Canada. It might be due to, amongst others: the urgency of the situation as opposed to the immediate availability of the treatment in a Canadian health institution, the proximity of the residence to the treatment centre, the supposed quality of care, or the technological advancements and expertise of certain medical science authorities or clinics renowned for the treatment of certain illnesses or for certain procedures. A facility outside Canada that offers a treatment prescribed in Canada is considered to be an accredited facility. The Act leaves no room for other circumstances that could occur where a person might, for personal reasons or on the recommendation of a physician, have to stay outside the country, even with a medical certificate establishing the inability to work (see various jurisprudence).The prescription applies to a person whose inability to work arose before or while they were outside Canada.

This disentitlement does not apply to situations where the amount of provincial benefits that the self-employed person is entitled to receive under a provincial plan is not substantially equivalent to the amount of benefits that they would be entitled to under the Employment Insurance Act.

A person who has received or is entitled to receive benefits from a provincial plan will see their EI benefits reduced by an amount equal to those provincial benefits in addition to any other deduction (EIR 76.37, EIR 76.38; EIA 152.05(11), EIA152.18).",40.89141840087626,15.053800657174154,17.54021597470382,20.506462212486312,17.494644030668127,12.973493975903612,65.42278203723987,10.636363636363637,3.134210681992019,1.2039331657079992,0.4430606035353595,0.1604930680433226,0.6923733301460743,0.6210391066140599,5.0602409638554215,4.0,2.8585083210399254,30.181818181818183,31.0,13.61695588607475,1.5993975903614457,1.0,0.8603023416394602,332,139,0.4186746987951807,1719,11,24.11.1,Who can receive parental benefits,Chapter 24 - Benefits for the self-employed

1129,1129,"Under the EI program, parental benefits are payable to parents to care for one or more newborn children or one or more children placed with the claimant for the purpose of adoption.   Parental benefits therefore provide a means of financial support allowing a parent(s) to be away from work entirely, or to an extent that they would still be considered unemployed during weeks they are receiving benefits to care for the child (EIR 30(1)).    Parental legislation has evolved over the years to where it no longer refers to remaining at home to care for the child. It is unreasonable to expect a parent to cease all regular activity and simply remain at home for 35 or 61 weeks to care for the child. While the intent of the legislation is to allow the parent to bond with and care for the child, when the parent is providing for the needs of the child the requirement of caring for the child is met. This means a claimant may leave the home for periods and continue to receive parental benefits, whether the child is with the parent during these activities or not.    A reasoned approach should be taken and each case should be decided on its own merit having regard for the intent to allow a parent to care for the child. It has been argued that a child who is admitted to hospital cannot be considered to be in the care of the parent, therefore no entitlement to parental benefits exists. The reality of this situation is that the parent continues to be responsible for the child. Furthermore, in many cases the parent's presence and assistance is specifically requested by either the doctor or the hospital.   This same reasoning holds true for those claimants who decide to take a vacation while in receipt of parental benefits. Because payment of these benefits has no tie to availability, a claimant on vacation can be entitled to parental benefits.",57.91886363636365,12.012575757575757,13.81666964889586,16.09090909090909,13.814727272727277,9.95781818181818,50.83333333333333,6.416666666666667,3.0382282481278247,0.6434353650303095,0.4901054295546986,0.0475489022349395,0.9101996963674372,0.8943831741809845,4.563636363636364,4.0,2.5519829701410246,27.5,28.0,7.932002689527196,1.4303030303030304,1.0,0.7485277867698531,330,149,0.4515151515151515,1521,12,24.11.4,Second entitlement condition: to care for a child,Chapter 24 - Benefits for the self-employed
1130,1130,"A one-week waiting period must be served in respect of one newborn or adoptive child when an initial benefit period is established and before parental benefits can be paid (EIA 152.15).   The waiting period may be waived if, after having ceased work, the claimant received sick leave paid by an employer. When the claimant works for more than one employer, if they were paid sick leave pay after ceasing work from one of these employers and had an interruption of earnings for the same employer the conditions have been met to waive the waiting period.   When the first parent made a claim for benefits, served the waiting period, and during this benefit period claims maternity and/or parental benefits, the waiting period can be deferred for any other parent claiming parental benefits in respect of the same child (EIA 152.05(14)). When parents decide to share parental benefits and apply simultaneously, they may choose which one will serve the waiting period, allowing the other parent to defer their waiting period.    Deferring a waiting period is different from waiving one. If a waiting period is deferred, it must eventually be served before a parent can receive other types of benefits such as regular (for Part I claimants), sickness, compassionate care or family caregiver benefits on the same claim (EIA 152.05(14)). However, a waiting period can be deferred on a second benefit period that is established so that the claimant receives all parental benefits that the legislation allows within the parental window.    If the waiting period was waived for the first parent, the other parent would be required to serve the waiting period, unless the latter meets the conditions to have the waiting period waived.Employment Insurance Regulation 76.22 authorizes waiving the waiting period where benefits have been paid under a provincial plan such as the QuÃ©bec Parental Insurance Plan.",44.78690575079875,14.78824600638978,15.112257680678326,18.143003194888177,17.664664536741213,12.522811501597442,58.1370607028754,8.4,3.2088395205328246,0.5562681392257423,0.4125565285577024,0.043868298799461,0.8694253696335686,0.8662488162517548,4.977635782747604,5.0,2.465638263464357,31.3,32.5,10.373523991392702,1.5399361022364215,1.0,0.7703590273767458,313,139,0.4440894568690096,1583,10,24.11.5.1,Waiting period,Chapter 24 - Benefits for the self-employed
1131,1131,"There are 2 options for receiving parental benefits, standard and extended parental benefits.    Standard parental benefits are payable for a maximum of 35 weeks at a benefit rate of 55% of a claimant's weekly insurable earnings, up to a maximum amount. The benefits must be claimed within 52 weeks after the week the child is born or placed for the purpose of adoption (EIA 152.14(1)(b), EIA 152.05(2)).    Extended parental benefits are payable for a maximum of 61 weeks at a lower benefit rate of 33% of a claimant's weekly insurable earnings, up to a maximum amount. The benefits must be claimed within 78 weeks after the week the child is born or placed for the purpose of adoption (EIA 152.14(1)(b), EIA 152.05(2)).    The implementation of the parental sharing benefit on March 17, 2019 added weeks to standard and extended parental benefits. If more than one parent requests parental benefits for the same child, they can claim an additional 5 weeks of standard parental or an additional 8 weeks of extended parental benefits. This increases the maximum shareable standard parental benefits to 40 weeks and the maximum shareable extended parental benefits to 69 weeks (EIA 152.05(12). This applies even if one parent makes a claim for benefits under Part I and the other parent makes a claim under Part VII.1 (EIA 23(4.1)). However, one claimant cannot receive more than 35 standard weeks or 61 extended weeks of parental benefits per birth or placement and per benefit period.   Parents sharing benefits are required to select the same option, either standard or extended. The option chosen by the first parent who completes the EI application binds the other parent(s) to the same option (EIA 152.05(1.3)). Once parental benefits have been paid on a claim, the claimant's choice to receive standard or extended parental benefit is irrevocable (EIA 152.05(1.2)).    The Quebec Parental Insurance Plan introduced a principle of equivalence for the purposes of the EI program, which applies to EI special benefits for the self-employed. Each week of provincial benefits paid to a self-employed person in a benefit period is considered as a week for which benefits are paid under the EI program if the claimant would have been entitled to the corresponding benefits under the EI program (EIR 76.36). Accordingly, each of these weeks is considered in calculating the overall maximum number of weeks of EI parental benefits payable during a benefit period and in calculating the maximum number of weeks of EI benefits payable with regard to a birth or an adoption (please see the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan on the Government of Canada website).   Eligible parents can also share the number of weeks of parental benefits payable under the EI program and the parental or adoption benefits payable under a provincial plan, such as the QPIP for the same birth or adoption of a child (EIR 76.42). However, the maximum number of weeks of benefits that can be paid under the EI program cannot exceed the maximum number of 40 weeks less the number of weeks of benefits that have been paid to the other parent (taking into account any weeks of benefits that are paid at the accelerated rate under the provincial plan (EIR 76.42(3)).    In cases of extended parental benefits, the maximum number of weeks of benefits that can be paid to a parent is determined by using the following formula (A - B) x C \u00f7 D, where: A is 40, the maximum number of weeks of standard parental benefits when the weeks of benefits are shared (EIA 152.14(2)(b)(i)) B is the number of weeks of benefits that are paid to the claimant governed by the provincial plan (taking into account, where appropriate, the weeks of benefits that are paid at the accelerated rate under the provincial plan) (EIR 76.4(3)) C is 61, the maximum number of weeks of extended parental benefits payable per benefit period (EIA 152.14(1)(b)(ii))D is 35, the maximum number of weeks of standard parental benefits payable per benefit period (EIA 152.14(1)(b)(i))",43.40195962580012,15.214467187170287,16.89850594216032,20.103509882535,17.341573468382926,11.561418020679469,62.07561370190617,9.61904761904762,3.47829130207378,0.735130960362315,0.4813574195400397,0.063651422465834,0.8334089338779449,0.8668508435550489,4.809453471196455,4.0,2.677224774469727,32.23809523809524,27.0,13.230213481000012,1.5450516986706055,1.0,0.825977710070945,677,187,0.276218611521418,3332,21,24.11.5.2,Limits to the number of weeks payable,Chapter 24 - Benefits for the self-employed
1132,1132,"Parental benefits are payable at any time during the benefit period and the parental window (EIA 152.05(2), (EIA 152.05(5.1)). These weeks do not have to be consecutive.    The standard parental benefits window:begins with the week in which the child is born or placed with the claimant for purposes of adoption ends 52 weeks after that week The extended parental benefits window:begins with the week in which the child is born or placed with the claimant for purposes of adoptionends 78 weeks after that weekIf the child is hospitalized, the window may be extended by the number of weeks the child is in the hospital, up to a maximum of 104 weeks (EIA 152.05(3),(4)). This provision allows parents to care for their child or children during a period critical to the children's development and the extensions allow flexibility as to when the parental benefits may be requested.    When extending the parental window for hospitalization of a child, the benefit period is also extended for the weeks of hospitalization that fall within the parental window (EIA 152.11(13)). However, the benefit period does not change the maximum number of benefit weeks to which the claimant is entitled.     Even when the claimant is within this window, no benefits are paid if they are no longer eligible or not entitled to them or if the claim has exhausted by duration.

1140,1140,"Care of a critically ill or injured care recipient is defined as all care that is required because of the care recipient's state of health, other than the care provided by a health care professional (EIR 1(5)).

Care or support of a critically ill or injured child or adult includes (EIR 1(5)):directly providing or participating in the care; orproviding psychological and emotional support; orarranging for care of the critically ill or injured child or adult by a third party care providerThe individual may provide direct or indirect care or support to the care recipient. For example, the claimant may simply spend time each day with the care recipient in the home, a hospice or a medical facility. Any period during which an individual is claiming this type of benefit is a time of great personal stress and the claimant may require a short break from providing care or support in order to deal with this stress. Therefore, benefits should not be denied where the claimant does not actually deliver care for a few days. A reasonable approach should be taken and each case should be decided on its own merit. There will be situations where the claimant resides in a different geographical area than the critically ill family member and may arrange for the delivery of care or may provide psychological and emotional support from wherever he or she resides. The legislation provides the opportunity to respond to these situations. In any situation where it becomes apparent that the claimant is not providing care or support, based on the definition above, the claimant would be disentitled from benefits (section 24.6.0 of the Digest).

When a claimant is prevented from making a claim because of providing care or support to a care recipient, a lenient approach will be applied, keeping in mind the provisions of family caregiver legislation (section 3.3.5 of the Digest). Therefore, if a request is made asking the Commission to consider that the claim was made at an earlier date, and this request is approved, the period could begin at that earlier day (Chapter 3 of the Digest).

When a claimant is prevented from making a claim because of providing care or support to a seriously ill family member, a lenient approach will be applied, keeping in mind the provisions of the compassionate care legislation (section 3.3.5 of the Digest). Therefore, if a request is made asking the Commission to consider that the claim was made at an earlier date, and this request is approved, the period could begin at that earlier day (Chapter 3 of the Digest). The first medical certificate submitted that meets the requirements of the legislation determines the start of the 52-week window.

1166,1166,"Work-Sharing is designed to help employers and workers avoid layoffs when there is a temporary reduction in the normal level of business activity, due to factors beyond the employer's control. Work-Sharing requires an agreement between the employer, affected workers, and the Canada Employment Insurance Commission (the Commission). It provides income support in the form of EI benefits to eligible workers who temporarily work a reduced work week under an approved Work-Sharing agreement, while their employer attempts to return to normal levels of activity.When an employer applies for a Work-Sharing agreement, the employer must agree to aim for a reduction of between 10% and 60% in the employees' regular work schedule over the term of the agreement. Workers agree to work a reduced week and to share the available work equally over the term of the Work-Sharing agreement, to avoid layoffs. The goal is for all participating employees to return to normal working hours by the end of the term of the Work-Sharing agreement.The program helps employers retain skilled employees and avoid the costly process of recruiting and training new employees when business returns to normal levels. It also helps employees maintain their skills and jobs by supplementing their wages with EI benefits for the days they are not working due to the Work-Sharing agreement.Employers must develop a Recovery Plan to indicate what activities or measures they will be implementing during the Work-Sharing period that would result in a return to normal employment levels by the end of the agreement. The Recovery Plan forms part of, and is integral to, the Work-Sharing agreement.Once a Work-Sharing agreement ends, the employer must serve a mandatory cooling-off period of a number of weeks equal to, or greater than, the period covered by the previous Work-Sharing agreement before entering a new Work-Sharing agreement involving the same work unit.",50.407727272727286,13.455454545454549,13.88584557914918,16.511363636363637,16.503548295454543,12.380374999999995,61.59090909090909,9.454545454545457,3.3186674458507657,0.4958087380094257,0.4489964266872214,0.0205355889679005,0.8878633439540863,0.9075656533241272,4.965625,4.0,2.5984501841241827,29.09090909090909,29.0,8.887729492800176,1.5,1.0,0.75,320,136,0.425,1631,11,25.1.1,Introduction,Chapter 25 - Work-Sharing

1171,1171,"To be eligible to be part of the Work-Sharing unit, an employee must be eligible for EI benefits. EI eligibility cannot be determined before an individual actually files for benefits and employees are not required to disclose their eligibility status to their employer or to the program officer. Therefore, the employer may identify any worker of a potential Work-Sharing unit, in the submission for the Work-Sharing agreement, even though there may be workers who will not be eligible for EI benefits.All Work-Sharing participants must be core employees. Core employees are those employees who are required to carry out the day-to-day functions of the business. Core employees must be year-round, permanent full-time or part-time employees of the company. Employers should reduce staff to core levels prior to entering into a Work-Sharing agreement.Temporary (in other words, term or contract) employees are considered to be eligible core employees provided they are not employed on a seasonal basis. Temporary employees are only eligible if they have maintained hours similar to permanent full-time or part-time employees within the last 12 months. Employees hired on a casual or on-call basis or through a temporary help agency are not eligible. Some employers have long-standing agreements with temporary help agencies and consider these employees to be a part of the company. However, for the purposes of participating in a Work-Sharing agreement, these employees are not included.Employees hired on a seasonal basis, such as students hired for the summer or for a co-op term are not eligible for the program. However, students not employed on a seasonal basis may participate.Employees who are paid by piece work are eligible to participate in a Work-Sharing agreement. Piece work is defined as payment based on the amount of goods produced, rather than hours worked.Foreign workers with a valid work permit have the same rights and responsibilities as Canadian citizens and permanent residents, and therefore, may participate in the Work-Sharing program. Employees who are minor shareholders in the business and whose shares do not provide them with significant decision-making power within the company are eligible to participate in the Work-Sharing program. Pursuant to paragraph 5(2)(b) of the EIA, employment of a person who controls more than 40% of the voting shares in the company is not insurable employment. Consequently, a worker in this situation would not be eligible to participate in the Work-Sharing program, as an employee.Some employers may have been unable to avoid layoffs prior to applying to participate in the Work-Sharing program. Core employees who were in layoff status prior to the agreement start date may be eligible to participate.A claimant may work for more than one employer at the same time; however, the employee cannot collect Work-Sharing benefits under more than 1 Work-Sharing agreement at the same time. Employment from all employers in a claimant's qualifying period will be taken into account when calculating the employee's Work-Sharing benefits. Where a claimant is participating in more than 1 Work-Sharing agreement, they may choose under which agreement they wish to be paid EI benefits.

1172,1172,"A Work-Sharing  unit is a group of EI eligible core employees who have agreed to reduce  their normal working hours in order to share the available work and avoid  layoffs. There must be a minimum of 2 EI  eligible employees in each Work-Sharing  unit. The Work-Sharing  unit generally includes all employees in a single job description or all  employees in the same department, division, plant or operational unit of a  company. The Work-Sharing unit  does not necessarily include all of the employees in the company. A Work-Sharing agreement with a  large company may be comprised of several Work-Sharing units with different job descriptions or from  different departments, while a smaller company may have only 1 Work-Sharing unit. Employees who form a Work-Sharing unit should perform similar job duties so that they  can share the available work. All employees who are part of the Work-Sharing unit must reduce their regular hours of  work on an equal basis (in other words, same percentage of reduction). If  during the period of the Work-Sharing  agreement, work activities increase, the additional hours of work must  be shared equally among all employees in the Work-Sharing unit. Employees who do different work but whose jobs  impact one another (in other words, slowdown in business affects one job  resulting in less work for another job or jobs) may be part of the Work-Sharing unit, provided  all employees reduce their hours equally. If the employer cannot ensure that  the available work will be shared equally among all employees from any aspect  of the operation, an amendment to the Work-Sharing agreement may be negotiated.Employees who share the same job description (or do similar  work) as those in a Work-Sharing  unit, but do not wish to participate in a Work-Sharing agreement or who are not  eligible to receive EI benefits are still required to reduce their hours of  work on an equal basis as employees who are participating in a Work-Sharing agreement.  Individual workers cannot volunteer to participate in Work-Sharing while others 'opt out' and  continue to work normal hours. Employees who are needed to help generate work and thus  assist in the recovery of the business should not be included in the Work-Sharing unit. Examples  include senior management, executive level marketing and sales agents, outside  sales representatives, or technical employees engaged in product development.  In other words, employees performing functions essential to the development and  implementation of the recovery of the business should be working full-time in  support of the recovery plan. Other supervisors/managers are eligible to take  part and may be included in the Work-Sharing  unit, as long as they are not determining the direction of the company. Some businesses  (typically smaller businesses) may have only one employee in each job category  (in other words, all employees in the business are doing a different job).  Provided the employer can clearly demonstrate that participation in Work-Sharing will avoid the temporary layoff of at least 1  employee, employees with different job descriptions may form one Work-Sharing unit. The employees must all agree to the  same percentage of reduction to their normal working hours. Once an agreement is  in place, if a different group of employees becomes affected by the same work  shortage, the employer may submit an amendment request in order to add this new  unit to the agreement. The new Work-Sharing unit will not be eligible for the full term of the agreement; they will have the same end date as the  original Work-Sharing unit(s). However, if a different group of  employees is affected by a new work shortage (in other words, another set of  circumstances beyond the control of the employer), a new application for an  agreement may be submitted by the  employer for a new full-length term.",50.741332288401296,14.04128526645768,14.874696292769784,17.999373040752353,15.914776645768027,10.138333333333335,58.6478578892372,8.545454545454545,3.2818584232675025,0.7838734904243503,0.4361530668193378,0.0478159882845454,0.8821458844911485,0.8740193009376526,4.570402298850575,4.0,2.7850561518917565,31.63636363636364,31.0,11.33997536691831,1.4655172413793105,1.0,0.8104670976476475,696,207,0.2974137931034483,3219,22,25.2.1.3,Work-Sharing unit at place of employment,Chapter 25 - Work-Sharing

Violations range from minor to subsequent, with a varied increase in the number of hours required to qualify for benefits.

1183,1183,"The number of weeks of regular benefits, to which a claimant may be entitled, is determined at the time a claim is calculated; this includes claims for Work-Sharing benefits. The number of weeks is based on the number of hours of insurable employment accumulated in the claimant's qualifying period, and the rate of unemployment in the area in which they reside.A week in which Work-Sharing benefits are paid does not reduce the number of weeks a claimant may later receive. For example, after a number of weeks of Work-Sharing benefits, an employer may experience a complete shutdown and lay off all workers for a short period. The weeks of Work-Sharing already paid to these workers will not reduce the number of weeks of regular benefits that could be paid on their claim. Similarly, weeks of Work-Sharing do not normally affect a claimant's entitlement to special benefits (sickness, maternity, parental, compassionate care or family caregiver benefits).However, if a claimant claims and receives weeks of regular benefits, the total weeks payable, as determined when the benefit period was established, will be reduced accordingly.",45.81259803921572,14.612058823529413,15.688483145680364,18.6698752228164,17.476648841354724,12.367272727272727,60.57843137254902,9.166666666666666,3.358747354433382,0.569409111691837,0.4988663502350207,0.0685113260761143,0.8890223383903504,0.9073644429445268,4.951871657754011,5.0,2.81569972583994,31.166666666666668,28.5,9.081421817216851,1.5294117647058822,1.0,0.8608795256727588,187,92,0.4919786096256685,956,6,25.3.6,Weeks of entitlement,Chapter 25 - Work-Sharing

1195,1195,"The primary goal of the Work-Sharing legislation is to pay claimants for work they miss because of the Work-Sharing agreement. Regardless of the pay period type (weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly or monthly), most employees work regular hours in each calendar week of the year. Even when hours vary from week-to-week, they average in a manner that allows appropriate payment of Work-Sharing benefits for any loss of employment under the Work-Sharing agreement.However, there are situations where employees do not work a conventional schedule. This may be due to the nature of the work itself, or due to the way in which the employer and employees have agreed to manage the work. This does not include patterns of work in which a claimant's regular schedule includes lay days (Digest 4.3.5).For example, flight attendants are federally restricted in the total number of hours of flight time per month. The hourly loss of employment for the purposes of Work-Sharing cannot be accurately calculated on a calendar week basis. This is because the employment can be extended or compressed into irregular patterns, based on the flight attendant's ability and willingness to work, within the restrictions of the law. Historically, flight attendants work approximately 75 hours over a period of approximately 1 month. When they work less than 75 hours, the hours lost can only be considered in the context of the 1 month period. In this specific case, strict application of the requirement to have one half hour of work in each calendar week does not meet the intent of the Work-Sharing legislation.Although these cases are highly exceptional situations, in cases where work patterns may not be traditional, the program officer will examine the employer's scheduling history and decide if the conventional application of one half hour of job duties in a calendar week will correctly identify weeks in which there is a loss of employment due to Work-Sharing. If the conventional manner of defining a Work-Sharing week will not fairly compensate an employee for the loss of work, the Commission may develop a formula that considers the true loss of work and allows appropriate payment of benefits. There is no pre-set formula, since these situations are not always pre-set. The legislation therefore allows flexibility and the calculation will respond to the specific circumstances of that employment. The program officer maintains control over the final determination, but must advise the Commission of exceptional situations, to facilitate the correct payment of Work-Sharing benefits.Report navigationPrevious part of reportTable of contents Go to Table of contentsNext part of report",50.9298124078789,12.570925901112153,14.299716787436791,16.251963017553262,15.053222564652287,12.48054669703872,54.06954307919067,7.294117647058823,2.984871779671934,0.6904391389852653,0.4597055980034925,0.0932014342902462,0.852173212915659,0.835863184928894,5.004555808656036,4.0,2.9141047646677745,25.823529411764707,25.0,11.110330614647884,1.533029612756264,1.0,0.9071609203122472,439,185,0.4214123006833713,2255,17,25.6.2,Non-conventional work patterns,Chapter 25 - Work-Sharing

The digest contains chapters that discuss these reasons for separation from employment, including how they are adjudicated and the impact they have on a claim for benefits (Digest 6; Digest 7).Report navigationPrevious part of reportTable of contents Go to Table of contentsNext part of report",20.542647058823547,18.84058823529412,18.599290044081556,22.22745098039216,22.398529411764702,16.822352941176472,72.23529411764706,13.0,3.0807531840140534,0.3591436793851765,0.5347222222222222,0.0491046375823991,0.877254843711853,0.88370281457901,5.696078431372549,5.0,3.505707435211829,34.0,38.0,10.98483803552272,1.7941176470588236,1.0,1.19916830078607,102,67,0.6568627450980392,595,3,25.9.3,Voluntary leaving leave of absence suspension dismissal,Chapter 25 - Work-Sharing
1209,1209,"A benefit repayment  (also referred to as a clawback) is applied to the EI benefits paid to a claimant when their net income, as defined in the Income Tax Act,  exceeds 1.25 times the maximum yearly insurable earnings. General information about benefit  repayment and BRAC can be found in section 1.9.6 of this Digest. There are no special considerations set out in the act or regulations with respect to  benefit repayment and Work-Sharing benefits. Therefore, the provisions of section 4 of the EIA apply to Work-Sharing benefits paid.  However, such a repayment adjustment does not apply to a claimant who  has not been paid any regular benefits, including Work-Sharing benefits, in the  10 years prior to the relevant taxation year.
